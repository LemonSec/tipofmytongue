1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:11,400
I thank you very much we are talking

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,660
about the human factor in cybersecurity

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,099
and the humans are missing in the room I

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,109
guess the people who are sitting in the

5
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:20,849
back if they can cooperate with me a

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,970
little bit and come to the front it'll

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:31,769
be a great great service to whatever we

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:33,870
are going to do so volunteer please all

9
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,690
right so I think we are already running

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:41,330
behind the schedule and I would like to

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:45,629
keep it as tight as I am asked to do

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:48,239
before I call my panelists which also

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,880
was a was a bit of a surprise for me

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,810
because you know many a people due to

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,540
the obvious coronavirus had canceled

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:03,180
their trip so I had to I had to kind of

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:07,439
assemble a panel overnight yeah actually

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,420
overnight you are right so let me let me

19
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,148
just invite the panelists here and then

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,130
we'll do a small brief on what we are

21
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:17,189
going to discuss what is this human

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,979
factor and then would seek participation

23
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,329
from all of you who are in the room so

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,759
please welcome forum Mehta forum is the

of the one of the big force in the

47
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:50,530
advisory and consulting space so you

48
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:53,170
know before before we go on to crucify

49
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,730
these panelists with with what questions

50
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,890
I have not I have not given them any

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,820
preparation so all of them will have a

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,850
surprise check on their knowledge so I

53
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:07,510
was referring to to a slightly dated

54
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:12,430
research from the University of oh yes

55
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,620
sorry so as we talk you will see you you

56
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,480
will see our friend what sell from me by

57
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,570
doing a mind map which is a live mind

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,130
map which means that whatever they are

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,500
speaking is going to be projected here

60
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,769
and those who are interested in having

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,980
that knowledge later on can please let

62
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,350
us know we'll mail this to you so as I

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,920
said that I was referring to a slightly

64
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:39,310
dated research which happened in 2018 at

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,589
the University of Maryland it's an

66
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,600
academic it's an academic paper it's not

67
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,440
a research done by any InfoSec company

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,049
or group and you know very just the

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,709
abstract part of it I will I will read

70
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:57,010
for you and it gives a gives a flavor of

71
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,680
how ignorant we are about the human

72
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,340
factor in cyber security domain so it

73
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,739
says that

74
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,129
human factor remains unexplored and

75
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,860
underappreciated in information security

76
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:11,739
mark these two words unexplored and

77
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,530
underappreciated the mounting

78
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:18,250
cyberattacks data breaches ransomware

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:22,360
attacks as a result of human enabled

80
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:25,930
errors in fact are they are 95 percent

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,530
of all cyber incidents which are human

82
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,810
enabled 95 percent and whom do we blame

83
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,450
at the end of it is that technology is

84
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:39,250
not working or the seesaw is bad

85
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,020
research indicates that existing

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,900
information security plans do not

87
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,810
account for human factors in risk

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,030
management or auditing corporate

89
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,510
executives managers and cyber security

90
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,580
professionals rely extensively on

91
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:59,020
technology to avert cyber security

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,109
incidents and very fallaciously believe

93
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,539
that technology is the key to improving

94
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,460
security defenses even though the

95
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,940
research says otherwise that new

96
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:12,750
technologies create unintended

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:18,340
consequences nonetheless technology in

98
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:20,289
induced errors are all human enabled so

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,138
you're getting my point you know even if

100
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:28,139
the technology is foolproof technology

101
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:32,500
is proven its tested it's done the the

102
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:34,630
the induction of error in the technology

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,260
solution or technology deployment is all

104
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,620
human related so you know another very

105
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,210
startling fact if I if I tell you that

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:50,250
in here 2015 and it's a very very 5-year

107
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:53,530
five years ago a report indicated that

108
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,440
four or five companies Wells Fargo Bank

109
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,409
of America Citibank and JP Morgan Chase

110
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,860
these four companies put together

111
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,380
invested 1.5 billion dollars in

112
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,650
mitigating emerging and persisting cyber

113
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,510
threats imagine just four companies on

114
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,590
1.5 billion dollars of investment in

115
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,229
cybersecurity wonder who was a

116
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,140
consultant so that you could find out

117
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:20,650
okay so I think enough of enough of

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,820
reading of data from my side however I

119
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,400
would like to now kick-start the

120
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,219
discussion you know some some really

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,250
blatant opening thoughts from all of you

122
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:32,469
starting with you Burgess as to how how

123
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,750
do you evaluate the human factor in

124
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:37,810
cyber security and where are the weak

125
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,090
links where is the lacunae sure Thanks

126
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,330
so when you said five years ago I saw

127
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,419
you man fine alkanes ago yeah five

128
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,370
Malkin's ago on that note I think when

129
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,349
we say human factor for security most of

130
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,219
us look at plain simple learning

131
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:56,830
awareness but I would serve rephrase

132
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:59,830
that more than learning in awareness I

133
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,870
think it's the attitude of that security

134
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,050
guy which counts you know if he's a

135
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,750
headhunter does he really like to hunt

136
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,080
between the eyes if he's a red team or

137
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,669
does he really have the kill to get that

138
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,130
work done between which most others are

139
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:17,979
not fine or easy happy to settle for the

140
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,469
easiest one if he's a defender you know

141
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,870
will he really be able to safeguard his

142
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:25,389
whole estate behind in spite of knowing

143
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,330
that there are hundred holes so more

144
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,880
than learning an awareness for me the

145
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,490
most most important part of the human

146
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,950
factor for a cyber researcher or the

147
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,099
people in the audience is your attitude

148
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,599
towards security you really want to hunt

149
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,719
between the eyes you want to really make

150
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,570
an impact or are you just no care and

151
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:48,400
awareness is good and life will go on

152
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,260
that's my opening lines so wonderful

153
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,929
point that your attitude towards

154
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,090
security will decide how how robust the

155
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,560
cyber security plan quad will they or

156
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,969
seesaw survives the job or not that's

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,770
the next discussion yeah because you

158
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,409
know either they are responsible how

159
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,440
many of you work in corporates here show

160
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:07,510
fans oh my god lot of them so you're

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,909
CSIS job depends on depends on how you

162
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,520
perform in the organization and how well

163
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:14,289
was I saw you know pressure how well

164
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,229
versed are you with the dust with the

165
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,150
you know the errors that humans create

166
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,340
so I will I will quickly move on to

167
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,289
forum you know your initial comments on

168
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,169
on what we are discussing today and as

169
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:28,180
we move to specific questions sure

170
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:32,199
you know I think just on the thought and

171
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,240
uh just on the line with that the number

172
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,579
is that you put together on the number

173
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,250
of breaches and and how humans are the

174
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:41,409
weakest link it is important to

175
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,789
understand how we function and we

176
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,589
haven't you know as a discipline

177
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,110
invested in a pin and truly understand

178
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:49,389
for example this corona outbreak that is

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,459
going on there's been incredible number

180
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,949
of advisories every single doctor

181
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,229
everybody who's worth their money has

182
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:59,290
said do not wear masks unless you are

183
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,240
sick and in just in this room don't we

184
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,000
see so many people doing exactly what

185
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,980
will actually lead you to be getting

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,720
sick if you are not already sick because

187
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,329
now you can attach your face that many

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,010
times you're gonna try and remove it put

189
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,189
it somewhere and then put it back on

190
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,709
your face so the idea is that you know

191
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,160
it's very important to understand why we

192
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:23,170
do what we do and then find from a

193
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,089
corporate perspective ways in which how

194
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,490
we can incentivize the right kind of

195
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,589
behavior or decentralize that kind of

196
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,180
behavior so from a PayPal perspective

197
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,579
again you know we don't think of all

198
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,260
humans is the same or only thinking of

199
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:38,019
the employees and not thinking of the

200
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,569
developers I broadly I think segment

201
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,790
humans into three categories one is our

202
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,070
customers everybody who is outside and

203
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,019
we think of them as our customers and

204
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,329
what is it that they want to do some of

205
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,610
it some of them are probably in this

206
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,829
room and some of them are attackers some

207
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,980
of them are users but how can we make

208
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:58,719
sure that the good behavior is

209
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,730
incentivize and bad is not the second of

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,470
the builders and what do we do to make

211
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,269
sure the products that we create are the

212
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,459
right kind of products and third are the

213
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,620
operators or the user and as we go

214
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,859
through the the links I'll you know say

215
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,430
how one particular approach may work

216
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,290
really well for a one segment and the it

217
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,510
may not work well for the others but

218
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,579
it's important to not treat everybody in

219
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,939
the same bucket and and the core

220
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:28,750
principle just you know as Berger said

221
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,649
if attitude is in you know as since we

222
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,839
are doing the mindmap

223
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,449
is one area I think from my perspective

224
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,390
the biggest and the most important

225
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,219
considering cyber as a discipline is to

226
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,780
try and keep it as simple as possible so

227
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,820
simply

228
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,160
in this complex world is extremely

229
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,220
important will be thought about human

230
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,540
factors so yeah good two points here

231
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,190
incentivize the right behavior I don't

232
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,020
know how many companies follow this in

233
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,690
in letter and spirit but I haven't I

234
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,520
haven't really seen incentives being

235
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,210
doled out to further for the for the

236
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,680
good behavior however I have seen yeah

237
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,990
deterrence for the for the bad behavior

238
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,949
which is also a good practice however so

239
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,990
sorry for Manisha your opening comments

240
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:18,810
so if you're talking about the human

241
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,450
angle which impacts cybersecurity I mean

242
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,280
let's look at it from two perspectives

243
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,370
99.9% of the people in any organization

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,040
really understand ITT beside IT security

245
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,600
so I think it is more about how to and

246
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,640
no disrespect the fact is it is not

247
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,950
their core business you know they are

248
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,449
they may be tech savvy but they do not

249
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,720
understand the integration in the

250
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:43,070
Integra C's of information technology or

251
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,720
or IT security so I think it's about

252
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,780
simplification it's about very simple

253
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,850
and clear and strong messages it's about

254
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,610
human mind which tends to forget things

255
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,410
a little too frequently so it's also

256
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:58,710
about reminding people at a regular

257
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,510
interval sensitization campaigns should

258
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,240
be run on a regular basis so as to keep

259
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,850
that mind fresh on some of the basic

260
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,310
aspects of cyber security and then I

261
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,220
come to the core element of the actual

262
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:14,219
cyber warriors which you are supposed to

263
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,620
protect the entire organization now with

264
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,540
the current focus on automation you know

265
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,910
there is a lot of belief that look the

266
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,880
human element why is it important in the

267
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,260
Armed Forces we love to say that look

268
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,390
irrespective of what happens for the

269
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,610
foreseeable future we will always be a

270
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,780
man on a woman behind the machine so

271
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,190
there is nothing called hundred-person

272
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,949
automation as well today I'd like to

273
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,260
share this with you in Bharti Airtel we

274
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,450
have currently over a period of one year

275
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,540
with a lot of effort and dedication of

276
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,130
the team 70% of my security operations

277
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,120
right up to incident response is

278
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,310
automated 70 percent okay now going

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,140
forward raising the bar is going to be

280
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,579
very very difficult because you can

281
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,350
reach a benchmark but beyond that

282
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,820
if you have to raise the bar it's a but

283
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,090
we continue to do that but there is a

284
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,910
very very strong team of people you know

285
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,400
working relentlessly the most important

286
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,150
thing for any job and cybersecurity is

287
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
no different

288
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,459
is what is the aptitude of the person

289
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,829
yes all right you may have in fact I

290
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,510
will speak to an ex-colleague

291
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:20,700
this you know just shortly before coming

292
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:23,580
into this room you may want to do you

293
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,700
know something specifically in

294
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,590
cybersecurity but you have to as as an

295
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,360
individual and as a professional really

296
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,730
understand your own strengths and

297
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,770
limitations or what are your strengths

298
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,180
and what I am where where does your

299
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,150
aptitude take you because eventually

300
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,550
that is not just important for your

301
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,290
individual success it's also a very

302
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,939
important contributing factor for the

303
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,829
success of your team and your

304
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,670
organization so I think that aptitude

305
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,500
part is extremely extremely important so

306
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,229
it's just warming up you know I will I

307
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,220
will include people's participation the

308
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,710
people who are listening their

309
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,940
participation also once once we hear

310
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:08,210
from Venkatesh first good morning to all

311
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:11,910
of you so talking about the human factor

312
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:14,880
usually we say that the human or the

313
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,819
employee is the weakest link in the

314
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,960
organization but if we kind of put it in

315
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,970
a more positive self fashion I would say

316
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,790
that you know the employee can actually

317
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,790
be the greatest strength like now that

318
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,740
you have so I would say that you know

319
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,730
from a human factor it is true I mean

320
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,310
like in a statistics do indicate that

321
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,740
25% like a know of incidents are purely

322
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,069
just because of some employee like

323
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,160
actually making an error right I mean an

324
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:51,420
employee clicking on a link etc so I

325
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:56,339
would say that the two aspects that we

326
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:59,819
as caesars need to focus on is C and we

327
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:02,700
use this word awareness very often but I

328
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,339
would say that you know if we if we look

329
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,760
at training main training people

330
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,350
to be self-reliant and to be able to

331
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,950
different the organization so I would

332
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,950
say for the employees one aspect I would

333
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,740
emphasize is the amount of training that

334
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:23,220
you can keep on a repeated fashion and

335
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,930
when I and I mean training where I would

336
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,930
like us to be a little different is that

337
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,638
you know people every all people have

338
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,138
got their jobs right so you are trying

339
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,149
to do an awareness campaign you're

340
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,589
trying to send a newsletter nobody is

341
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,810
going to look at that because they all

342
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:39,000
have their day jobs so if you can make

343
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,099
that training a little bit more

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,510
interesting like through some form of

345
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,120
gamification etc and actually make sure

346
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,040
like you know that that key message that

347
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,510
this what they should and they should

348
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,149
not do if that is kind of deeply imbibed

349
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:59,490
in them that'll be a great win for you

350
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,870
so training is one aspect and the other

351
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,540
is like you know what some of my other

352
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,430
panelists also spoke is the culture so

353
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,399
the culture is a little different from

354
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,140
training where in like you know is - it

355
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,649
should actually be kind of a second

356
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:16,350
nature so I mean how do we actually make

357
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:18,930
sure that you know we reward like in our

358
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,930
cases of good behavior like an of

359
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:25,050
reporting of incidents of cases like

360
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,599
that and also in cases like Ana where

361
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,199
people are actually trying to hide right

362
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,980
either deliberately or like you know

363
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:37,380
through a lapse in judgment we have to

364
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,199
actually start taking actions so what we

365
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,570
do not do well today is we just run

366
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,569
these campaigns but there is no

367
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:49,319
consequence of that so as long as we can

368
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,940
build a consequence mechanism and then

369
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:53,819
make that as a part of like another

370
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,699
culture I think we will go a long way in

371
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,079
making at least that employee aspect

372
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,060
like and which is considered to be the

373
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,800
weakest link that will become like you

374
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,438
know our greatest strength for the

375
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,959
organization yeah so you know great

376
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,169
great two points coming here from from

377
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,650
what when Katie said is the culture of

378
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:16,709
the organization needs to be very very

379
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,220
carefully carefully pursued by the

380
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,449
management and

381
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,860
collected in the in the larger ecosystem

382
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,449
also about the training aspect I will

383
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,918
come to that I have a small I have a

384
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,740
small challenge on the training aspect

385
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,320
whether training is the only thing that

386
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,940
that we can provide to humans or we can

387
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,580
cultivate them in some other ways as

388
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,789
well so Burgess you know very

389
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,620
interesting point that I have captured

390
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,480
from the research unfortunately I

391
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,870
couldn't share it with you is that

392
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:50,200
purpose the researchers and human

393
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:52,989
factors experts vehemently emphasize

394
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,210
that technology alone will not

395
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:59,970
ameliorate information security big fat

396
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,059
there for organizations need to leverage

397
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,130
behavioral specialists to examine cyber

398
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:08,770
security operations from cognitive and

399
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,200
bias viewpoints now my question to you

400
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,690
is not this this was a preface to my

401
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,830
question the question is that you know

402
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:21,789
what goes in the in the mind of an in

403
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:25,990
rogue insider or what goes in the mind

404
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:29,408
of a unethical hacker which which is

405
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,570
which is driving him to you know exploit

406
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:34,210
the vulnerabilities which is driving him

407
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,700
to do bad stuff making him a bad bad

408
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,929
actor all right I'll answer question in

409
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,230
two ways and thanks for not letting me

410
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,919
know before I think humans have evolved

411
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,320
from the Stone Age

412
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,820
you said Tech is not important in that

413
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,240
in the stories that take was a hammer

414
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:53,139
and a chisel to rate sophisticated right

415
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,909
they evolved they have adapted okay the

416
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,860
reason is because the human mind is able

417
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,750
to sort of you know keep on withstanding

418
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,178
a challenge and succumb to that that's

419
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,669
woman defenders perspectives now an

420
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:06,070
attacker or an ethical hacker whatever

421
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:06,789
we call it always looks at the element

422
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,570
of surprise

423
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:12,580
yes for him it is of doing something

424
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,799
what is not expected it is of being

425
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:19,629
where you're not sort of planned to be

426
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,879
and if he has to make an impact on what

427
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,250
he has to prove himself for what I was

428
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,750
trying to do he has to capture that

429
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:31,660
element of unknowing knowing or be where

430
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,610
you are not expected to be

431
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,740
we're normal defenders will not be able

432
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,050
to utilize his adaptability or

433
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,810
versatility to say okay this guy is a

434
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,990
pattern try and be as different as low

435
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,060
as challenging enough so that the

436
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,490
defenses and that's what I really must

437
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,320
do a red teamers also the same thing

438
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,420
they will try and emulate the best

439
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,820
attacker to think the best thing or the

440
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,580
worst thing G will do so that you bring

441
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,889
your worst we'll do our best and that's

442
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,510
the same game whether you train your red

443
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,790
team on to think like that and protect

444
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,070
the company or a bad guy as you said

445
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,020
does that but the thinking process is

446
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,330
same the attackers advantage ram

447
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,710
children's book what is the attackers

448
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,840
advantage that you can give on the

449
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,470
defenses that he or she has not thought

450
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,720
us attacking on our 25th Christmas Day

451
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,060
know stuff like that so extending this

452
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,560
the same question to you forearm and you

453
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,179
know the behavioral part of it though

454
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,980
that the fear of unknown is that the

455
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,710
maximum fear of unknown originates from

456
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,170
the unknown behavioral aspect of human

457
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,240
beings you know and those human beings

458
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,230
you can bucket in all the three aspects

459
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,890
that you talked about the three

460
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,290
stakeholders which are humans so how to

461
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,230
deal with this nuance of behavioral

462
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,990
changes and how how that that one corner

463
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,780
of mine impacts at that point and

464
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,500
triggers the triggers the attack or

465
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:59,139
triggers anything mollified so I'll give

466
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,180
you know maybe touch to try and keep

467
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,840
some time left with the other panelists

468
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:07,480
with very easily I mean a lot of you who

469
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,550
are application security researchers we

470
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,260
were for consistently four quarters

471
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,659
after quarter you know one of the most

472
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,610
attacked website in the world even

473
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,410
though we've been around for twenty

474
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,649
years the kind of the nature the

475
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,960
business that we do makes requires us to

476
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,660
stay online and requires us to be secure

477
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,960
at all times and we were getting you

478
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,060
know on one hand we were acquiring a lot

479
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,310
of companies so our internet footprint

480
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,550
was growing so we started this bug

481
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,870
bounty program about eight years ago

482
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,730
right initially it was very

483
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,250
counterintuitive not only are we not

484
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,030
going to stop people from coming after

485
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,060
us we are going to

486
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:49,629
to actually reward them to poke holes at

487
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,280
our web sites and you know again now a

488
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,470
lot of you probably participate I mean

489
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,090
every year we pay anywhere between two

490
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,370
to three million dollars and a large

491
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,010
majority of it I'm proud to say our

492
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,820
researchers that come from India but it

493
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,680
is yeah it's really commendable to how

494
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,590
the space has grown that's when I'll go

495
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,870
into the world exactly so you know

496
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,270
that's a very good example of how not

497
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,129
only you know trying to create an

498
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,810
opportunity in a way that people can

499
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,270
learn something and apply the skills in

500
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,860
a more responsible manner and and inform

501
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,470
the organization so that it's not just

502
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,570
for lulz it's not just for some kind of

503
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,610
a street cred but it's actually going to

504
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,950
help the organization do what we want to

505
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:33,639
do help you what you wanna do in a

506
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,410
matter of fashion tourniquet anyhow you

507
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,570
know from a pure corporate website

508
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,260
corporate network security perspective

509
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,120
so coincidentally human element was also

510
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,370
the team at RSA and predominantly

511
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,469
everybody was talking about insider

512
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,770
threat you know for a company that is

513
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:53,220
you know available in 200 markets with

514
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,690
56 actual offices around the world

515
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,240
insider threat becomes a big issue when

516
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,670
we have to do businesses in in Russia

517
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,860
and China and Iran in a lot of other

518
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,440
countries where ever you know the

519
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,209
sanctions allow us to do certain things

520
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,950
Mountains the u n-- human viruses is

521
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,160
that the countries you mentioned matches

522
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,910
that true so what we've done is you know

523
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,670
look at the poor aspect of what decides

524
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:21,550
behavior within it within an enterprise

525
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:23,800
and we've come to two key elements one

526
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,350
is the identity identity of a user

527
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,500
identity of a device identity of a

528
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,320
system component whatever it is the

529
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,600
other is the system itself and I did and

530
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,060
create a baseline behavior so if you are

531
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,219
a developer at what time you come what

532
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,320
type of access you have what type of

533
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,900
commands you execute what type of code

534
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,600
you upload and over time we create a

535
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,550
profile at not only at an individual

536
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,770
user level but at a country level at the

537
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,750
city level at a function level same

538
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,760
thing for a system if it is a end user

539
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,350
device it's going to have a baseline of

540
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,840
stat sorts and to care

541
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:01,928
any time we see an anomalous behavior

542
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,209
from that aspect from an insider aspect

543
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:05,830
on a baseline behavior that is already

544
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,470
established it's going to be

545
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,049
investigated and we find ways of how do

546
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,269
you make sure whether it is a suspicious

547
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:15,820
one you know quarantine them for some

548
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,620
time or or outright block them and then

549
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,200
investigate further so if you study

550
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,449
history the people the human element

551
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,649
right it's not the people who have been

552
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,360
strongest who survive

553
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:27,879
now most of the shiquan central pole

554
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,029
right 23 armies try to attack it would

555
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,820
not but the one army who could is the

556
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,409
one was the most versatile just like a

557
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,668
coconut tree you know the strong trees

558
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:39,250
get up put it in a monsoon but the

559
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:40,990
coconut free space is flexible so just

560
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,000
being rigid on a security is not the

561
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,070
only way but being adaptable being

562
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,379
learning being situationally aware and

563
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,178
on-the-fly making your defenses Summoner

564
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:51,070
from attack expect no interesting but

565
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,409
this versatility comes from where you

566
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,600
know who is the who who's the igniting

567
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,639
force that you know we we should become

568
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,189
for ceaseless job to create this as his

569
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:02,439
host job culture okay I mean not his

570
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,769
only job I chose the management but he

571
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,480
has been the driving force for me I I

572
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,559
have a very specific question for you

573
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,970
you you mentioned that you have

574
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:16,690
automated 70% of the incident response

575
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,799
within within your organization now you

576
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,929
know when I hope I can you say

577
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,320
correction correction it's not 70% of

578
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:24,639
incident response I'm saying 70%

579
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,769
security what significant relation on

580
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:31,389
seeking operations are automated okay

581
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:35,350
now so I wrecked myself here however you

582
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:38,229
know even after even after deployment of

583
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:41,289
automated countermeasures malicious

584
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,360
actor gain actors they gain access to

585
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,110
targeted systems by by exploiting the

586
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,389
human error

587
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:49,508
human error remains still remains there

588
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:51,158
completely agree ah so you know whether

589
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:53,100
it is fear phishing whether it is social

590
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,809
engineering whether it is malware attack

591
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,639
non-compliance poor policies anything

592
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,500
you know so how do you deal with that

593
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:02,350
how do you how do you ensure that you

594
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,799
know even after 70% of automation you

595
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:08,590
know this human factor is still

596
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,090
prevalent let me say this that when I

597
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,779
talked about 70 percent

598
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,730
70% of its this the what goes into the

599
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,110
core of security operations and that's

600
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:19,870
more to do with automation around the

601
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,750
same part but on a scale of zero to ten

602
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,239
if you were to ask me that how much

603
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,970
percentage of that would take care of

604
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,740
the entire landscape for IT security and

605
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,809
threat management internal or external

606
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,640
in a company like it and I would say

607
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,529
it's less than one person so that

608
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,380
seventy person was a you know so let me

609
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:41,200
just explain that now coming back to

610
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,149
your core question guys insider threat

611
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,250
continues to remain one of the most most

612
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:51,250
you know vulnerable pain points and it

613
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:54,419
could be on account of two reasons one

614
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:58,330
is a an employee making a mistake is

615
00:26:54,419 --> 00:27:00,190
probably as dangerous an employee in a

616
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,428
in a critical function now just imagine

617
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,380
if they have done something on the

618
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,120
production environment because you have

619
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,320
to cross people there are people who are

620
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
working their production environments

621
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,649
and if they have done something in the

622
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,370
production environment and God forbid

623
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,750
you know it's it leaves gaps or at

624
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,299
leaves holes or a vulnerability in the

625
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,760
ecosystem and that itself is a potential

626
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:23,830
for disaster or somebody makes some

627
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,658
critical changes fine you will detect it

628
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,039
but by the time you detect it it would

629
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,500
have already caused a disruption in your

630
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,440
business continuity then the other

631
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,659
category of insider threat would be

632
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,179
disgruntled employees let's not forget

633
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:40,149
that and of course those with the

634
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:41,919
intention of going wrong for the purpose

635
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,809
of some sort of gratification which

636
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,029
could be or-or-or

637
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,590
that's the disgruntled part and the

638
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:52,090
second is where somebody wishes to you

639
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:55,270
basically defraud that insider I would

640
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,070
rather put on the fraud you know in the

641
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:59,110
category of fraud and any large

642
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,779
organization any large organization any

643
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,709
company has to be alert to the

644
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:09,399
possibility of fraud and data theft IPR

645
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:12,730
so some some employee walks away with

646
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,408
the important idea that itself is matter

647
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,020
of concern so the first and foremost

648
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:18,610
thing is that look and since we are

649
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,000
talking about the human factor let me

650
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,360
bring it to that is that when

651
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,640
organizations find a

652
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,280
problem find an incident detected

653
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,140
insulin they are able to pinpoint the

654
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,510
responsibility for the incident how many

655
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,580
ins how many organizations actually take

656
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,110
strict action so when I say strict

657
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,750
action means everybody wants to sort of

658
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:41,149
you know hush it up push it under the

659
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,400
carpet give a very silent exit because

660
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,049
they think it's bad for the I think it's

661
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,460
about setting the right example if there

662
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,410
is somebody who's done something wrong

663
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,500
it's extremely important that that

664
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,750
person be penalized and a clear message

665
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,410
goes through the through the others that

666
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,850
look this is what happens when you know

667
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,590
you do wrong and meet a very strict

668
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,178
actions we have a zero-tolerance policy

669
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,699
right now so can I just to interrupt you

670
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:07,309
okay the camouflage this information the

671
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,870
way you want it but can you can you then

672
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:11,600
tell some incident which has happened

673
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:14,870
and which is related to the human human

674
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,000
errors as I said I you know any large

675
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,600
organizations will always have incidents

676
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,470
of fraud

677
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,219
so proactively what is it that you do

678
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:28,850
you one is where you reactively look at

679
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:31,850
incidents and see okay if this is a case

680
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,379
of fraud how do I and we have never

681
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,260
noticed this earlier because human minds

682
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,030
are very very you know intelligent that

683
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,490
way they figure out how do we get things

684
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,620
done so you figure out and create a use

685
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,480
case out of it see how you can

686
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,209
strengthen your systems your information

687
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,250
systems to either pretend prevent or

688
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,110
detect something like this happening in

689
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,900
future so that you can immediately catch

690
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,600
it and arrested the so that is more

691
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,460
reactive but the proactive part is that

692
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,350
you always have to have a dedicated team

693
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,030
how many organizations and I am NOT

694
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,230
talking at the large a small ones even

695
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,299
large organizations

696
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,880
how many large organizations actually

697
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:09,350
have a dedicated team working on fraud

698
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,360
management I'm not talking the banks

699
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,939
yeah right I am NOT talking about

700
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,678
business fraud I am talking about

701
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,650
managing fraud through application of

702
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,559
ITC IT and IT security controls so

703
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,480
within the IT team where because today

704
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,610
most of the organizations are roughly

705
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,919
driven by IT systems their life depends

706
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,719
upon it and that's where lots of cause

707
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,460
actually happens that's a dedicated

708
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,290
effort that is needed you talked about

709
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,869
an example yes I can go back in history

710
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,850
somewhere in 2004-2005

711
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:41,820
I'm sure everybody knows what the Armed

712
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:44,369
Forces of the country are we had had a

713
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,928
case of some sensitive data leaking from

714
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:50,639
the headquarters and you know that's a

715
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,499
very long story I don't want to go into

716
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:55,229
it but the fact of the matter was there

717
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:59,159
were be controls there was a motive the

718
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,470
motive was financial benefit okay so one

719
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,289
is where you take action which sends a

720
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:06,960
clear message second is where you make

721
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:09,179
it economically unviable for anybody

722
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,159
internal or external to do what they

723
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,909
want to do with the Valentine purpose

724
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:17,220
and the third is you know have better ID

725
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:22,830
security controls sure I also know what

726
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:25,799
happened to that you know point that you

727
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:29,850
have brought out is important that human

728
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:32,549
factors should include a thorough study

729
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:34,439
of human who you know human interactions

730
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:35,730
with information systems human

731
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,049
interaction with networks human

732
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,289
interaction with practices in

733
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:42,899
information security environment so as

734
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:44,489
you said training so it's simple plane

735
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:51,508
training enough do you think that is

736
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:53,669
that works I don't think that works so

737
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:57,629
yep just training itself like a node

738
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:59,309
would not work but see I mentioned two

739
00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:01,678
things right one is like in a training

740
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,289
and then the other is that culture so

741
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,330
it's it's extremely critical I mean that

742
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:09,230
you know for organizations at least from

743
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:12,809
a human factor perspective the entire

744
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:17,999
the culture of security is actually top

745
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:20,940
down so for example if if the CEO of

746
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:23,639
your organization is not like you know

747
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,619
he's going to be subject to similar

748
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:27,689
standards as you are going to subject

749
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,820
like a node to other people for example

750
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:32,279
I'll give you an example when I conduct

751
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,470
my fishing campaigns I also send it to

752
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,570
the CEO of the company I send it to the

753
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,919
board also because they asked me in the

754
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,899
board meetings right I mean like know

755
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,519
what is your person change etc she's

756
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,840
also got to let them know me like an are

757
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,210
they also clicking on the same link

758
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,759
right and we also tend to target it like

759
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,610
a spearfishing kind of a campaigns so

760
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,500
there seems

761
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,870
standards should be applicable like an

762
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,570
ode to our top management and why I'm

763
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,239
mentioning this culture is if it is top

764
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:00,340
down then like you know it seeps down

765
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,410
like an ode to the other people in the

766
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,928
company and then they would be able to

767
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:08,020
take care of a lot of these things so if

768
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:10,000
it is not for example if if your CEO is

769
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,910
not subject to the same controls and if

770
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,679
he's not going to be security savvy I

771
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,240
mean how can I ask like you know my

772
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,130
JUnit people like in a [ __ ] like you

773
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,429
know handling sensitive information how

774
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:24,549
can I ask them so as far as possible you

775
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,530
as a CEO have to also have those

776
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,840
one-on-one conversations like you know

777
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,549
with your senior management so that they

778
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,168
are aware like you know that unless

779
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:38,410
they'd themselves show that behavior and

780
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:41,080
then he can confidently even go like you

781
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,460
know in a town hall and tell the other

782
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,770
people like you know that this is like

783
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,419
you know is expected of them that'll go

784
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,780
a long way like you know in improving

785
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,419
that

786
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,220
so not just training I mean as such but

787
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:53,559
training should be very important so

788
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,049
training is still I would say multiple

789
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,940
rounds of reinforcements like you know

790
00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:00,100
for people like you know I think that's

791
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,720
non-negotiable people and that's why I

792
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,309
said that you know all these different

793
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,290
kinds of like a good and different

794
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:07,870
manners if you've got something like a

795
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:10,659
Facebook at workplace make it fun make

796
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,759
it entertaining do gamification but at

797
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,649
the end of the day they have to realize

798
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,929
and I said technology also you have to

799
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:19,239
help them for example we all mentioned

800
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,159
about phishing emails right so phishing

801
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:23,138
emails like you know usually who it

802
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,090
comes from right if somebody says the

803
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:28,210
CEO has send a mail like a note to the

804
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:30,639
the finance CFO like you're not asking

805
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,100
for a payment right but if the if the if

806
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,440
the if the email is coming in from

807
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,960
outside the organization at least from a

808
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,490
technology perspective you can put like

809
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,530
you know a header like in a which is

810
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,600
like a saying external or something like

811
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,070
that which can alert people rather than

812
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,139
expecting them to look through all

813
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:49,090
aspects it's from a technology

814
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,609
perspective you try to make it easier

815
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,830
for them and then you educate them that

816
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:56,770
you know use this basis like now use

817
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,690
these as cues like in order to not to

818
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,120
exhibit like you know those behavior so

819
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:04,300
it's a combination so I would say that

820
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,450
does go along with and and lasting rahul

821
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,640
also I mean let's not also over engineer

822
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,060
these things like behavior aspects right

823
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,680
so the thing is sometimes severe all

824
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,500
organizations of different sizes write a

825
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,399
very large organization may have like

826
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,990
you know the kind of resources and

827
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,810
lichen or to kind of invest like you

828
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,089
know in behavior specialists etc but

829
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,670
that normal organization is not going to

830
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,610
have that so it is your responsibility

831
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:36,100
of the Caesar to continuously keep

832
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:38,020
driving that awareness or training down

833
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,839
on a regular it's necessary but not

834
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:43,090
sufficient and something is like a cyber

835
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,680
war gaming which you know if you if you

836
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,910
read something you know more 10% if you

837
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,160
write twenty percent but if you

838
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,140
experience something and experiential

839
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,960
learning makes you remember and behavior

840
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,450
soap behavior to habit to sort of just

841
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,670
be is part of culture okay I'm I'm

gentlemen my name is Brian Pereira I'm

848
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,350
the editor of seaso magazine which is

849
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,910
produced by ec-council one of the

850
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,000
discussions I have with internationally

851
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,690
source is the challenge of communicating

852
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,670
security to the board

853
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,340
I know bank it is just touched upon that

854
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:30,100
and it's especially a challenge to get

855
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,840
you know but to increase your budgets on

856
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,910
board and the board really takes things

857
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,800
seriously when you heard here of an

858
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,779
attack like Capital One and so on then

859
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,370
they start asking questions what is your

860
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,610
strategy for communicating cyber

861
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:44,319
security to the board and I'm told that

862
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,270
some of them don't even understand some

863
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,580
of the technical terms yeah

864
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,259
so answer this is the question on the

865
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,270
two o clock discussion so please okay

866
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,250
I'll come back for that until X yes in

867
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:57,670
the next one you just jump the question

868
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,230
of the two o'clock so I just I just try

869
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,170
to put it in a very brief contact it's a

870
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,780
very good question and yes it's a see

871
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:09,010
resources are always limited you will

872
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:12,280
always always have to you know pitch for

873
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,289
those limited resources and part of the

874
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,049
job of a seesaw is how to use how

875
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:19,900
you sell internally and let me not dwell

876
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:22,719
too much on the word sell it's about how

877
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,449
do you take what is in the interest of

878
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,279
the organization and convince the the

879
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:29,169
decision makers who control the purses

880
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:31,779
to give you what you want so that you

881
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:35,949
can secure the organization I think the

882
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:38,380
most important thing is that you seek

883
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:40,779
alignments with business you also do an

884
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,999
impact assessment saying that look this

885
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:44,979
is where we are this is how we could get

886
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:47,529
impacted and this could be the possible

887
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:49,209
negative impact if we don't do this this

888
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:50,640
this and this and this is sort of

889
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:53,410
proactively at a very high level

890
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,489
educating the decision makers that look

891
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:59,459
there is a potential risk of you know a

892
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:02,199
huge amount of business disruption

893
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:04,689
negative impact to brand and possible

894
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,239
loss of revenue if at least certain

895
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:08,469
actions basic security controls and

896
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:10,859
technologies are not put into place

897
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:12,969
money so while you write is negative a

898
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:15,189
modern way of looking is the positive

899
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:16,329
part if you put better security does it

900
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:17,919
mean more business it's just not

901
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:19,539
negative saying if you don't do this

902
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:21,129
happens wrong but if you do good

903
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:22,959
security from right this is a bit of

904
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,400
power so you try the first part if that

905
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,779
doesn't work and try the second dish

906
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,119
comes first I'll do two again

907
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:31,359
okay any other questions here yes I

908
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,189
heard a lot of hands I have yeah so I

909
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,299
will I will curtail my questions now I

910
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:39,328
think I just wanted to I mean I hope the

911
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:41,799
audience thought like you know

912
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:45,489
Burgess point I think that's extremely

913
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:49,359
important for the modern C so we have

914
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:52,269
always been thinking security more as a

915
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,390
defensive shield I think we have to get

916
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:59,229
out of it and start thinking security

917
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:02,169
more as as a growth driver as a as a

918
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:04,899
competitive advantage and that's how you

919
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:07,029
communicate to the poor and in a lot of

920
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:10,179
our discussions I mean I mean if we can

921
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:11,709
even take this offline like and also but

922
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:14,499
but you you gotta have those

923
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:16,479
conversations where your partner's for

924
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:18,908
example in case of : like Anna we do

925
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:21,669
business like no with top companies like

926
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:24,219
Nestle Mondelez etc I mean like Anna do

927
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:26,558
they have confidence in you so a lot of

928
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:26,860
that business like is driven out of like

929
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,540
you know

930
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,660
are you able to protect like another

931
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,460
information I actually started the

932
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,500
saying you have to align with business

933
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,180
so your conversations you have to find

934
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,040
alignment with business if you are not

935
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,310
aligned with business then you're not

936
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,230
aligned with the company Mike there

937
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:47,140
please my name is Jake amar I work for

938
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,150
Asha security so I accept the point when

939
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,609
today she said so the training is

940
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,770
important we conduct trainings yearly

941
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,640
twice or thrice also we live it in the

942
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:59,350
name of strike training we have seen the

943
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,480
percentage of people clicking on spear

944
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,490
phishing or phishing emails a lesser but

945
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,100
sometimes we are seen people who click

946
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,589
on like people who hook on cyber

947
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,380
security of example a soccer team so

948
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:13,540
people work on soft team itself fall for

949
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,000
phishing attacks so they don't have a

950
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,970
proper mindset so one of the thing is

951
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,130
like I work with Burgas in Bangladesh in

952
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,810
a project so we set up a sock there and

953
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:26,440
we are training people to work on the

954
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:29,440
sock and they know how to do an alert or

955
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,540
they know how to send an alert to the

956
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,090
customer but they don't have a proper

957
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,700
mindset if they see a different scenario

958
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:39,010
or different type of attack or something

959
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,839
so I have seen in multiple socks they

960
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,730
don't have a proper mindset from the

961
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,980
beginning they just know how to look at

962
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,660
a document fill it and for the employees

963
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,470
I am fine but what about the security

964
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:53,230
people so how do they grow the mindset

965
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:55,240
how can we improve so that's where the

966
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,850
aptitude part comes in and typically

967
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,979
what happens is that if you are

968
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:01,750
selecting in the industry if you're

969
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,750
conducting an interview you're your

970
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,640
shortlisting people for enroll in a tell

971
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,990
we spend a lot of time and effort in

972
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,560
seeing what is the aptitude of the

973
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,759
person so trainability is a factor

974
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,310
alright in psychology it's called

975
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:18,250
trainability factor if a person has the

976
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:20,230
aptitude then you can train him or her

977
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,140
to do a lot more than they currently

978
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,940
know but they could have seven years of

979
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,250
experience and shock but if they don't

980
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,980
have the right aptitude they will never

981
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:33,250
ever reach an l-3 or a level beyond that

982
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:36,070
so that's an exercise that we do in fact

983
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:37,960
the mentor call its students we say

984
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:40,120
listen I know you want to do this but I

985
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,660
think you're more suited for this and

986
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,750
you will have

987
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,399
much better success in future if you

988
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,530
pursue this particular direction so it's

989
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,200
about aptitude and it's always good to

990
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,990
talk to people who are experts in the

991
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,149
field who really understand where and

992
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,640
what is you know what loss suited most

993

997
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,530
it to you just yeah so Burgess is

998

offering consulting after this free of

999
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:14,890
cost so we of course hi good afternoon

1000
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,799
everybody my name is Salma and I work

1001
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:19,720
for the blue team in Microsoft first of

1002
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:22,059
all thank you fall for your dispersion

1003
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,000
it's very interesting and been very

1004
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:26,890
engaging so my question to you guys a

1005
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,280
bug is especially is like you touched

1006
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:32,828
upon looking at between the eyes right

1007
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,839
catching up incidents which you don't

1008
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:37,569
usually catch up from an IOC perspective

1009
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,359
and things like that right so basically

1010
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:42,038
if I talk about an insider touch insider

1011
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:44,319
threat which every all of you touched

1012
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:47,109
upon right there was the attacks like in

1013
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,640
2016 there was a person named Andrew who

1014
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:50,650
work for Google and who took in data

1015
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,109
about three plants for about five months

1016
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,720
and then moved over and use those things

1017
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,160
so as an hunter myself as a blue team

1018
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,288
member how do we look at these things

1019
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,819
because there's so much data coming in

1020
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:03,460
there IOC s we are looking at their

1021
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:05,440
Intel coming in but the ground reality

1022
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,420
is to look at these things to look at

1023
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,069
the behavioral models people logging in

1024
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,950
at one time people logging off is good

1025
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:14,109
but looking at what a person what an

1026
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,788
attacker really wants that will not

1027
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:17,500
really you know ground reality

1028
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:19,240
situations great question I'll answer

1029
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,799
first and a funny note forces join

1030
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,990
consulting you get to express the

1031
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:26,230
multiple times right you are doing hard

1032
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:28,598
selling but I have a loud sorry the

1033
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,059
question is how do you find a blue team

1034
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,250
or to hit between the eyes detect the

1035
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:35,289
attacks I think there's nothing but keep

1036
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:38,440
on wargaming keep on wargaming being

1037
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,630
paranoid keep on doing industries

1038
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,640
different types of attacks keep on doing

1039
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,170
different models right keep on

1040
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,160
challenging and that's a part is for

1041
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,250
bespoke or aptitude

1042
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,288
I for attitude when you have what you

1043
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,920
are successful headhunter as join our

1044
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:55,590
case you want to be or CGI

1045
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,390
but you got to have that kill of knowing

1046
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,140
that I really wanna find all I am doing

1047
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,509
a shock

1048
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,609
watch the watch the voice it are shipped

1049
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,050
and go away or you really want to find

1050
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,880
that because you want it for the

1051
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,680
pleasure you know when a hunter enhance

1052
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,850
he hunts for food or he hunts for

1053
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,720
shooting wood in the eyes and their

1054
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:14,009
hands what type of a poor hunter are you

1055
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,080
that's the difference one more point

1056
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,370
since you're closing the attack since my

1057
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,860
friend mentioned colleague mentioned I

1058
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,600
first financials in the new vector is

1059
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,700
what defenses but no one thought about

1060
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,620
the attacks the attacks are now going

1061
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,859
for the digital life more and more

1062
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:31,170
occurs are going banks telcos are being

1063
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,930
attacked so as comic manufacturing but

1064
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,910
the digital life what we all enjoy this

1065
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,890
is a new sweet spot for attackers the

1066
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,040
human element the topic of the human

1067
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,960
they're so used to the soft cozy

1068
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,400
all-encompassing digital life that is

1069
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,440
where the new attacks are going to be

1070
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,300
the new attack because I want to come

1071
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,940
the only thing I would add is threat

1072
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,130
hunting you cannot be a part-time job it

1073
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,660
yeah in an organization if you're

1074
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,880
serious about it it has to be a

1075
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,529
dedicated job by a dedicated team you

1076
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,380
keep doing this because it is a

1077
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:04,650
cat-and-mouse game last remission was

1078
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,900
just just one last question she let her

1079
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,580
given up on I will I will I will read

1080
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,890
with permission from unfix I will

1081
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,759
certainly get back to you with for the

1082
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,220
last question

1083
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,230
I cannot say last last last and last but

1084
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:21,660
she wears their hand first I will just

1085
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:24,780
get that thank you so much really talked

1086
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:28,049
about awareness training and things like

1087
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:30,690
that but IT our technology currently is

1088
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,370
being used as a tool not as a focus so a

1089
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,650
lot of people employees in various

1090
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:37,259
companies focus on what their job is

1091
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,880
supposed to be not IT especially which

1092
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,400
is used as a tool but what their job is

1093
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,680
supposed to be so and you even mention

1094
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,240
about people being tech savvy but a lot

1095
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,190
of people aren't like that and a lot of

1096
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,560
people want to be important college they

1097
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,810
want knowledge about their job not ITU

1098
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,660
not how to protect themselves that's not

1099
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:58,049
what we all focus on so how do we cross

1100
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,790
from what we earn and how we protect how

1101
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,670
do employers how is it possible for

1102
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:04,650
employees who are earning to know the

1103
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,300
only to get the knowledge about security

1104
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,670
to

1105
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:13,110
so I think the first and foremost thing

1106
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:15,150
is it's not just about pushing people I

1107
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,650
think there is a lot of positivity that

1108
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:19,050
is required in the messaging that goes

1109
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:22,980
out that look guys the world is changing

1110
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:25,010
right and you have to change along with

1111
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,200
the world in order to be better prepared

1112
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:29,550
today if you were to tell a 70 year old

1113
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,740
if a 70 year old

1114
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:37,620
I mean 70 in today's world is not a very

1115
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:42,089
big age spring area anymore

1116
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:44,190
but can you imagine today a person of 65

1117
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,650
to 70 years of age not even being able

1118
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:49,380
to operate a smartphone a laptop

1119
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:50,910
look at the negative impact in life

1120
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,520
there's so many things that they can do

1121
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:55,620
sitting I bought Dom absolutely so I

1122
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,560
think it's about personal transformation

1123
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,540
which means that it is not for an

1124
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,130
individual at least that's how I mentor

1125
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,930
people I'm saying it's not just as an

1126
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,870
individual or it's not just as an

1127
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:09,180
employee that you need to upskill it is

1128
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,380
as an individual for a personal benefit

1129
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,149
that you need to upskill because

1130
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,380
otherwise world will go on and it'll

1131
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,390
leave you behind complete is about

1132
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,950
survival once what the company can do

1133
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,700
but what are you doing to ensure you are

1134
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:22,140
in the market otherwise okay yeah it's

1135
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,390
just fear and just do it up to the point

1136
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,129
I mean like no so while while you have a

1137
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,990
day job right that's what's your point

1138
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,700
right and then you have also have got to

1139
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,770
do security I don't think like you know

1140
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,450
organizations will have to make this

1141
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,880
like you know that security is almost

1142
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,799
like second nature say unless that is

1143
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,420
that onion fits like a different job I

1144
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,280
have to do my day job and then I have to

1145
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,360
do half an hour of training then it

1146
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,520
becomes like you know much more

1147
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,680
difficult that's why I said that the way

1148
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,840
you conduct these awareness sessions is

1149
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,750
like you know something that you really

1150
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,610
want to like you know learn and do along

1151
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,640
with your regular job so that's why a

1152
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:58,110
lot of these war games gamification like

1153
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,089
you know have fun like in our own

1154
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:01,830
security at your workplace then it

1155
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:05,720
becomes second nature then everybody

1156
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:10,590
learns along with the job okay last last

1157
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:12,569
I'm so sorry this is Jackson part of my

1158
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:15,660
previous life I also had to deal a lot

1159
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:17,340
with insider threat and I wanted this is

1160
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,740
not something I come up with and I

1161
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,240
worked with Burgesses oil company

1162
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,490
and we had come up with a mindset it

1163
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,270
said internally what does a person need

1164
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:29,540
to commit fraud or an incident you need

1165
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:33,119
motivation you need opportunity you need

1166
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:35,100
justification I need to be able to be

1167
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,080
able to commit the fraud I need to be

1168
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,240
motivated enough to do it and I need to

1169
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,470
rationalize it back to my friends and

1170
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:45,720
family that why I did what I did as

1171
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,850
Caesars we like to believe that we wear

1172
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,220
a cape around our neck can we wear or

1173
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,860
Underpants over our pants but we are not

1174
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,890
Superman we can do only so much with the

1175
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,990
controls we can reduce that aspect of it

1176
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,089
but the motivation aspect for it the

1177
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,310
seaso has to work with your HR

1178
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:05,430
departments with your functional heads

1179
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:11,130
because if the employee let's say is in

1180
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:13,379
finance and his boss is draconian past

1181
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:15,600
master no matter how many controls you

1182
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,600
put into place his motivation is still

1183
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:21,210
crap and he's basically going to try to

1184
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,730
do something to break the system and if

1185
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:26,310
we can justify it you know because like

1186
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,900
Venkatesh mentioned if you have two sets

1187
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,940
of standards for the management and

1188
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,300
another set for the employees he

1189
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,340
justifies it he says the boss can do it

1190
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,790
why can't I do it why shouldn't I do it

1191
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,710
so it is not enough that and this is my

1192
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:43,560
humble opinion it's not enough as

1193
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:46,050
Caesars that we just employ technology

1194
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,600
to put it we are closing one aspect of a

1195
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,700
three-pronged attack which is the the

1196
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,920
opportunity part of it but there is

1197
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,899
still a lot that we have to work with

1198
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,210
the HR departments and throughout the

1199
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:00,270
rest of the organization otherwise we

1200
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:02,340
leave motivation and justification open

1201
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:04,470
I think well put motivation

1202
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,030
justification opportunity these three go

1203
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:08,490
hand in hand to get the human element I

1204
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,530
think well summarize that I think you

1205
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:16,500
did you simplified my job that's why I

1206
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:18,750
thank you so I think a beautiful mind

1207
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:23,119
map is created here you view you saw the

1208
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:26,340
action and thanks to our friend there he

1209
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,500

1211
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,430

1213

1215
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:40,430
