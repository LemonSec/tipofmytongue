1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,310
hello everyone so my name is Bhaskar I

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,000
will let the panelists introduce

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,370
themselves this panel is really about

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,170
talking about the economics of data

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,679
breaches I think it's an interesting

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,560
topic it's probably deeply technical in

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,698
some sense it's also funny because

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,698
there's a lot of funny stories about

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:31,140
there's a lot of funny stories about

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,110
data breaches that we'll talk about and

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,060
I'm also glad that in this panel we have

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,690
some folks who have had some very close

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,150
encounters with this particular topic so

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,459
towards the end we'll also try and look

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,339
into the crystal ball if you will and

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,230
see if we can make some predictions

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,300
who cares if they come true or not but

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,879
we can still make some predictions so

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,309
without much ado now let me get started

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,370
and why don't each one of you introduce

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,380
yourself and give a little more context

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,039
in terms of your role your organization

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,929
and maybe how how data breach is related

24
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:12,299
to some of your work in the past and

25
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:14,700
we'll get started all right so I'm Yosh

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,159
Kodaka I run a company called security

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,600
Brigade and for the last 13 years or so

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,249
pretty much data breaches are a daily

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,729
part of my life unfortunately because

30
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:25,020
our job is essentially breaking customer

31
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,749
systems bricky customer networks

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,639
platforms and we see evidences of data

33
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:32,548
breaches evidences of compromises pretty

34
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:35,389
much every day of the week so yeah it's

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,340
a very real part of my day-to-day life

36
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:41,609
hi everyone I'm sucuk Mishra I'm

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,100
currently the CIO at Howdy's autonomous

38
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:49,708
driving division in Munich prior to that

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,318
I worked in security at uber grab a lot

40
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,389
of tech companies Adobe Salesforce

41
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,679
primarily in the US and unfortunately or

42
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:57,149
fortunately about the experience of

43
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,799
dealing through breaches had some of

44
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,490
these companies

45
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,490
so hopefully you might find some

46
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,899
inside valuable but afternoon everyone

47
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,460
my name is Manu Zakaria

48
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,610
I run a conference called cocoon as

49
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,959
filled as I run a research of nitrogen

50
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,209
called information security research

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,190
Association apart from that I have my

52
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,920
own company called Hackett so that's my

53
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,560
quick introduction sure thank you so

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,569
much and we also have the world's what

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,730
is ok is hacker so he's definitely

56
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,069
qualified to speak on the topic at least

57
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,010
with the t-shirt right so we'll start

58
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,609
with you then Yash so they say that

59
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,859
there are two types of companies right

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,900
ones that have been hacked and once that

61
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,850
don't know that they have been hacked so

62
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,350
what is your opinion about that is that

63
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:46,209
is that really true I mean of course yes

64
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,790
100% true there's no question about it

65
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:52,420
but I think not just companies anymore

66
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,579
it's individuals as well right so what

67
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,600
we've typically seen as in what we what

68
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,459
I typically see when I interact with

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,280
people as well right it's when you talk

70
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,349
about a data breach it's a very virtual

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,970
concept it's a very far away concept

72
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,290
right and then when you open up the dark

73
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,030
web or you open up whatever talk web

74
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,350
search engine plug in their email

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,730
address and then they see that they were

76
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,829
part of 30 different data breaches in

77
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,440
the last two years right it turns a lot

78
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,090
more real then and even then every

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,410
single time right so I'll be talking a

80
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,630
seesaws I'll be talking to security

81
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,859
heads technical people right and every

82
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,880
single time I pull up the dark web

83
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,470
they're super surprised they're always

84
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,660
shocked that oh my passwords there as

85
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,820
well which is then sort of makes you

86
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,670
question right if you work in security I

87
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,900
usually surprised that you have been

88
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,119
hacked already or you have been

89
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,739
compromised already and that mindset is

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,040
another problem there right people go

91
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,769
with the assumption it's not me it's him

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,290
it probably won't happen to me who who I

93
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,299
know I sell cars or I manufacture or

94
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,250
something who wants access to my data my

95
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,590
information there is no value there it's

96
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,810
typically the mindset you see so a very

97
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,109
real problem that we run into pretty

98
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,680
much every dealer sure sure so I'll move

99
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:01,840
over to switch it with a slightly

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,989
different question now so Jade you have

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,790
obviously been a custodian of some

102
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,859
incredibly valuable brands from a cyber

103
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,799
security perspective right uber and

104
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,720
Flipkart

105
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,640
and it's fair to say that all of this

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,910
organization have optimized for growth

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,500
right and that sometimes comes in the

108
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,790
way of being a little safe safe right so

109
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,280
let's say hypothetically one of these

110
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,720
who have reached right so what three

111
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,239
things would come to your mind as a

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,560
leader of cybersecurity in this organize

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,540
these are the first three things I'm

114
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,340
gonna do as soon as I hear about a

115
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:42,450
breach at uber yeah I think the first

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,219
thing this is again very typical you

117
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,229
know going into a war right you have to

118
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,500
contain the damage for the company right

119
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,780
away I mean many people spend too much

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,820
time thinking hey why did it happen and

121
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,169
what we could have done and all that but

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,330
doesn't matter at that point at that

123
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,310
moment it's about how quickly can I

124
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,820
contain the situation and I quickly can

125
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,560
I respond to my customers to my

126
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,080
stakeholders and and make sure that

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,669
they're aware of what happened and then

128
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,530
how the last thing the third thing would

129
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:13,080
be getting back into business as soon as

130
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,229
possible right because time is money in

131
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,419
this context and and of course the more

132
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,669
this linger some more fear uncertainty

133
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,900
and doubt lingers in the minds of the

134
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:26,880
people your customers your stakeholders

135
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,210
your investors and you want to put them

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,219
at ease saying okay thing happened was a

137
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,169
mistake or whatever that may be but we

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,700
have it under control I think that is

139
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,310
the message the more you panic the more

140
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,200
things get worse so the most important

141
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,080
thing I have learned in all this is

142
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,700
always you have to stay calm and not

143
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,580
blow it out of proportions and not and

144
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,030
the last thing is not to blame your

145
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,469
peers in the room saying you know I D

146
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,849
you guys hooked up I've been telling you

147
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,140
this for the last five years and you did

148
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,450
not listen to me and look what happened

149
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,159
that's the last thing you want to do

150
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,830
when you're in the room with these

151
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,300
people you say we're all in it we'll get

152
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,130
through this right then later on you can

153
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,690
do the root cause analysis and and and

154
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,010
and figure out what's what you would

155
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,180
have done better right and then there

156
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,219
was a teaching moment or a learning

157
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,660
moment yeah I mean just to add to that

158
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,400
right if you've gotten to the point of

159
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,010
breach without that plan already in

160
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,929
place you failed in multiple right so

161
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,250
you should already have that what am I

162
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,060
going to do when everything burns down

163
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,820
plan written put down doc you

164
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,320
to rehearse on a boardroom level on a

165
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,599
technical level on an operational level

166
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,980
already have that in place so it's very

167
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,930
hard to think through all the things

168
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,580
that would happen at uber right we're

169
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,560
running a bug bounty program nobody had

170
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,140
thought that a bug bounty hunter would

171
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,840
go rogue or whatever right we that was

172
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,210
taken too far in that context right we

173
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,789
all believe that there is a

174
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,580
responsibility and people will stay

175
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,500
within that contract right but you

176
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,820
cannot anticipate all the scenarios and

177
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,960
there's going to be this last-minute but

178
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,000
the more prepared you are the better of

179
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,530
course this is actually a really

180
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,020
interesting point because a little bit

181
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,270
going off but this is a this is a

182
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,430
problem I've seen at multiple places

183
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,710
when your theater is worth so much more

184
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,690
than the bounty or offering how do you

185
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,130
prevent that guy from just being you

186
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,560
know what maybe I'm just gonna go to the

187
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,240
dark web put this data see how much

188
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,500
money I can get as opposed to go get the

189
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,350
swag or the thousand dollars or whatever

190
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,150
the corporate is giving out to me and

191
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,230
that's always going to be a tempting

192
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,669
challenge when it comes to because the

193
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,040
value of datas is growing exponentially

194
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,780
right that single breach at about

195
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,190
probably worth a tremendous amount of

196
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,690
money versus whatever the bounty was

197
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,950
offering so that's always the challenge

198
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,140
we're gonna have with this bug bounty

199
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,150
was that period now but it's interesting

200
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,460
if I may continue okay if you look at

201
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:40,539
Apple now right they're offering a

202
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,330
million dollars for the most glaring

203
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,180
security issue at the remote full no

204
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,919
user access sort of interaction sort of

205
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,360
thing right the reason they are paying a

206
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,720
million dollars is that is what it sells

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,180
in the black market for right so they're

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,070
just evening out the playing field

209
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,900
completely that hey there's no point

210
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,520
where the black market come to me have

211
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,140
to pay the same amount of money so the

212
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,599
incentive is completely changed right

213
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,340
the breach is completely prevented and I

214
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,950
think what I saw I remember right they

215
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,140
were saying in the beta releases we find

216
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,229
something via maybe 50% more right

217
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,830
because a park our data peach prevented

218
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,780
is way more valuable than once it's in

219
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,150
the field right I think so that's the

220
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,559
right incentive if you wanna you know do

221
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,210
the soy type utilization and I'm glad

222
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,400
you bought that angle up because I'm

223
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,950
sure there are a bunch of aspiring

224
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,510
hackers here so we'll talk in a bit if

225
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,100
you want to actually build a hacking

226
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,720
company how to make money so we have

227
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,370
some great tips and how to raise money

228
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,219
we'll talk

229
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,789
that so let me get to Manu for a second

230
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,320
here right so I'm gonna make a statement

231
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,420
maybe it's a provocative one and let's

232
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,000
see get some reactions from you so in my

233
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,069
opinion I think you know data breaches

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,080
have become like potholes right we have

235
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,620
been desensitized to this fact that our

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,870
data is getting rich and if I may be so

237
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,339
bold and say the likes of uber and flip

238
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,640
cards and Amazon gets away with it

239
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,040
because I'm not bothered extensively to

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,540
come out on the street and make a show

241
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,170
about it right oh yeah my data got

242
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,270
breached

243
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,250
so what's your reaction to this do you

244
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,860
think we've been desensitized to data

245
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,870
breaches I always start with the I mean

246
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,250
my perception of security security is

247
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,430
all about being prepared for the

248
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,930
unexpected so you know it's just take

249
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,729
the example of coronavirus we were not

250
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,150
expecting this and certainly it happened

251
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,690
so are we in a position to secure it

252
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:37,439
it's something similar to that yes see

253
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,270
so the second is it's a state of

254
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,300
well-being security is a state of

255
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,279
well-being is how I define it so yes

256
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,680
data breaches are going to happen it is

257
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,839
the amount like what he said it's

258
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,020
exponentially increasing the value of it

259
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,459
now how do we disclose it how do we find

260
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,980
the right balance is the question that

261
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,930
every organization has to speak so we

262
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,450
have to take into consideration the

263
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,729
brand value as well as the liability

264
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,980
towards the end users or the customers

265
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,779
as well as the compliance part from the

266
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,430
legal perspective so somewhere we have

267
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,080
to find a balance between these three

268
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,410
and then take the policy and take it

269
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,230
forward so adding on to that question

270
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,680
right there was a big Sony breach I

271
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,779
don't particularly remember the year and

272
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,140
there are senior Sony leaders on record

273
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:28,290
saying we will not invest 10 million

274
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,930
dollars to save potentially 1 million

275
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,610
dollars right yes so let's have all of

276
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,150
your takes on this particular question

277
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,640
when a senior leader of a exceptionally

278
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,819
well-known brand makes a statement that

279
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,709
I have a potential loss of 1 million but

280
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,270
I have a very real investment of 10

281
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,550
million and I'm going to make it a

282
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,040
business decision so let's start with

283
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,790
mono switch

284
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,589
and Yosh so the very basics of security

285
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,599
we say if you want to protect at entropy

286
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,860
data don't put a 50 rupee firewall for

287
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,000
that yeah you might want to take your

288
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,589
mic a little closer oh yeah yeah yeah so

289
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,720
so the very basics of security that we

290
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:07,730
say is if you have a 10 rupee data don't

291
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,920
put a 50 rupee firewall for it but it's

292
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,680
not just the data it's the brand value

293
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,209
what is the you know the compliance part

294
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,479
like what is the penalty if you don't

295
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:19,699
follow the policies the standards and

296
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,470
all those things so it's not just what

297
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:23,689
you are protecting but the holistic

298
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,279
picture like the bigger picture what is

299
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,630
the future if you don't protect or if

300
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,480
you don't end well it's not just the

301
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:33,259
current it's it's the future also so

302
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,180
that's how I look at it so switch it

303
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,069
what's your take on that will you invest

304
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,699
ten million dollars to potentially

305
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:42,259
protect a million dollars so I haven't

306
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,199
gone through this a couple of times and

307
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,899
and dealing with business right I mean

308
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:49,310
they really think and this is sort of

309
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,709
I'm putting it there versus us or

310
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,750
whatever but it is business at the end

311
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:56,209
of the day it's pure economics right

312
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:59,089
even even a hacker who's spending time

313
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,250
writing the exploit if it is not a warm

314
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,660
apple thing that will fetch him millions

315
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,639
of dollars he's not want to spend six

316
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,199
months working like the phone to on

317
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,470
context right people are spending six

318
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:11,420
nine months creating that experts within

319
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,819
the first hour they can pop the Tesla

320
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,610
and when the Tesla and any not $1,000

321
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:18,829
right so the amount of it is directly

322
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,910
proportional the the ROI it has to be

323
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:25,069
right so so and to your point what has

324
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,630
happened in the industry despite all

325
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:29,060
these target breach happened Sony breach

326
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,980
happened Adobe breach happened the

327
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,888
market has come to the understanding

328
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,050
that this is just the same as accidents

329
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,310
on the road people are going to die and

330
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,410
we today live with the fact that a

331
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,630
million people in the world die on road

332
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,510
accidents it despite having the traffic

333
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,240
lights and safety belts and airbags and

334
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:50,300
everything right so it's sad but it's

335
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,829
true and that's why this whole push to

336
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,258
autonomous vehicles now is that okay

337
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,989
maybe we can save a million lives in a

338
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,880
year

339
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,740
because some people think that is more

340
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,500
valuable and they're spending billions

341
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,630
of dollars now so you can see the

342
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,760
asymmetry but they believe that by

343
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,260
spending billions they will not only get

344
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,050
safety but they make trillions of

345
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,450
dollars correct right which is why the

346
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,399
real investment is happening right so

347
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,810
business is always going to take front

348
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,899
and center no matter what yeah

349
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,279
all right yes so I think it's a it's

350
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,660
also you have to factor in a couple of

351
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,970
different things right the ROI is very

352
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,219
different so one is I give you an

353
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,630
example 15 years ago I go and buy my dad

354
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,089
a laptop I got my Windows laptop at that

355
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,649
point and he starts using it he's using

356
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,600
hotmail and he's got something set up

357
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:36,399
and he starts plugging his information

358
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,779
on every website and every single thing

359
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,940
he can see right and I'm just like that

360
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,200
you better get a billion spam emails

361
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,970
what do you know he's like what does it

362
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,260
matter like what someone gonna do with

363
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,110
my data right what's the what's the

364
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,089
value of your I might get something free

365
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,100
or whatever it was right and you'd go

366
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,390
ahead and do that gain 50 I mean

367
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,709
immediately after that I moved him to a

368
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,010
winter laptop with a Windows key in

369
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:59,260
particular make it mitigate the risk but

370
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,880
10 years later 15 years later today he

371
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,770
gets a billion spam messages on his

372
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,050
phone every single day billion spam

373
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,880
emails every single day and that part of

374
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,199
the problem right is the end users

375
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,930
typically don't care about the data

376
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,240
right I mean every single person here

377
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,069
has that has had their data breach that

378
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,329
at least 30 40 different places in the

379
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,040
last couple of Europe in the last two

380
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:19,569
years right whether it's the Zomato

381
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,860
breach whether it's LinkedIn whether its

382
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,250
Dropbox whether it's whatever else it

383
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,170
works right nobody really cares I mean

384
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,370
no one is going on the road protesting

385
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,899
nobody's really saying I'm going to stop

386
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,100
ordering stuff from Zomato I've got a

387
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:33,760
sweetie now cuz you guys had a breach

388
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,440
I'll take my business away right so the

389
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,300
cost dynamics are changing drastically

390
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,089
as a business if I am so mater for

391
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,439
example I'm gonna think I have to spend

392
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,600
50 million on security

393
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,829
we had a breach and we had a minimal

394
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,779
impact right we spent a couple of

395
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:48,310
thousand dollars on PR her everyone's

396
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,649
forgotten about it now nobody cares the

397
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,089
data's out there what's the value and

398
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:55,060
then you have another twist to the story

399
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,220
right cyber security insurance now a

400
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,689
$500 breach is gonna cost me as a

401
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,000
company 100 thousand dollars in premium

402
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,500
and I can forget about it so the

403
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,480
question is would you rather invest 10

404
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,579
million on security a million in the

405
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,440
breach or 20,000 on cyber security

406
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,670
insurance could sort of forget most of

407
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,160
the

408
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,229
Crale and that dynamic of the user not

409
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,459
carrying and insurers willing to

410
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,600
obviously in short things cheaply

411
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,390
because there's no compliance especially

412
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,970
in Indian context there isn't really a

413
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,170
disclosure law there isn't really a

414
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:25,830
finality mechanism there isn't really a

415
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,180
stick essentially right that they don't

416
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,030
have an incentive to bother spending a

417
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,310
ten million go so if you think about it

418
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,680
right it's very interesting I can bother

419
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,449
each one of these gentlemen here just a

420
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,449
little bit the pothole example and make

421
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,760
a lot of money right so I really want to

422
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,530
actually do a start-up now I think I'm

423
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,300
convinced after talking to you guys and

424
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,880
it's going to be about data breaches

425
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,560
right so I mean just walk me through

426
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,630
when do I start do I go to IIT hire

427
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,869
engineers where do I set up my office

428
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:57,570
what kind of infrastructure will I need

429
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,450
like how do I build a start-up in

430
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,510
reaches that's gonna grow thirty percent

431
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:07,010
year-on-year let's start with money okay

432
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:11,069
definitely I mean if you are planning to

433
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:13,200
start organization with this objective

434
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,990
the first requirement is definitely the

435
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,180
resource pool so definitely it's not

436
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,540
just the the human element but the plays

437
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,329
also matters so probably a place which

438
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,750
can provide you some level of you know

439
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:30,120
be the the infrastructure advantage the

440
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,420
resourceful advantage so first is the

441
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,720
location second is the resource so where

442
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,880
do you recommend I put my R&D center it

443
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,170
depends kind of what kind of R&D if you

444
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,590
are into if you are into the gray market

445
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,410
then maybe Romania or some of those

446
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,990
places yes you will be talking about one

447
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,750
of the places very soon after we so

448
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,150
maybe one one or two places that we can

449
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,000
have where there is some kind of

450
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,350
protection for our research secondly the

451
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,230
infrastructure has to be really good

452
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,400
nowadays I don't think it's a problem

453
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,170
the infrastructure when we talk about

454
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,849
infrastructure then we have the VPN

455
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,170
residential we've been lot of technical

456
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,240
terms are there which gives you some

457
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,410
level of anonymity when you do the

458
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,740
research and all those things and

459
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:16,050
definitely the seed funding and in terms

460
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,780
of let's say the programming language

461
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,240
should I go for Python guys or Java XY's

462
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,369
or darknet guys

463
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
so from a technical perspective I would

464
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,000
always start with somebody who is very

465
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,319
good in C and assembly language to start

466
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,539
off Z and SMC and that's so

467
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,090
counterintuitive though right yes but

468
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:34,309
somebody who has worked at the lowest

469
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,250
level has a better understanding of how

470
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,620
system works all right so Romania go for

471
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,159
lower level languages and get seed

472
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:45,799
funding yes all right so chip you how do

473
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:48,260
I build a startup so I think you may

474
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,668
still have to further curate the startup

475
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,289
to say what is it that you're gonna

476
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,669
solve in the data beach area right is

477
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:58,730
that going to be forensics this is going

478
00:17:52,669 --> 00:18:00,169
to be a containment stealing data it's

479
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,029
other way round red is talking about a

480
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:03,710
hypothetical situation where he wants to

481
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:06,140
retire basically start sealing it and

482
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,500
retiring my startup steals data cells

483
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,330
Thera so I'm just taking at 1 aggregator

484
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,940
for data breaches right so what skill

485
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:18,710
sets do I need any fresh breaches anyone

486
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,029
I would definitely not advise you do

487
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,789
that unless you want to end up in jail

488
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,399
or whatever but but yeah if you still

489
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:26,649
want to go ahead and use this crazy

490
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:29,209
entrepreneur who wants to do something

491
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:32,418
then yeah I think you're going to have

492
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,250
to I think I would rather China's how

493
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,919
Beijing or some other place like that to

494
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,450
to get some experts never agree one guy

495
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,770
one star in the center Romania that

496
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,899
because they are just very good at

497
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:45,889
stealing stuff I didn't say that in

498
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:47,209
press that would be a good place to

499
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,980
start and because the talent is the key

500
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,679
at the end of the day I think it's not

501
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,899
the office not the infrastructure if you

502
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,539
have some of these people who really

503
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,399
know their regardless of where they

504
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,510
are they can I mean that's all that

505
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:00,820
matters right they have the whole

506
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,720
instrumentation they have the whole

507
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,428
infrastructure to do that pretty much

508
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,529
you know and cloud makes it very easy so

509
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,419
you just get easy account in a tableau

510
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,220
so GCP everybody is offering your

511
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,799
accounts and free accounts is go got it

512
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,529
yeah that's such a sorry yeah I should

513
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,210
go ahead so on the Romania point right

514
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,860
just to add to that I wouldn't pick

515
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,299
Romania but I'll just add to that how

516
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,158
many of you have heard of hacker will in

517
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,770
Romania and show friends on what's the

518
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,070
documentary on YouTube Netflix couple of

519
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,139
places

520
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,760
definitely watch it if you haven't it's

521
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,049
about this little town in Romania right

522
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,400
I gotta remember the name who's a little

523
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,620
bit hard to pronounce

524
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,450
120,000 population so probably less than

525
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,300
a average building in like Oregon Bombay

526
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:42,090
right so 100 great thousand population

527
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,740
it has more CD showroom and Adi won a

528
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,100
Beemer won a Porsche won pretty much

529
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,050
every luxury car that exists has a

530
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,240
showroom in that little town of 120,000

531
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,879
people right because you have a whole

532
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,950
massive set of hackers that live out of

533
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,780
that one town in Romania who've then

534
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,040
said oh my friend why did you come join

535
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,960
my business as well why don't you start

536
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,520
the scams as well and they've created a

537
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,490
whole economy of people who are getting

538
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,560
pure cash money from all these scams and

539
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,060
then going spending $40,000 to buy a

540
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,480
nice luxury car and drive around right

541
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,250
so so Romania might be a good place to

542
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,300
go but probably expensive resources

543
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,290
they've already made a bit of money so

544
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,840
yes so this hypothetical startup that's

545
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,780
gonna steal money right so right up my

546
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,159
right up my skill set because every time

547
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,540
it is a customer order it away you know

548
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,220
we're doing one of our engagements and

549
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,250
then we see access to really good

550
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,690
information really good platforms were

551
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,950
always tempted right should I should I

552
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,840
move out to the British Virgin Islands

553
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,420
get a passport like need of movie and

554
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,500
all of these guys and start trading on

555
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,240
the stock market make a ton of money

556
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,460
right but what I would probably do is

557
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,930
set it up in India if you look at the

558
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,910
bug bounty system in India right these

559
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,960
guys I mean kids are being offered $500

560
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,510
thousand dollars in a spending their

561
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,280
entire day and night hunting for these

562
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,660
bugs in try to find it right if you're

563
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,560
going after the right data breach I'm

564
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,180
pretty sure you can make a couple

565
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,350
thousand dollars per breached if you're

566
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,150
going after add more than that most

567
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,129
likely so you can definitely offer them

568
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,570
a bit more money get them to now come

569
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,950
spend their entire day and night

570
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,929
breaking into you whatever targets that

571
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,690
you identify and going after those guys

572
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,310
right and we already know India's track

573
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,720
record in terms of break tracking down

574
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,580
breaches and going after actually

575
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,440
arresting people through it might be a

576
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,490
decent safe here will for you to go

577
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,260
about and do this as well right

578
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,870
and then funding I don't think you

579
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,370
really need funding so I'll give an

580
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,199
example right so we were working on some

581
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,020
projects a couple of couple of months

582
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,310
ago and this is the customer that has a

583
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,790
board room management system that

584
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,230
they're using right and we start doing

585
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,610
an assessment and we find that there's a

586
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,170
back door in the board room management

587
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,209
system that the vendor is put in right

588
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,320
there's really small vendor that that

589
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,550
was selling this platform and this

590
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,379
backer had been there for three years

591
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,540
now I'd skin with about

592
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,090
100 plus Indian listed companies using

593
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,440
this platform with the back door to all

594
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,480
of the boardroom communication theater

595
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,980
sitting there for three years that's

596
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,270
that's your funding right there right

597
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,950
you read what these guys are doing buy

598
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,030
and sell some stocks you've got all the

599
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,740
money you potentially need you don't

600
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,270
need to ring is any capital you can keep

601
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,690
all your equity and you should be good

602
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,910
to go

603
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,800
oh that sounds great that sounds great

604
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,990
all right so we'll take a little bit of

605
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,909
a detour here and get some insights

606
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,760
about why this is such a tough problem

607
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,640
right so literally billions of data

608
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,920
records are stolen every single year and

609
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,500
the lowest hanging fruit if I may would

610
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,430
be probably adopting encryption to some

611
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,710
extent yet encryption is probably low

612
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:30,250
single-digit adoption across the board

613
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,260
right so why is that the case I mean the

614
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,510
the solution or at least the medicine

615
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,390
for this problem is out there but it's

616
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,220
not they don't like it I mean why is

617
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,780
that the case so let's start with money

618
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,480
we'll get some perspective of why

619
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,530
encryption has such poor adoption

620
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,300
okay so if you look at Bruce Nia's

621
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,610
statement he once said there are two

622
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,169
versions of it I think the first

623
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,030
question is if you think technology can

624
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,380
solve your problem you don't know you

625
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,670
don't understand technology and you

626
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,530
don't understand the problem and the

627
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,120
second version of it is if you think

628
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,860
encryption can solve your problem you

629
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,679
don't understand dedication so yes

630
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,199
encryption is good but encryption cannot

631
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,350
alone solve the problem the second point

632
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,850
is how we implement it so even if you

633
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,490
implement encryption that doesn't mean

634
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,110
you are secure and there are multiple

635
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,790
ways or there are multiple researchers

636
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,740
happening where you know hackers or

637
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:24,129
researchers are trying to break it so

638
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,500
the point here is encryption alone it's

639
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,470
just it's like the defense-in-depth it's

640
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,970
just one layer of it so you have to know

641
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,460
supplement it with all the best

642
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,420
practices the awareness but why would

643
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,460
for example Zomato or uber or whoever

644
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,310
they might be keep some of the data that

645
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:46,000
got breach in plaintext right just to

646
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,980
add to what I was saying two examples I

647
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,110
can quote the first one was if I am NOT

648
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,960
wrong the Sony breach where one of the

649
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,689
most prominent factor was Sony was

650
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,799
storing the passwords in plain text it's

651
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,179
not that Sony breach was

652
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,610
the bigger point but the bigger point

653
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,929
here was a big company like Sony how

654
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,699
they are not following the best

655
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:09,049
practices point number one point number

656
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,389
two is snapchat hack if you remember a

657
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:13,820
snapchat hack that happened I think four

658
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:16,699
or five years before before what's

659
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,408
happened reduced encryption snapchat

660
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,419
introduced encryption and one of the

661
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,759
mistake they did was their encryption

662
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:25,610
key they had coded into the source code

663
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,590
itself so encryption was there but how

664
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,928
it was implemented was the problem here

665
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,759
so again coming to the best practices

666
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,470
understand how encryption has to be

667
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:37,070
implemented that should help us address

668
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,230
this problem such it why what's your

669
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,939
take on this battle between convenience

670
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,789
and security like encryption is not

671
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,289
convenience kind of clunkier and and I

672
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:48,169
think there are three things that I have

673
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:51,139
learned over the years I think one is

674
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:52,190
this perception right most developers I

675
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:54,320
don't know how many developers in the

676
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,399
room here just just to engage and how

677
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,928
many security guys right so looks like

678
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,248
there were more security guys the room

679
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,239
that in developer sit there was don't

680
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,429
listen to all this stuff

681
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:06,200
so they when they dropped when the

682
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,289
pastor was cool they were told security

683
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,330
comes at a cost and they permeate that

684
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:12,739
fraud across the industry and they keep

685
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,840
changing companies right so the mindset

686
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:16,159
is o as soon as I do encryption my

687
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,080
everything's want to come to slow my

688
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,190
performance gonna take a big hit I just

689
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,580
don't want to even entertain the idea

690
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,350
right and you have a hard bargain now as

691
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,999
a security engineer to sell that no it's

692
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,799
not that bad given today's computing

693
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:29,809
infrastructure and everything else it's

694
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,039
not that bad right and but you need to

695
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,210
have hard numbers to prove to them

696
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,799
otherwise they're not going to entertain

697
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,559
you especially in data centers and at

698
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,269
scale right so - then the second thing

699
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,700
is of course the go-to-market thing

700
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:42,409
right so any new feature that is being

701
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,980
built who wants to business wants it

702
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:48,980
live yesterday right and security as

703
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,720
always is coming to the party late it's

704
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,269
like we have to go live security guys

705
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,710
can you do something and you know just

706
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,419
tell me what is there and then you tell

707
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,669
all dudes you have not use encryption

708
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,200
we'll get to that next release right and

709
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:02,269
the next weekend never happens because

710
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,750
the discussion is all slow things down

711
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:07,630
and forget it right so

712
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,740
and encryption of course is one of the

713
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,450
layers right I mean you could have a

714
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,130
sequel injection and encryption has no

715
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,950
meaning you can all get the data sellout

716
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,750
without the encryption but but people

717
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,150
should to use encryption I think that is

718
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,900
no it's almost like using a toothbrush

719
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,670
to brush every day is like pretty

720
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,860
reasonable now at the point that it is

721
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,990
ubiquitous it is available and the

722
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,060
technology is there to support it there

723
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,260
should be very less excuses to not use

724
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,050
it especially unless you are dealing

725
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,879
with legacy systems or a SCADA or you

726
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,980
know like I am right I'm now dealing

727
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,170
with automotive and they tell me issues

728
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,340
just don't have the capacity right so we

729
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,170
have to completely react it texture

730
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,879
everything the can protocol is not

731
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,130
supported so those are legitimate

732
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,710
reasons for not using encryption which

733
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:54,130
which means you could do something else

734
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:56,140
but in the context of cloud and and in

735
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,810
current scenarios there should be no

736
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,370
excuses it just to add to it we have the

737
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,500
concept of the first triangle the

738
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,760
functionality usability and security so

739
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,560
somewhere we have to find the right

740
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:11,350
balance between the three points I'll

741
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,210
give you an example here I'll we've all

742
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,129
everyone's known about the corona virus

743
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,900
everybody is afraid of the corona virus

744
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,160
right now how many people in the

745
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,420
audience went and bought travel

746
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,770
insurance or something of that sort to

747
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,780
safeguard yourselves right if something

748
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,980
goes wrong here how are you gonna get

749
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,180
home how are you gonna get medical

750
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,860
treatment how are you gonna pay for

751
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,150
everything how many of you our show of

752
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,240
hands actually thought about that did

753
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,460
something about that and this is exactly

754
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,750
so for the ones you can't see and this

755
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,390
is exactly what developers do it

756
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,640
security right the idea is yes it exists

757
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,620
encryption exists a whole bunch of

758
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,340
security capabilities exist but the

759
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,110
challenge is why bother right it's and

760
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,399
that's as simply as it is right the

761
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,560
developer has a whole bunch of

762
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,850
priorities he has business guys sitting

763
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,830
on his head going the release needs to

764
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,969
go yesterday we have X number of

765
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,110
features that aren't built yet they

766
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,030
haven't been tested yet they haven't

767
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,429
gone live yet

768
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,879
and then security is a parallel track

769
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,640
right and in India I mean again more in

770
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,990
the Indian context again this is my

771
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,030
opener how much you guys would have seen

772
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,320
of it but you don't see threat modeling

773
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,540
you don't see security in the dev

774
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,120
lifecycle at all so security comes

775
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,580
absolute last right product is built

776
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,530
it's packaged it's ready to release can

777
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,970
you please come review it now secure it

778
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,340
stamp it and let us go live with it

779
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,680
right and then you have two days to

780
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,419
release marketing's lined up businesses

781
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,610
lined up sales is lined up everyone

782
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,530
standing behind security going to days

783
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,060
do whatever you have to you need to

784
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,860
clear this F for me cut it live and

785
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,419
that's essentially why corners get cut

786
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,740
right so encryption is I mean it exists

787
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,200
it's easy to do it's plug-and-play

788
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,260
pretty much now but it's just a why

789
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,240
bother mentality right at startup that I

790
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,129
typically work with and seen other

791
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,950
approaches growth is all that matters

792
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,340
right if I need to do encryption I need

793
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,110
to now pull two engineers of my regular

794
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,520
build cycle and do something else and

795
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,860
it's not going to work and as such it

796
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,660
said at the legacy companies it's always

797
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,010
compatibility it's always oh but this

798
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,140
integrates with five different systems

799
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,220
so we need to spend six months looking

800
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,840
at the business impact from doing

801
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,380
encryption and it's gonna get pushed

802
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,929
back three-quarters then sure so looks

803
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,970
like at least from this discussion so

804
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,820
far that will forever optimize for

805
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,710
growth right ok all right so I'll come

806
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,120
back to my hypothetical startup Graham

807
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,510
remember the one we are making money

808
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,419
with so whoever wants to take it whoever

809
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:30,090
has a sense of how this is done so my

810
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:33,420
startup just got like a million records

811
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,980
get from from a bank for example and I

812
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,380
want to make sure that I really get good

813
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,350
money for this right so walk us through

814
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,230
what really happens once a group of

815
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,179
hackers has exfiltrated a million credit

816
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,440
card details what did it do with it I

817
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,480
how do they make money with it how do

818
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,140
they you know get free food for their

819
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,310
folks and and all the incentives the

820
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:58,740
Ferrari is small with the food that

821
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,960
books in Ferraris activity so walk us

822
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,830
through it I just exfiltration Atta now

823
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,390
what so probably two things I'll start

824
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,040
with the first one being covering your

825
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,700
tracks in the sense that you should do

826
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,649
you should not do anything that will you

827
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,450
that can track you back probably that is

828
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,789
the first thing and once we have done

829
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,940
that the second thing is how we monetize

830
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:21,740
it preferably the darknet or all the

831
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,539
only closed networks are the platform

832
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,340
for this where we need to have some

833
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,530
contacts with the brokers and that's how

834
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,129
it currently happens I am not advocating

835
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,270
for Asia but then what happens if

836
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,190
somebody wants to do some black

837
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:38,299
activities let's say he wants to hire a

838
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:40,039
server and what we generally do is we

839
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:42,740
pay double the amount and then get a

840
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:45,830
card for example if I want one thousand

841
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:49,820
dollar credit so I'll pay two thousand

842
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:52,158
dollars buy a black card and then use it

843
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,320
to hire the server so we need to find

844
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,419
brokers and spare you know online

845
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,820
selling spaces where we can use these

846
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:03,220
cards so that's the first approach I

847
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:06,110
would say to monetize whatever you had

848
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,789
so I'll go a little bit back in the day

849
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,408
witness right so about 15 years ago I'll

850
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:11,720
tell you what it used to be like and

851
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,640
what it looks like right now so I knew

852
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,809
somebody this is back in before we

853
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,240
started the company and in the hacker

854
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:19,129
days of my life right I knew some guy on

855
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,480
I think MSN Messenger or some IRC or

856
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,309
something of that sort

857
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,110
he'd got a million credit card records

858
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:25,580
pretty much your scenario that he'd

859
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,750
stolen of somewhere and I was kind of

860
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,178
fascinated trying to understand what do

861
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,340
you do with this information right and

862
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:33,440
the cycle of abuse is really interesting

863
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,879
and this is before the dark web right so

864
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,460
you didn't really have brokers and you

865
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,020
don't really have all of this available

866
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:42,260
so he would sell his credit cards to

867
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,299
some guy somewhere in Russia or Brazil

868
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,100
or something of that sort for about a

869
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:47,690
couple of dollars per credit card right

870
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,549
so he would get a billion dollars only

871
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,190
on that sword that was transferred to

872
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:54,139
him using some ayah something gold I

873
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,909
can't remember a paypal like service

874
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,440
back in the day that used to have you

875
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:58,610
know virtual debit card you can go pull

876
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,780
money out of the ATM and things of that

877
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,370
nature right so he would get his money

878
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,260
he would get his million dollars that he

879
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,729
would go over right now the question is

880
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,460
are a million credit cards what the

881
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,720
million dollars are they worth right so

882
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,890
then the next step of the process would

883
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,650
happen so the guy who bought them in

884
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,570
Brazil would go to India time shopping

885
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,850
or you know whatever ecommerce shopping

886
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,530
existed at the time this is pre Amazon

887
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,270
flip card for the for these some of the

888
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,649
young couple in the audience right and

889
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,620
they would go and they would order a

890
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:26,330
bunch of laptops and high-end

891
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,489
resellable Goods right and shipped them

892
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,199
to some random address in a small

893
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,790
village somewhere right so somewhere in

894
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,110
charge card or somewhere in behind where

895
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,200
the cyber police is not really going to

896
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,000
be on them as easily and one of their

897
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,010
friends are actually a third party

898
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,780
broker sort of guy right he would go and

899
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,910
he would rent out that house for a small

900
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,830
amount of time cash payments rent out

901
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,840
for one week spent five ten thousand

902
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,610
rupees whatever it is and all he would

903
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,679
do is all day long people would send

904
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,750
parcels to him he would sign the courier

905
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,100
take the parcel and that was his job

906
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,290
right stacked them filled in the house

907
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,760
with parcels end of three days four days

908
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,290
five days he would take all his parcels

909
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,420
together get a taxi we didn't have one

910
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,440
over the time you get a regular taxi and

911
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,930
then get out of there and go to wherever

912
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,490
he lives and he would then sell these to

913
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,510
other people in the black market who

914
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,720
would then in turn to sell them to

915
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,860
retailers would come out right and this

916
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,530
was literally the process of

917
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,479
monetization everybody across the chain

918
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,340
was making some money of the transaction

919
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,260
process and that's pretty much what

920
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,449
happens today right it happens in a

921
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,860
little bit more sophisticated manner so

922
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,210
now you have standard data brokers in

923
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,949
the dark web so you have websites we can

924
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,000
just score sell credit cards and the

925
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,140
credit card guy is going to sell the

926
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,490
personal information is somebody else

927
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,500
he's gonna sell credit cards or somebody

928
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,810
else he's gonna break it up into little

929
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,130
pieces and sell it outright how many of

930
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,210
you all have seen those work from home

931
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,550
ads that you see all over the place

932
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,110
right railway stations and everywhere

933
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,490
else is in have y'all ever thought about

934
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,469
why they're paying forty thousand rupees

935
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,540
for you to work from home or you know

936
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,580
whatever they claim right and this is

937
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,320
part of the data breach cycle what

938
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,460
typically happens is they'll contact you

939
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,040
and say okay I'm employing you and I

940
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,270
need to do some nonsense work I'm gonna

941
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,750
transfer fifty thousand rupees to your

942
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,690
bank account

943
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,740
or I need you to look after my India

944
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,280
operations I'm gonna send you a lakh

945
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,750
rupees

946
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,250
take your forty thousand rupees from

947
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,750
that as salary and transfer the other

948
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,040
sixty thousand other bank account where

949
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,380
one of my vendors is there but I need

950
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,580
some work done so you're happy you're

951
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,750
getting a lakh rupees you transfer the

952
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,370
sixty thousand out you keep the forty

953
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,600
thousand of yourselves and a week later

954
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,520
the bank calls you and says this was a

955
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,440
fraudulent transaction

956
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,210
I need you to really take the lakh

957
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,589
rupees back from you and you've now paid

958
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,619
six thousand out to somebody else and

959
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:25,609
this chain continues across countries to

960
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,649
the point where the money can't be

961
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:29,299
traced anymore the hackers pump their

962
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,469
million dollars in took about five

963
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,960
hundred thousand back out of the other

964
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,969
end through this chain of fraud and took

965
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,349
that for themselves and everybody in the

966
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,000
entire chain lost all the money along

967
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,710
the way because they all got scammed by

968
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,780
it so they come up with really creative

969
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,770
ways to take money out right another

970
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,960
case that I saw that was really

971
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,580
fascinating so this is a few years back

972
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,050
when mobile recharge sites were the

973
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,639
thing back in the day right

974
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,619
so we had a very interesting case that

975
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,080
we did forensics for we ran across a

976
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,460
customer where these hackers had

977
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,598
basically gone and copy pasted the

978
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,310
checkout page right the page where you

979
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,990
put your credit cards in and just remove

980
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,040
the credit card process so you put in a

981
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,270
phone number you put in the amount of

982
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,250
money you hit to recharge it will go

983
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,810
through the API and recharge it what the

984
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,970
den did was they went to all the street

985
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,560
shops are on Bombay and they started

986
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,089
licensing it to different would have

987
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,250
phone shops and your Airtel shops and

988
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,810
all this guy is saying use the recharge

989
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,869
using my website and I'll give it you at

990
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,339
50% off so that actual crime and the

991
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,290
fraud was happening in the Sri Tail

992
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,730
level they would drive around on a bike

993
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,770
one so we collect the cash from all of

994
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,780
these guys and when that backpacker

995
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,040
detected the company reaches out to all

996
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,119
these shop one as a shop owner sells we

997
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,259
have no idea of these people are they

998
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,119
just came approached us offered us a

999
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,440
deal and we took it and they walked out

1000
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,940
with all that cash so it's always an

1001
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,820
ingenious model to get that money out of

1002
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,369
the system sure you know you want to ask

1003
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,010
just to add to this the crypto

1004
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,630
currencies now adds you know another

1005
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,240
layer of anonymity to the

1006
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,640
money-laundering part so now it's I

1007
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,709
think it's legal in India now forget

1008
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,930
about the legal part in India so you

1009
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,880
know just like what he said what used to

1010
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,098
happen 15 years before now it happens so

1011
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,920
the cryptocurrency channels which which

1012
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:05,420
adds the anonymity also sure if I may

1013
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,310
add I think they've already covered a

1014
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,780
lot of the basis here and you can see

1015
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,529
clearly the whole supply chain is really

1016
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:16,410
strong definitely stronger than the

1017
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:18,180
supply chain as discussion here

1018
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,940
like change for this business is really

1019
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,350
strong and very healthy and thriving but

1020
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,490
the other way to do that is you just go

1021
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,660
back to the same bank that you stole

1022
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,520
money from and just Sarah it's

1023
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,930
ransomware and we blocked your money you

1024
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,790
know this is it's worth 10 million

1025
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,740
dollars give it to me or whatever or I

1026
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,259
kill I delete all your data right and

1027
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,180
that may be just good enough and most of

1028
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,100
these banks or companies fortunately now

1029
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,470
have insurance and they're happy to pay

1030
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,089
that me I was actually talking to one of

1031
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:44,009
the cyber insurance agents this few

1032
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,200
weeks back and they told me sir this is

1033
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:48,660
the value add we even if you get hit by

1034
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,810
ransomware we will pay the we will do

1035
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,490
the negotiation with the the party and

1036
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,720
we will pay them out you don't have to

1037
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,339
worry you will get your data back that's

1038
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,470
part of the business quantity bland now

1039
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,330
so it's very very well organized

1040
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,740
becoming very sophistical industry has

1041
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,110
come around to this item and as a

1042
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,939
business not just doing this right so

1043
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:09,120
let's change gears a little bit and talk

1044
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,730
about this rising phenomenon of data

1045
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,520
nationalism right data localization in a

1046
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:17,940
more technical sense my data needs to

1047
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,890
reside in my country so what's your

1048
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,900
purse what's your thought on is it going

1049
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:25,230
to make data breaches easier harder

1050
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,910
probably it's got no impact can you kind

1051
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,310
of shed a little bit of light on what

1052
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,200
data localization might do to data

1053
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,600
breaches or is it going to be easier

1054
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,899
that if you want Indian eating habits

1055
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,339
just go hack this data center as long as

1056
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,690
you are connected to the Internet I

1057
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,730
don't think it's going to make some

1058
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,560
difference because you are connected

1059
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,180
it's it's like it's like the corona

1060
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,100
virus whether you are in India or in

1061
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,560
some other country as long as people

1062
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,779
interact you are vulnerable so I don't

1063
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,880
think it's a good concept but from the

1064
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,760
data breach perspective I don't think

1065
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,400
it's going to make a difference because

1066
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,680
again it's are we using the Indian

1067
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,050
softwares or Indian Hardware the point

1068
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,629
lies in the bigger picture just by

1069
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,300
putting a you know Indian data in a

1070
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:13,440
Chinese software doesn't make it secure

1071
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:15,570
so the point is it's a good concept but

1072
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,450
from the data breach perspective if you

1073
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,580
ask like is it going to be the number of

1074
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,310
attacks going to come down my my point

1075
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,259
is no just to add to that right I think

1076
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,710
it will actually get worse the problem

1077
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,720
because now as a data owner

1078
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,160
my data in one place well now I need to

1079
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,450
make a copy in India for the Indian

1080
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,920
customers I need to make a copy in China

1081
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,109
for the Chinese Chinese customers in

1082
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,390
America for the American customers I now

1083
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,920
have 25 times the data distributed

1084
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,500
across 25 times the systems and

1085
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,060
therefore my the the cost or the

1086
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,710
effectiveness of my monitoring my

1087
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,080
security defenses my assessments

1088
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,960
everything is increasing right so my

1089
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,790
focus where there's data in one location

1090
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,930
and I'm really looking at it versus this

1091
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,450
data distribute across 25 different

1092
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,580
countries with 25 different custom data

1093
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,470
localization compliance different laws

1094
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,109
that will impact that data is going to

1095
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:07,439
make the security job much harder just

1096
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:09,210
to add to it then we will have your yes

1097
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,930
I don't know how many of you remember

1098
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:15,420
the Geo app which was the birth reverse

1099
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,490
engineer three or four years before if

1100
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,290
you look at the Geo app it used to send

1101
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,359
your geolocation to three servers in

1102
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:24,060
India and that backup server was in

1103
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,130
China and the update that used to happen

1104
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,440
was without encryption which means

1105
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,359
anybody can intercept your backup or dr

1106
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,339
activity that is happening and find out

1107
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,740
where as the Indian general traveling

1108
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:36,839
now and what is this geolocation so when

1109
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,259
it comes to the dr part are you planning

1110
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,730
to put your dr location in india itself

1111
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,230
then how do you address the data

1112
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,589
localization that these are the

1113
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:50,310
questions or challenges that we have

1114
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:51,420
yeah I think the most regulators

1115
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,250
probably don't understand technology

1116
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,540
enough that's this one challenge why

1117
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,109
they coming up with data localization

1118
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,009
laws and I think the other thing is just

1119
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:00,330
censorship or whatever I did in other

1120
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,180
countries where they want you know I

1121
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,859
want full control of what's going in and

1122
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,020
out of my pipes and so I want to

1123
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,420
regulate everything right and which is

1124
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:13,530
why I did so tomorrow Facebook cannot

1125
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,660
you know you know put me in a difficult

1126
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,830
position where I I don't know how to

1127
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,750
track this terrorist because I don't

1128
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,339
have access to that data so the

1129
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,570
government's I understand they're coming

1130
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,160
from the security angle and they think

1131
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:26,250
just because they have the data in here

1132
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,589
they can override the the cloud provider

1133
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,900
and somehow get access to the

1134
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:32,480
information at the fingertips right but

1135
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,560
if you look at Apple they have

1136
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,080
vehemently opposed this whole philosophy

1137
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,960
in the US and have not given the keys to

1138
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,210
the US government despite so many you

1139
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,850
know fights and everything else and so

1140
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,020
it makes

1141
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,029
so you have to give the power back to

1142
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,290
the consumer its consumers data let them

1143
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,360
figure out what they want to do with it

1144
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,340
right why are you making decisions at at

1145
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,470
the policy level saying all this data

1146
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,060
has to decide in this country or that I

1147
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,859
think it's silly and from a security

1148
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,590
standpoint like everybody else said it's

1149
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:02,410
an ad of a lot yah-ha because the

1150
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:05,080
security engineers the concentration if

1151
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,960
you look at it most of the best security

1152
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,910
Minds defenders everything are still in

1153
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,000
the Western countries more or less right

1154
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,200
they are better equipped to protect some

1155
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,260
of the information if it's stored there

1156
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,120
as opposed to somewhere in like geo or

1157
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,490
whoever will be much harder for them to

1158
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,460
do yeah I hope Ambani is not kind of

1159
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,049
watching the live telecast all right so

1160
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,730
we are we're just doing a bit of a time

1161
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,080
check here so our last couple of

1162
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,300
questions where I would encourage you to

1163
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,549
keep your points very brief and to the

1164
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,100
point so that we have at least some time

1165
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:39,310
to take a bunch of questions from the

1166
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,350
audience here right so the first

1167
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:44,590
question I have for all three of you

1168
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:47,170
starting with Manu is just imagine a

1169
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:50,350
privacy-preserving internet and how

1170
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,940
would you build one I personally don't

1171
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:55,299
believe there is no privacy

1172
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:57,400
as long as you are connected so I don't

1173
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:01,420
think that is practically possible to

1174
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,150
build you know 100% privacy effective

1175
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,610
but still you know in case if you want

1176
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,160
to attempt or build something something

1177
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,560
that keeps resetting everything after

1178
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,899
probably you know one day or two hours

1179
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,090
and also saying and maybe proper

1180
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,130
encryption so that you know no one

1181
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,570
authorized access is possible some some

1182
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,110
technologies we have to come out where

1183
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:24,220
only my data resides here and it is not

1184
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,740
stolen by anybody

1185
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,470
maybe encryption on the fly when data is

1186
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,879
at rest so some of these are the point

1187
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,589
that we could consider but personally

1188
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,540
speaking I don't believe there is a

1189
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:39,370
privacy today and not in the near future

1190
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:41,890
huh yeah I think it's true that today I

1191
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:44,080
mean you cannot guarantee of course 90

1192
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,850
percent but I think there is hope with

1193
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,590
new technologies like especially

1194
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:50,500
differential privacy and home Orphic

1195
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:54,190
encryption once they become mainstream

1196
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,030
in the next few years I feel that we

1197
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,950
could get

1198
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,180
to a place where we can have a privacy

1199
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:02,830
preserving mechanism in place I think

1200
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,000
but we're aware of you years away from

1201
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:08,680
atria so for me personally I think the

1202
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,060
concept doesn't really exist I don't

1203
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,310
think there's ever going to be a point

1204
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:14,320
where it's going to be a privacy

1205
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,840
preserving Internet right because I mean

1206
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,400
I have a I have a problem with the word

1207
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,350
unhackable every time I hear this term

1208
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,730
because the concept of hacking is you

1209
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,110
look at what it is and you find ways to

1210
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,400
break what it's supposed to do right so

1211
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,740
when you talk about a privacy preserving

1212
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,150
Internet no matter what you put into it

1213
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,129
the concept is that its job is to

1214
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,500
protect privacy and the hackers going to

1215
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,510
find ways to go around try it it's its

1216
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,610
security is always an iterative process

1217
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,540
you build better controls the hackers

1218
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,640
gonna build better ways to break the

1219
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,900
controls and hopefully in the meanwhile

1220
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,700
you haven't been complacent that you've

1221
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,440
built even better controls in you keep

1222
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,480
that cycle that dots going right so

1223
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,680
there I mean in my opinion at least

1224
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,300
there's never going to be a there's

1225
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,730
never one thing or one point that's

1226
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:56,260
going to result in a privacy aware

1227
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:57,580
internet and especially until you remove

1228
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,060
the human element from that whole

1229
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,710
equation so just for the organizers if

1230
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,090
you want to pass on the mics because

1231
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,490
right after this question we'll take

1232
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,170
some audience question so feel free to

1233
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,640
raise your hand get the mic if you have

1234
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,410
a question in mind for the panelists but

1235
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,109
I have one question before we move on to

1236
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,660
you guys so all right panelists gaze

1237
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:19,600
into the crystal ball the context is

1238
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,770
breeches tell us two or three things

1239
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,080
that are going to happen in the future

1240
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:26,200
from your personal experience your

1241
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,270
personal understanding is it gonna get

1242
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:32,200
worse better somewhere in the middle

1243
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,970
give us something breeches are going to

1244
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,649
happen all our data is already there on

1245
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,509
Tintin it's some of us are aware some of

1246
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,920
us are not aware people who are

1247
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,340
technically sound they're aware of what

1248
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:46,600
what is the level of exposure the second

1249
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:49,200
s data is money so there is going to be

1250
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:52,120
more demand for your personal browsing

1251
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,890
preferences your you know where you

1252
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,839
prefer to travel all your personal

1253
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:59,170
choices so data is going to be breached

1254
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,150
how how we are going to address it is

1255
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:03,420
what is the point that we need to

1256
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,420
concentrate

1257
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:10,069
yeah I think we've already come to the

1258
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,009
conclusion that we have to assume breach

1259
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:15,800
right I mean that's pretty much there I

1260
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:19,240
think the biggest thing that we can do

1261
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,320
as individuals and and as corporates is

1262
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,049
how do we reduce the damage to the

1263
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,750
radius it's impossible and in there are

1264
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,500
a few I feel tech knowledge that are

1265
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,619
emerging

1266
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,430
like I said differential privacy seems

1267
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:33,849
very promising

1268
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:36,980
to me at least in some certain context

1269
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:39,140
and if we can apply them as scale

1270
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,780
I think things can improve over time I

1271
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,970
am very pessimistic as a security guy

1272
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,520
but as I being a more optimistic spy

1273
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:50,930
would like to keep with me and that's

1274
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,220
why I want to take that so I don't think

1275
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,569
that is it getting better right I don't

1276
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,730
think we're ever gonna get to a point

1277
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:57,560
where breaches reduce what we'll

1278
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,940
probably see happen is people building

1279
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,220
systems and platforms with the

1280
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,780
assumption that there's a breach so I

1281
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,879
like the Gmail example is a good example

1282
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,280
you are right today if I give my gmail

1283
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,720
password to all of your the odds that

1284
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,760
you'll actually end up in my inbox are

1285
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,040
very low right because second it says a

1286
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,830
new browser we want an OTP different

1287
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,089
location we need to validate again

1288
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,140
secondary controls intelligent based

1289
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:19,369
controls that are going to prevent

1290
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,589
reaches of where you will really see a

1291
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:23,690
lot more coming out because breaches

1292
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:24,859
will happen your data will go out but

1293
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,359
companies have to sort of find a way to

1294
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:29,330
work around that and have less

1295
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,680
dependence on a static data set I think

1296
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,390
this is a password or this is other

1297
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,250
ideas my social security number and

1298
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:37,069
figure out better more dynamic ways to

1299
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:38,540
have the those assets like your other

1300
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,800
booty P that happens now or you know

1301
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,759
your two factors built in everywhere

1302
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,760
you're searching those improvements

1303
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,220
coming all right cool so we'll take some

1304
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,070
audience questions now so there's a

1305
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,899
gentleman in the right here in the front

1306
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,369
all right so please introduce yourself

1307
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,839
I'll leave it to you if you want to

1308
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:55,339
introduce the organization because

1309
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,080
knowing the context help them

1310
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,440
contextualize the answer right so please

1311
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,920
do that

1312
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,640
sure my name is Aditi I'm from meadia

1313
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:07,250
nama I have two short questions one is

1314
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,629
about who buys this breach data of

1315
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,839
course there are brokers but who's

1316
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,630
eventually buying it advertising firms

1317
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:14,250
ecommerce firms

1318
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:18,030
who is it that's monetizing this data

1319
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,910
and the second is that all of you talked

1320
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,890
about that there there are no economic

1321
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:25,319
incentives for companies to actually

1322
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,930
boost the security because there's it's

1323
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,000
year it's cheaper for them do can you

1324
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,330
hold up your mic little bit it's cheaper

1325
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,830
for companies to pay ransomware

1326
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,200
attackers or things like that or just

1327
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,640
resumes or like this a matter example

1328
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,919
where they thought that there hasn't

1329
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,779
been any tangible harm to their brand

1330
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,720
therefore they can get away with it you

1331
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,640
think a regulatory approach where they

1332
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,279
have to report to an authority and an

1333
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,650
authority can impose fine to the tune of

1334
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,210
say four percent of the turnover or 15

1335
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,040
crore rupees as is the case with the

1336
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,140
personal data protection bill that's a

1337
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,779
useful step that will act as a deterrent

1338
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:03,270
keeping in mind that globally that

1339
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,630
hasn't helped with Google where

1340
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:09,810
children's data breaches etc I think you

1341
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:12,300
imposed a five billion fine nothing

1342
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:14,279
really changed at Google after that it's

1343
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,170
just these two questions okay so for

1344
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,330
everybody to hear the question her first

1345
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:20,400
question was who is buying the data

1346
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:24,090
where is ecommerce companies or what

1347
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,330
type and second was the incentives

1348
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:29,550
around how to prevent some of these

1349
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,130
things right like your Zomato example so

1350
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:34,230
who wants to take this maybe all of you

1351
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:37,290
can give very briefly because we want

1352
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:39,360
more questions so under who's buying you

1353
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:41,250
it's not really gonna be businesses

1354
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,390
essentially it's more hackers we're

1355
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,730
gonna find other ways to sort of

1356
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:47,220
leverage the data and come up with

1357
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,930
better ROI on their investments so

1358
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,069
buying healthcare data putting it

1359
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,899
together with credit card data being

1360
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,970
able to then go create a fake profile is

1361
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,260
get a social security number then going

1362
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,209
and getting a housing mortgage on his

1363
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,710
name you know fraud that takes it much

1364
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,830
further than the the just the credit

1365
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:04,140
card fraud so and we are also buying all

1366
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:05,819
of the data so it's I mean you'd be

1367
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,129
amazed how easy it is to buy breach data

1368
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,810
it's literally a couple of dollars for

1369
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,040
pretty much mode so like we literally by

1370
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,960
pretty much every beach to reach that

1371
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,070
comes out to study the data to

1372
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,360
understand the data and second for me

1373
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,950
the answer can really short answer and

1374
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,250
this is I think the regulatory approach

1375
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:24,720
is effective having done a lot of

1376
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,340
business in the EU having done a lot of

1377
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,759
business in India as well

1378
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,890
the challenges there is a so what answer

1379
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,050
the customers give right you have a

1380
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,879
problem there's going to be a breach I

1381
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,100
don't have an answer for so watch right

1382
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,460
now right

1383
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:42,480
so what sir publishes I go he can what

1384
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,190
does it matter right we don't really

1385
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,390
care about we don't really have we're a

1386
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,710
media company we don't really care about

1387
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,870
the brand in that perspective we don't

1388
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,910
have financial data so that's so what is

1389
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,230
always there and what I have seen

1390
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:54,899
working with a European customers at

1391
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:57,270
least is with gdpr with these things

1392
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,680
coming up if we see it being taken a lot

1393
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,450
more seriously right they have that

1394
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,589
answer is so what there's going to be a

1395
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,870
fine there's going to be a business

1396
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,760
impact there is a reporting process so

1397
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:08,880
if we see them taking the thing a lot

1398
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,920
more seriously and also I think a lot I

1399
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,090
mean it looks like a lot more breaches

1400
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,350
come out in the EU but that's only

1401
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,450
because the reporting the breaches is

1402
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,620
compulsory everyone in India is just

1403
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,660
sweeping it under the rug right so

1404
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:22,770
pretty much 1% of breaches actually come

1405
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:25,049
out to the public yeah I think to add to

1406
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,370
what he said there's of course the

1407
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,960
commercial markets I mean the

1408
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:29,759
underground channels that sell but

1409
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,710
there's also nation-states either there

1410
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,840
are countries who want to buy data for

1411
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,890
obvious reasons right so it would go to

1412
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,100
them as well and there's a whole

1413
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:40,470
meddling whole economy around that right

1414
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,870
the second thing regulations yes

1415
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,490
regulations are good in a way to push

1416
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:46,549
the agenda but like you rightly said

1417
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:51,689
Facebook paid a billion dollars whatever

1418
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:53,580
fine right so I think the the we need to

1419
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,870
even step up further less efficient in

1420
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,130
Southeast Asia if you look at it I was

1421
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:58,589
there for quite seven year two years

1422
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,300
there there is a jail term for the CEO

1423
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,800
if there is the data privacy beach right

1424
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,500
so that actually holds him accountable

1425
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,930
at the sea level otherwise what ends up

1426
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,340
happening is the CEO will just point to

1427
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,950
the sea so the sea so gets fired and

1428
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,590
that's the end of the story

1429
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:16,410
so the accountability has to shift back

1430
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:18,630
to the business owner in this case or

1431
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,910
the CEO of the company and if there is

1432
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,680
the jail term to it this it's like if

1433
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,299
you were to do financial fraud today you

1434
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,100
would end up going to jail as a CEO of

1435
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,690
the company it's the same for security

1436
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,370
it's like because the security can

1437
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,230
impact a lot of the business decisions

1438
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,960
that you make right so it has to be that

1439
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:37,320
level of accountability well I'll just

1440
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,130
add to the first question so just assume

1441
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,809
you have the top 100

1442
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,500
influential people in bangles complete

1443
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:44,630
database

1444
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,520
who's going to benefit from it anybody

1445
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,319
who can do business with that data they

1446
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,700
are going to buy it let's let's accept

1447
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:53,180
the fact the second does the

1448
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:55,220
state-sponsored agencies or entities the

1449
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,509
third one I would add as the threat

1450
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,520
Intel companies they are very much

1451
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,319
interested in all the data leads and

1452
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,079
password leaves and all those things so

1453
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:06,380
I would rate these three as the you know

1454
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:09,319
answer to your first question and her

1455
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:10,940
second question was around how to have

1456
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:12,890
the structure of incentives or

1457
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:15,640
disincentives to really prevent it

1458
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:18,558
because right now nobody really cares so

1459
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,960
just to the first example that we quoted

1460
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,300
from Apple is a right answer to that if

1461
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,510
you if you increase the amount of the

1462
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,339
bug bounty the people attracted towards

1463
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,750
the black market will will be less it's

1464
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:31,609
something like the Singapore Minister

1465
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,069
model where the ministers are paid very

1466
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:36,109
huge amount as salaries so that you know

1467
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:38,540
they don't take the bribes and all those

1468
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:41,390
things so some some approach similar to

1469
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:44,680
that would address that problem all

1470
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,680
right so let's have our next question

1471
00:52:47,349 --> 00:53:01,460
yes I would like to have your insights

1472
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:04,790
on one of the classical breaches which

1473
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:07,460
has happened on Ashley Madison online

1474
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:10,790
dating site I would like to have your

1475
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,690
insights on how or if any changes have

1476
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:14,930
happened after that

1477
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,880
what happened during that time cause the

1478
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:20,000
data was lost a lot of people their

1479
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,470
lives they had a lot of issues again in

1480
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,210
their personal life because of the data

1481
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:28,700
breach but finally the amount which was

1482
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,799
paid by the company in lawsuits and all

1483
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:36,368
was very less we all know that has

1484
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:38,809
anything changed in that I don't think

1485
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:41,359
so just to be clear has anything changed

1486
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:43,640
at Ashley Madison Madison yeah no no

1487
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,230
actually there is a change their market

1488
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,770
share has increased after that but I

1489
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,770
want to know

1490
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:54,559
after that the industry any changes are

1491
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:55,758
guarded a new pitch readers for

1492
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,999
marketing yeah

1493
00:53:55,759 --> 00:54:00,349
so I'll just share one example that

1494
00:53:58,999 --> 00:54:02,209
happened three months two to three

1495
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:04,160
months before one of the DJ very famous

1496
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:08,029
DJ in India I I know him personally so

1497
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,190
he was kind of you could say honey trap

1498
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:12,529
initially couple of requests came to his

1499
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:14,210
Facebook Twitter and then they started

1500
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:15,920
interacting and all those thing and

1501
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,450
slowly they they found lot of

1502
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,119
information about him his family and

1503
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:22,189
then it was a it was a Chinese mafia

1504
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,569
operating from Philippines so what they

1505
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,880
started doing is started blackmailing

1506
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:27,650
him they started calling their relatives

1507
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,019
and all those things so just to come to

1508
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,779
the core point the data that was breach

1509
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:34,640
could be utilized in the way that you

1510
00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:36,769
know they use it for blackmailing or

1511
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,930
tracking you and all those things which

1512
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:42,140
how do we monetize it or you know how do

1513
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,910
we put a people suicide also yes not a

1514
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,769
lot of examples are there so the my

1515
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:48,230
point is a soft now I don't see maybe

1516
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:50,328
major changes happening these breaches

1517
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:53,930
really can affect our personal life the

1518
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:55,700
business part lot of the only potential

1519
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,470
change that probably happened is a lot

1520
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,210
of regular folks were made a lot more

1521
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:00,980
aware about cyber security because

1522
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,690
breaches like Ashley Madden they sell

1523
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,009
headlines right there they're much more

1524
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,249
interesting and a Sony breach which

1525
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:09,499
doesn't really have any end-user impact

1526
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:11,930
so that is good for cyber security I

1527
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:13,038
guess yeah I mean it is good for cyber

1528
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,629
security expect for the companies who

1529
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,339
get impacted because at least they start

1530
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,569
taking security more seriously a little

1531
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:19,578
bit I mean any of these companies who

1532
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:20,808
have had a breach I think it's a I feel

1533
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:23,329
so blessing in this guy's in many ways

1534
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:25,519
because that forces them to think about

1535
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:30,769
security because otherwise they would

1536
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:32,868
not right so all right so we'll take

1537
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:35,238
more questions to the benefit of

1538
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:39,950
everyone so there was a question from a

1539
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:41,239
gentleman here and the front I think

1540
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:48,980
this you wanted to answer you have a

1541
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:51,339
question hello yeah okay this is our man

1542
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:56,809
chick from the cell in more sacred come

1543
00:55:51,339 --> 00:56:00,290
sir my question is - yes sir how many in

1544
00:55:56,809 --> 00:56:03,860
data breach in case you have dealt with

1545
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:07,570
what was the which case was the toughest

1546
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:12,050
case in this 14 years of time trade in

1547
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:13,820
security PDG abrogated right yeah I mean

1548
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:19,460
I can't really go into names of who was

1549
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:21,050
breached but it's it's I can't even I

1550
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,650
mean honestly I can't even tell you how

1551
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:25,820
big a problem it is it's it wouldn't be

1552
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,170
an exaggeration to see that we'll run

1553
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,990
across one case every single week for

1554
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,130
the last 14 years so it's all over the

1555
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,270
place right every time you doing an

1556
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,800
assessment you're looking at anything

1557
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,320
you suddenly find some backdoor

1558
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,070
somewhere you will first identify a

1559
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,270
tremendous amount of data where this

1560
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:42,680
evidence of this data has gone out

1561
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:43,940
already it's incredibly common across I

1562
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,859
mean I'm not even saying that if smaller

1563
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,150
companies as in we've seen it at large

1564
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,400
financial institutions we've seen at

1565
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:51,320
healthcare institutions in India within

1566
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,300
the domestic space right is this it's

1567
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,610
tremendous the amount of breaches that

1568
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,900
duped a place so which is one of the

1569
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:58,820
reasons as well for me I think breach

1570
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,980
notification is should be the absolute

1571
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,150
first priority there is nothing that

1572
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,440
forces that come in to tell you that the

1573
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:05,480
breaches happen right so you don't

1574
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,830
really know how bad the problem is until

1575
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,720
our data comes on the dark web and then

1576
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:10,460
you get those emails telling you that

1577
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,049
your you have been captured on

1578
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,090
screenshots and you need to pay some

1579
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:15,800
Bitcoin to get get your data back stuff

1580
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:22,220
of that is I will take two more

1581
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:24,050
questions there's one here buddy I'm

1582
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,509
sorry man I'm a blue team member at

1583
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:28,490
Microsoft my question to all of you is

1584
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,770
you touched upon the bug bounty programs

1585
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,209
so as a defender myself

1586
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:35,060
we are already dealing with you know

1587
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:36,830
tracking nation and state actors and

1588
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,779
things like that and now we have the bug

1589
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:41,060
bounty programs where you rightly said

1590
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:43,730
you know the person could go rogue so

1591
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:46,400
how do we prepare for it and also on the

1592
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:49,100
lighter note you also touched upon you

1593
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,750
know everybody being hacked right and

1594
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,600
everybody being aware of it and nobody

1595
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:56,630
caring about it right so if I just hit a

1596
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:00,049
have I be important on my most commonly

1597
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:01,760
used email and no matter on anything we

1598
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:03,740
see that it's being hacked so we as

1599
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,570
fresh security guys in our career should

1600
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:10,640
we pack a bag because nobody is caring

1601
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:12,510
about it anymore I'm afraid I kind of

1602
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,000
did not get the question

1603
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:17,310
what I love the question that to be

1604
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,170
honest so maybe I zoned out abortion was

1605
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:24,180
affordable first of all like if you can

1606
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:26,910
just check the mic yeah so my I don't

1607
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,290
know there's some flickering okay my

1608
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:31,980
first question was on the bug bounty

1609
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:33,900
programs right so how do we track for

1610
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,660
this and how do we as defenders be

1611
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,430
prepared on this just to clarify you

1612
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,290
mean under how because the volume of

1613
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,578
attacks is increasing you don't really

1614
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,380
know if it's a legitimate attack or an

1615
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:45,510
illegitimate Arachne and the background

1616
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,280
is from a blue team in Microsoft so as a

1617
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,170
defender how can they prepare themselves

1618
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,700
right so let's take some very quick

1619
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:55,200
ticks there isn't a good way for you on

1620
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,640
the defender level to do anything it has

1621
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,439
to be more institutional so if you look

1622
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,328
at the Facebook bounty program for

1623
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,650
example they have a whole separate

1624
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:03,599
environment separate accounts that you

1625
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,950
have to register in put through when you

1626
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,240
actually do your testing right so then

1627
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:08,189
from a defense standpoint you know

1628
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,149
whether it's a bug bounty hunter or

1629
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:13,619
which illegitimate attacker yeah so it's

1630
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,940
more institutional I think but you have

1631
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:16,530
to respond to everything is the same

1632
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,329
right because if I'm a bug bounty

1633
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:20,300
attacker and if I'm compromising a core

1634
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:22,380
system are you going to stop me or no

1635
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,780
it's still your data it's still your

1636
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:27,300
liability so yeah I would agree

1637
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,040
you can basically stop the attack right

1638
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,660
there if even if the bug bounty of the

1639
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,250
heart is testing if you have the

1640
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:34,078
visibility your blue team should be able

1641
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:36,119
to stop them right and then you can

1642
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:40,829
actually do a real-world red versus blue

1643
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:43,170
for you right we will do one thing we'll

1644
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:45,599
have more closed discussions outside if

1645
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:47,520
that's all right with you right so amanu

1646
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,589
your take on how we can do a better job

1647
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,300
point one is monitoring regular

1648
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:53,220
monitoring on what's happening who where

1649
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,569
where the attack or the testing is

1650
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,368
progressing and is it within the

1651
00:59:54,569 --> 00:59:58,290
boundaries first this point the

1652
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:01,290
monitoring and second is what yes said

1653
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,970
have separate mechanisms to identify who

1654
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:05,910
is the researcher who is doing the

1655
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:08,339
testing and whatever is outside the

1656
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:10,078
circle is an attack for you probably

1657
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:13,049
it's hard to do that unless you're going

1658
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,000
through one or something some mechanism

1659
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:16,560
has to be in place where you know either

1660
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,089
you do don't do it in a production

1661
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,259
network but taking the example of

1662
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:21,330
Facebook

1663
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,830
you are allowed to do it on life so then

1664
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:25,049
you should have a mechanism to identify

1665
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:27,120
it's almost like an institutional

1666
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,800
mindset later than one individual all

1667
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,200
right so we'll take one last question

1668
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,180
you're very welcome to you you're very

1669
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,680
welcome to interact with the panelists

1670
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,690
over here oh no offline but there is one

1671
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:45,830
question here gentleman in the red

1672
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:49,440
t-shirt hello yeah my name is Raju I

1673
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:51,540
know like most of us here are like we

1674
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,360
are working in a private companies and

1675
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:57,410
we follow like industry standards like

1676
01:00:54,360 --> 01:01:01,170
least and other regulatory and

1677
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:04,170
competences but like my question is like

1678
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:06,510
we know like in India most of the

1679
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:09,930
digitalization is happening especially

1680
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:12,090
in government size and like is there any

1681
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:14,549
like idea of like do you guys how like

1682
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:18,530
whether government of India is taking

1683
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:21,960
any following any security standards are

1684
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:24,240
like organizations like these like Malka

1685
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,910
or any organizations they are going to

1686
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:31,740
help India to like secure there were

1687
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:33,720
like most of our data is there any part

1688
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,979
of that right so I think certain and

1689
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,410
Nick have been doing a great job in

1690
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:40,050
terms of in implementing processes and

1691
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:41,190
systems in place and I see them doing a

1692
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,110
lot of really promising things the

1693
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:45,560
challenge is to some degree the Indian

1694
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:47,790
jihad right so I'll give you an example

1695
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,779
I don't know how many feel understand

1696
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,910
the process but there is something

1697
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,520
called certain impaneled vendor right so

1698
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:55,290
in India every government agency has to

1699
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,140
get an audit done by a certain impaneled

1700
01:01:55,290 --> 01:02:01,170
company before they can go live into the

1701
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:03,089
internet right and the challenge is like

1702
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:05,280
there's this one company that I we heard

1703
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:07,350
about through a customer that was

1704
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,570
selling certificates for $5 apiece lat

1705
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:11,970
know order to be done no testing to be

1706
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,870
done come raise an order give me 5000

1707
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,609
rupees I will give you a certificate

1708
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:16,770
back you can go live with that right so

1709
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:18,750
the the government is taking a lot of

1710
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:20,880
effort its companies that have to now

1711
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,500
take a so the question is when you as a

1712
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,270
government agency you typically out such

1713
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,800
a development right do you put pressure

1714
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:27,090
on your vendor contractually saying you

1715
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,500
need to go to good security when they'll

1716
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:30,480
get a certificate follow these best

1717
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,830
practices we need to sir contractually

1718
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,339
building those things in and take that

1719
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,229
ownership

1720
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:36,989
as opposed to just regulation and you

1721
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:38,549
know making sure we check the boxes some

1722
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:40,920
I know your take what's India doing or

1723
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:42,180
further if you just don't look at what

1724
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,410
is happening today if you look at the

1725
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,210
progress that happened in the last

1726
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:46,529
fifteen years or ten years you will see

1727
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:48,839
a lot of progress happening from the

1728
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:50,640
government side one simple example I can

1729
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:52,349
quote which I don't know how relevant it

1730
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,940
is ten years before because I am also

1731
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:56,309
running a conscience like this ten years

1732
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,969
before we use to go behind government

1733
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:59,160
officials

1734
01:02:56,969 --> 01:03:02,430
please come and attend conferences like

1735
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:04,589
null corn or XYZ conference now today

1736
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:07,078
the scenario is completely safe now they

1737
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:08,940
are coming and say we want ten passes 20

1738
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:09,930
passes we want to attend and so you can

1739
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,329
see there is a change

1740
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:14,249
secondly the feedbacks that they take

1741
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:15,719
from here definitely considered and they

1742
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:18,089
look into it a lot of things are

1743
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:20,430
happening but as I started the first

1744
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,869
point two days before I was interacting

1745
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,399
with couple of students where I was

1746
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:25,170
teaching them digital certificates so

1747
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,549
one student asked sir in India if I

1748
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,349
wanted he still said debate what does he

1749
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:30,299
process which is the agency and I said

1750
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:33,680
CCA the student opened the CC website

1751
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:35,880
and it is not HTTPS so that's the

1752
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,749
paradigm or you know that's the state

1753
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,609
but it's there is no personal data there

1754
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:43,379
things are improving I believe in the

1755
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,880
next five years we should have a better

1756
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,559
posture as far as security is concerned

1757
01:03:44,880 --> 01:04:23,099
but I would say yes we are on the right

1758
01:03:46,559 --> 01:04:24,839
track we need more time basically yes so

1759
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:26,910
here comes the first triangle problem

1760
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:28,769
the functionality usability security if

1761
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:30,960
we go to incognito mode every time I

1762
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:34,348
have to add my Gmail username password

1763
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,119
or Facebook for sites I login four times

1764
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:39,690
I have to enter it so that's why some

1765
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:41,910
some people prefer to go with the VD it

1766
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:43,979
not the incognito the regular mode

1767
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:46,230
basically so what point you said this

1768
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:47,970
mode from the security point I agree too

1769
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,349
but here comes the you know the

1770
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:50,848
usability or the functionality

1771
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:53,250
Sujit can answer this what would the

1772
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:56,940
conversion team at Hoover say to having

1773
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:58,859
incognito by default the business

1774
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,150
conversions would be down 50% hundred be

1775
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:02,339
looking at a billion users as your

1776
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:04,740
customers is just not gonna fly right

1777
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:07,589
you cannot cater for all our audience

1778
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:09,000
there all right gentleman we'll bring

1779
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:10,890
our panel to a closure

1780
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,230
we have been pointed out twice that we

1781
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:14,970
have run out of time so thank you so

1782
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:17,099
much for all of your time I hope it was

1783
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:18,899
interesting we discuss a lot of

1784
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:21,359
interesting topics we also discuss how

1785
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,369
to build a start-up in enough data

1786
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,890
hacking and Thank You panelists for your

1787
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:27,540
valuable time and if anyone of you would

1788
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:31,940
