milton organizers were having this

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,009
wonderful opportunity though it's kind

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,579
of sad because I won't be able to join

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:39,480
you live and also personally physically

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:43,200
being in Goa I haven't been in India I

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,209
was really hoping to see your place but

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,989
unfortunately due to some travel

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,270
concerns that will be postponed for

14
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,419
therefore the mean time but that won't

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,219
stop us or sharing information and

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:02,640
helping you folks there in your region

17
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:05,700
be more safe and digitally secure so

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,900
yeah my goal is just to share the

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:15,080
information or this this actually

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:19,350
technique but it's more of a process and

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,270
ways for you to do analysis quick

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,179
analysis on any information that you

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:32,699
receive especially from those people

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:36,509
that you do not really know so okay I I

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,600
won't make this long this will be a very

26
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,570
short presentation is that this is

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,689
recorded I hope that you can use this as

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,559
a resource and probably shared to some

29
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,139
of your colleagues and in the region so

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,790
our discussion will be on basic here

31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,329
it's a 3d analysis and data and

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,159
information and but before that a quick

33
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,850
quick talk I mean I picked background

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,200
off of myself my name is Tom Bowen area

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,269
I'm working as a digital security

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,599
consultant for internews

37
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,599
and

38
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:20,958
my background actually I came from I

39
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:24,109
actually came from incorporate so I do

40
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,769
have pretty much experience in

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:33,680
cybersecurity so I started my career as

42
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:35,569
a the Linux administrator and then the

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,930
security the cybersecurity world

44
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:42,500
actually fascinates me from one from how

45
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,560
one person gets him to gets to own the

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,260
entire network because me as had as an

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,269
administrator I have the role to secure

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,798
the network and to make it you know

49
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:58,099
working but I come up I actually ran

50
00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:00,470
into this book spore somewhere here in

51
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:04,339
in the Philippines and I was able to

52
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:08,269
read the 2600 calm magazine and that

53
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:15,160
actually gives me like you know it was

54
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:18,079
like I opening so since that I tried to

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,970
learn cybersecurity and eventually

56
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,359
worked as a security analyst for some

57
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,389
managed security service provider and I

58
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:29,829
actually have some folks I work with

59
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:33,650
some folks there in no time

60
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:38,450
and yeah it's really good to see some

61
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:42,590
old friend doing I mean presenting on

62
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:45,048
the same event so yeah I work make my

63
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,329
first work as security analyst and then

64
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:54,310
I used to deal with a lot of events and

65
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:59,389
cyber attacks for some of our clients

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:02,209
and then I just realized that the idea

67
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:06,019
of the whole cybersecurity thing

68
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:09,680
information security thing is not that

69
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,379
just it's not just about attack so I'm

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,620
kind of curious how they do it so I try

71
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:18,500
to learn penetration testing and then

72
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,899
after that yeah I was eventually made

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,570
into a job I was a penetration tester

74
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,409
and it's really fascinating knowing from

75
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,240
both ends how they work

76
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:34,500
how an attacker uses a technique to gain

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,710
access to compromise something like a

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,730
computer and then on the other and

79
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:44,159
understanding how these people defending

80
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,180
their network protects it from from from

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,880
an attacker so from a security

82
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,010
standpoint I'm trying to learn how would

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,090
you actually how everything works within

84
00:04:53,010 --> 00:05:00,330
the ecosystem so I also tried to see if

85
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:04,710
I can learn auditing and stuff so I

86
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,469
tried to study like PCI DSS these are

87
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:12,090
like the compliance stuff for companies

88
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:15,450
so I also had landed a job in nightly

89
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:21,270
auditing and it's really cool I mean I

90
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:23,520
cannot say that I'm an expert but I can

91
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,159
say that at least I have like the

92
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,310
working knowledge for all of these areas

93
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,620
in cybersecurity and also I'm also a

94
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:39,780
teacher of a trainer for cyber security

95
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:42,920
awareness program so I do teach classes

96
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,080
for penetration penetration testing

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,470
Incident Response and of course the

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,479
security awareness program so it's like

99
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,140
security it's like more of a passion to

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,140
me and it's really fun learning stuff

101
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,550
all the time and so right now I'm

102
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,419
working as a security consultant for

103
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,280
engineers I'm working as a digital

104
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,720
security consult for the Southeast Asian

105
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:14,010
region so I specifically support

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,460
countries within Southeast Asia and this

107
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:21,030
is in terms of capacity building

108
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:25,080
consulting and auditing and training as

109
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:29,010
well so yeah I pretty much deal with a

110
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:34,380
lot of organizations within the region

111
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:37,830
and also just a quick introduction of

112
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,370
inter news introduce is an international

113
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,349
organization

114
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,360
with the the goal to empower local media

115
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,680
worldwide in delivering news and

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,370
information in their respective

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,510
communities we do this by providing

118
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:58,000
resources training capacity building for

119
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,719
organizations or even individuals that

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,169
needs assistance so me as a digital

121
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,800
security consultant my role is to

122
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:13,599
provide of course digital security

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:18,550
support for this for local media's so

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,229
I'm really hoping to at least work in

125
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,620
the future with you guys you know at

126
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:27,490
least be there to like really support

127
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:33,700
you in your work in the region so yeah

128
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:36,700
having said that let's go to the this

129
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,490
proceed my goal is really not to make

130
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:45,130
this long because it's really boring

131
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:49,450
listening to a recording honestly I've

132
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:53,469
done that try to learn stuff online and

133
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,969
it's so boring but of course the good

134
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,770
thing with recording is that you can

135
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:04,000
repeat it all over again so at first

136
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:06,250
usually when I do like when I try to

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,210
learn stuff over the Internet

138
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:12,490
I really couldn't and I mean I really

139
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,419
can't finish any recordings I mean like

140
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,330
video tutorial so I have to come back

141
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:21,549
again and again at least you learn all

142
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,680
the stuff that's on the content but for

143
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:31,660
this one so I'm just gonna make this

144
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:34,360
very short and okay so um let's start so

145
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,979
as a journalist most of you guys usually

146
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:42,310
deals with a lot of information reports

147
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:46,270
stuff that you receive and you send so

148
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:50,500
these are actually in types of things

149
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,870
there are most mostly seen as document

150
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,990
text document PDF or

151
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,830
and sometimes it's actually seen as your

152
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:03,010
LX or like I'd rather say web pages or

153
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,860
websites those are that's those are the

154
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,650
most common things where I mean types of

155
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,400
a medium where we can actually get

156
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:15,550
information nowadays and we should get

157
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,779
them from from your CODIS most of the

158
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:24,459
time from email from external contacts

159
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:27,370
from partners from funders from families

160
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,250
and friends so it's also including in

161
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:37,180
most specially from from unknown sources

162
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:38,860
or contacts and the way see we usually

163
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,239
receive those kind of information or

164
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:48,190
from email and chat so I do use

165
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,410
messenger like whatsapp signal and it is

166
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:55,020
it's beginning to actually really

167
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:59,230
overcome I mean over I mean yeah

168
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,920
overcome the my way of receiving

169
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,950
information rather than email so I start

170
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,020
to get a lot of more information in my

171
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,630
chat messengers instead of my email so

172
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,339
it's kind of bit true for myself I don't

173
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,560
know with you guys but these are like

174
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:19,410
the two most common ways for you to

175
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,959
receive those information and apparently

176
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:29,020
this ways of communication are also the

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:31,630
ways that attackers try to get try to

178
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,040
attack us in some way or totally mean

179
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,680
what your so called social engineering

180
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,560
so if you if you like join the first few

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:46,120
days not sure if if some of you are here

182
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:49,660
I mean on the event social engineering

183
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:54,580
basically is a way for someone like like

184
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:59,380
say malicious malicious hacker it's this

185
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:02,950
way to trying to convince someone to do

186
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,780
something that he wants him to do let's

187
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,980
say for example a classic example this

188
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,040
is

189
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:13,320
some simple as phishing emails so with

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,349
phishing emails usually the the sender

191
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,690
tries to convince the receiver the email

192
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,920
to click on something like whether if

193
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:26,320
it's an ad whether if it's a malicious

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,719
website or anything at all neither

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,290
whether if it he wants to download this

196
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,700
soft

197
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:37,180
I mean the file or open a file this is

198
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:40,170
the way how they actually try to start

199
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:44,229
the attack by sending this kind of

200
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,540
malicious messages sometimes it's in the

201
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,970
form of fake warnings usually I receive

202
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,540
this most of the time in my email saying

203
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,730
that my Google password

204
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,099
I mean my Google account has been hacked

205
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,650
you know I'm pretty much some of you

206
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,310
actually experienced this but this is

207
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:06,640
this is how they use it I mean this is

208
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:11,310
how they try to get into your system or

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:14,260
try to capture your credentials and and

210
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:19,599
aside from that will be actually talking

211
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:21,819
about two very popular case studies the

212
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,630
number the first one is the appellant

213
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,150
cat investigative journalism group where

214
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,580
they receive some phishing emails by

215
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,680
protonmail and the second one was the

216
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:37,690
Pegasus software which is actually in

217
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:40,239
whatsapp so I don't know I was actually

218
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,000
about to ask you guys my degrees of hand

219
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,430
if any of you is using any of you are

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,730
using whatsapp but if you're using

221
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,520
whatsapp this is a this is a good

222
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,300
example for you guys so let's start with

223
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:59,280
the bell Inc an email phishing so with

224
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:03,430
the Bella cat email phishing the belikov

225
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:10,689
organization actually reported this to I

226
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:14,140
let's see they actually got this email

227
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:18,040
and they actually find it suspicious

228
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,600
already because of the way the Melissa I

229
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,020
mean

230
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,420
'we believe the email is sent to them

231
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,420
initially when you look at the email

232
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:33,510
it's like the it's like really you know

233
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,850
a legitimate email from support from the

234
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,760
support team of program because from the

235
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,650
sender you can see their support at

236
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,350
program in let's see h which is the

237
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,550
actual domain support at mail the pd i

238
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:51,210
think this has something to do with

239
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:55,020
their government its stuff with germany

240
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm not sure but everything seems normal

241
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:04,050
as you can see on the email but looking

242
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,150
at the links that we have here so it's

243
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,680
that it just says that the privacy may

244
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,980
have been compromised which will

245
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,900
actually raise concern and then someone

246
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,030
has exported your private keys for

247
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,630
address which is the email address of

248
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:21,329
the victim or the target this means that

249
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,160
now your emails can be decrypted and

250
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,830
compromised if you do not recognize this

251
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,870
action blah blah blah click this

252
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:34,230
generate password generate this one so

253
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:36,870
it's like you it's reassuring that we

254
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:40,590
get the try to make this email and then

255
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,630
they will ask you to do something so for

256
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,180
the majority of some users usually when

257
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,540
they see this kind of email they kind of

258
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:52,260
you know started to get panicked I mean

259
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:56,069
started to panic in and be worried about

260
00:14:52,260 --> 00:15:00,030
the email address that was mentioned on

261
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:02,340
the message but if you but if you look

262
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,550
further on the email address that was

263
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:09,570
sent to the belikov team you will

264
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:12,750
actually see that the links that was in

265
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,480
there aren't really I mean the

266
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,720
legitimate websites so the original web

267
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,990
sites I mean the original web site was

268
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,300
supposed to be protonmail HTTPS

269
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:28,130
protonmail calm so that's a legitimate

270
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:31,680
one the links that we have they're

271
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,430
actually redirects the user whoever is

272
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,449
going to click on the

273
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,709
like to this fake websites number one so

274
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,839
we have actually two

275
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,089
fake websites there the one is the male

276
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:47,040
dot total male dot s each and password

277
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:52,860
in case the other domain is male

278
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:56,630
protonmail dot CH so if you can see kind

279
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:03,899
of look similar to what the original

280
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:07,920
domain was and if if I'll be someone

281
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:10,709
who's been you know really haven't had

282
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,069
enough training on digital security and

283
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:16,859
have a phishing worse probably someone

284
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,010
was gonna it's almost gonna fall into

285
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,839
this trap by the way just to mention if

286
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,459
you would like to know more of the the

287
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:32,720
investigation of this we can look up the

288
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,719
resource at the source the link below so

289
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,980
the way we do basic analysis is pretty

290
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,930
simple

291
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,810
we have like online tools like our suits

292
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,199
all URL Boyd in hybrid analysis those

293
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,760
are the three tools that we can use and

294
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,390
what we just need to do is to copy the

295
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,959
URL that was embedded on that link and

296
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,819
then paste it on the website so on the

297
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,750
virus at all you actually have a place

298
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:08,089
there where you can paste the link or

299
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:08,089
the URL and let me try to show you that

300
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,859
okay

301
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:34,189
I'm not sure if you're still seeing this

302
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:48,158
but let me try to share this to you

303
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:48,159
again okay just give me one second

304
00:17:51,549 --> 00:18:05,960
share screen there okay so all right so

305
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,720
the virustotal webpage when you view

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,529
that it will actually give you a couple

307
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,789
of options

308
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:18,289
number one is for you to upload a file

309
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:22,850
like here so you can actually upload a

310
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:25,220
file there and then yeah basically when

311
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,080
you click Choose file you're able to

312
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,080
select the file that you want to scan

313
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,928
and then upload it to virustotal and

314
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,689
they will run multiple scans on that

315
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:39,860
particular file but on our case we would

316
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:42,289
like to know a specific URL if it's

317
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,110
malicious or not so I'm gonna check back

318
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:57,860
the protonmail made the program.i our

319
00:18:45,110 --> 00:19:00,799
message so it's so it usually quickly

320
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,600
says that it's a phishing email so you

321
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,408
have to be very careful with that so

322
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,889
this is more of a practice for us to

323
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:13,700
know if a certain information that was

324
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,529
sent to us is malicious or not I mean

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,279
this is a good way for you this is a

326
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:22,669
good practice it's not just you just

327
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,970
click the link and by the view what's in

328
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:27,970
it I remember when I was still like

329
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,340
working as an administrator and

330
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,850
I'm not really familiar with this kind

331
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,610
of stuff I just find myself after

332
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,850
clicking the link it actually goes

333
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,129
through a totally irrelevant page of

334
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,600
advertisement it's tough and I don't

335
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,290
know what's happening on the background

336
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,240
reading and it's kind of scary so what

337
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,430
we're trying to avoid is for you to just

338
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,430
click any links that you're not supposed

339
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:57,550
to do we're not supposed to click and

340
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,140
let's see the other URL let me just pull

341
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,120
up the other one

342
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:06,540
it's mailed protonmail that's the age

343
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,540
[Music]

344
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:23,320
there so from the from from the example

345
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,590
we can already say that this is a

346
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,070
phishing email I should not click any

347
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,050
link so the good thing with this is that

348
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,360
you can share it to any of your

349
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:37,210
colleague you can just send an email to

350
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,620
anyone within your organization within

351
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,140
your contacts I tell you someone's

352
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,540
sending me some malicious email I'd like

353
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,670
to warn you just be sure that this is

354
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,730
something that you review first before

355
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:52,420
you click all right so that's really

356
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,330
cool and you already protected yourself

357
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:58,450
you've already invited yourself from

358
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,550
getting but your I mean your system

359
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,200
getting compromised there's either way

360
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:06,360
there's something behind a page that

361
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,460
will either steal your credentials or

362
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:15,669
infect your browser or a computer but on

363
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:16,920
this case going back oh this is so

364
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,690
difficult

365
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,380
give me a second oh yeah there we go

366
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:25,780
okay going back to the presentation this

367
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,290
is something that will actually try to

368
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:33,460
steal credentials because this both the

369
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:38,320
the both URL can I do anything

370
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,670
this is this one these are like getting

371
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,610
something getting your password this

372
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,190
stuff

373
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:46,269
so you'll you already know that this is

374
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,980
trying to get steal your credentials so

375
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,860
you have to be very careful with that

376
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,140
no not all phishing email will basically

377
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,719
look like this some some phishing email

378
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,230
will ask you to download a word or an

379
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,019
image a word document a photo or a video

380
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,750
you also have to be very careful because

381
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:10,190
some files that are sometimes uploaded

382
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:14,570
or sent on an email or even hosted on a

383
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:16,850
server or a website something can be can

384
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,490
be malicious as well so same thing if

385
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,860
you receive a file before you click it

386
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,549
it's really better to at least go to

387
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,370
virustotal and have it scan but again

388
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,929
there's there's a pitfall on that the

389
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,799
thing is that when you upload it to

390
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:36,950
virustotal it will leave a record there

391
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:39,830
that says someone had scanned the URL or

392
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,980
a file so if this is a pretty much

393
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,928
targeted attack and it's like zero day

394
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,380
vulnerability when you say zero they

395
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:51,470
attack like no one or no one knows it

396
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,899
yet you're pretty much seeing nothing in

397
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,740
there it will it will definitely say

398
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:58,158
that it's clean

399
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:04,039
so again versatile is not the hundred

400
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:06,830
proof hundred percent full full proof is

401
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:10,120
all right yeah okay so it's not hundred

402
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:13,428
percent work it will only work if the

403
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,668
URL or the website that you paste it on

404
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:22,070
it has some history or has been reported

405
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:25,580
as malicious so yeah again not hundred

406
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,168
percent okay so moving forward there are

407
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,590
other tools that you can actually use

408
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,590
let me

409
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,870
so there are also other year tools that

410
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:50,879
you can use number one is the versatile

411
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:53,250
your elbow it is also a good tool and

412
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:55,500
hybrid analysis is also another one

413
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,929
let's see some screenshots of that so

414
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,090
for the virus little again this is the

415
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:04,769
report of the mill for the mill that SH

416
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:07,379
the one the the the pay at the website

417
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:10,139
that was embedded on that link that we

418
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,908
got from Bellingham phishing email the

419
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:17,490
other one is also in the malicious email

420
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:21,629
and here this is the URL URL void fish

421
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:25,230
elites if they don't really have the

422
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:27,658
same result but for this one let's say

423
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,840
you've pasted it in the mail throttle

424
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:34,830
mil-dot CH domain and then it shows you

425
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,689
like a blacklist or something you can

426
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,720
scroll down at the bottom and actually

427
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:43,139
see and view more details on what's

428
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,870
reported and why or why it is reported

429
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:48,149
so when you move forward and click that

430
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:52,129
that's before on this slide this will

431
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:55,678
show up so it will tell you the category

432
00:24:52,129 --> 00:25:00,840
counterfeit web pages and be careful

433
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,100
with that same thing so um with hybrid

434
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:06,689
analysis the good thing with the hybrid

435
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:09,240
analysis is it's like creating a virtual

436
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,149
computer I mean it creates a virtual

437
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,340
computer or virtual machine and then it

438
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:17,850
will actually visit from the actual site

439
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,709
it's like testing the the site itself by

440
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,480
opening a browser on the computer and

441
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:27,149
going to mill program meal that's eh and

442
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,779
from what you actually see here is that

443
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:33,360
it's it's like the combination of result

444
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:37,879
one is from virus model and the other

445
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:42,600
one is the Falcon sandbox reports

446
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:45,059
they're really helpful tool again

447
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,750
I just like to highlight that you should

448
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,309
be very careful with any links or any

449
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,740
files that you have because once that

450
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:54,770
you click that there's a

451
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,570
yeah there's a chance that there's

452
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:00,480
especially if it's considered like

453
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,090
categories it's malicious we don't know

454
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,350
what's in in that page or what's in that

455
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:10,770
link so please be careful how you can do

456
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:15,330
it is the way I do it and or most of the

457
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:17,580
security security folks is that babe

458
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,270
they try to I believe there's a term in

459
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:34,040
here but you can what you can do is like

460
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:38,910
to replace the HTTP and stuff this one

461
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:41,520
let me put a circle in there and then

462
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,250
replace this with with X and then try to

463
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,540
separate the dot so it won't be a

464
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,240
clickable link

465
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,559
you know guess when you have like the

466
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,420
regular link in there

467
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:54,120
it's something that you can click on so

468
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:57,000
it's a technical answer the kind of

469
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,070
dangerous to try to do this if you're

470
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,040
trying to make note of it or make note

471
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:09,059
of the the the website or the URL okay

472
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:12,240
so moving forward we try to summarize

473
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,490
this with a couple of steps so whenever

474
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,260
you see like a message on your email

475
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,170
that asks you to do something work click

476
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,110
on the link or something that comes from

477
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:25,500
an unknown person this is coming from an

478
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,360
unknown person right so papi do you link

479
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,700
by right-clicking and then copy did link

480
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,510
basically inter note that and then open

481
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,550
it and virus hola

482
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,860
so that's very simple if it's a

483
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,340
shortened URL you can do the expand your

484
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,809
el down that and then paste the the

485
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,780
bitly something usually it's like

486
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:45,178
deathly shortened email URL right and

487
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:49,710
paste it in it and then you'll see the

488
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:53,370
actual URL also if it's a file or an

489
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:56,250
attachment do not open any file you can

490
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,620
just download that and actually upload

491
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,830
upload it to virustotal or hybrid

492
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:04,409
analysis for review you can also try to

493
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,330
open that in Google Drive that's a lot

494
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,360
safe

495
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,250
and basically the last part check the

496
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,320
email headers for any domain mismatches

497
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,570
the somewhat kind of tricky in but I'll

498
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:22,290
try to see if we can cover that today in

499
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:25,260
this discussion ok so again just fair

500
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:29,330
warning treat any unverified link or

501
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:33,690
file from any unknown sources malicious

502
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:36,540
yes and if you have clicked a link let's

503
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:39,540
say you just learned about this stuff

504
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,700
and then yesterday someone sent you an

505
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,040
email and then you click the link and

506
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,150
nothing happened it seems nothing seems

507
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,070
to happen and there's something on your

508
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:56,280
computer access or I mean your phone

509
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:58,530
acts really strange i really suggest for

510
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,100
you to disconnect from the internet and

511
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,139
then turn off your device and then last

512
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,419
thing is have an expert take a look on

513
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:14,340
your device to see if there's something

514
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:16,500
wrong with it alright so again important

515
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,439
very important you know virus odel is

516
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,200
not hundred percent foolproof some of

517
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,300
the files links may have no record of

518
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,590
malicious I may be using in the in the

519
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:31,230
past therefore there's no records of it

520
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,720
this usually happens I mean it happens a

521
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,370
lot especially if the attacker just like

522
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,180
created the website a couple of months

523
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:41,489
ago or like a few weeks ago and then

524
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,410
since the link to you particles

525
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:48,510
specifically to you just to target you

526
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:51,030
it won't show any any records of it and

527
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:56,460
also they have like a way to bypass the

528
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:58,500
scanning from versatile yeah and I know

529
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,780
the folks in Bolton pretty much know

530
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,210
what I'm talking about so if you like to

531
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,310
ask more about they can pretty much

532
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,830
answer your questions but they can know

533
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:11,909
they can we can do that they can somehow

534
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:14,520
find a way to bypass those scanners and

535
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:19,140
also when you upload links or files to

536
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,160
any of those tools online you may alarm

537
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,610
the attacker

538
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,460
or the malicious attacker that is trying

539
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:31,320
to get you you letting them know that

540
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:34,980
you are already aware that they are

541
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,280
attacking it just just to give them just

542
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,280
to give you guys a heads up so um yeah

543
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,920
so case study another case city it's

544
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,960
over you thirty minutes and this will be

545
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:54,090
very short after this topic mobile

546
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,610
devices are increasing in attacks a few

547
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,209
points in here Pegasus spyware targeting

548
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:04,530
specific users miss Cole triggers these

549
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:06,090
are most of the Pegasus offer well the

550
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,149
reason why you add mobile device in

551
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:11,250
there is because it's pretty much

552
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,980
cleared by the reason why they are

553
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,770
attacking more mobile devices because no

554
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,430
mobile devices you cannot afford to have

555
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:23,160
it shut off right usually when it's low

556
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,710
and battery just plug it in and it keeps

557
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,590
them running there's no downtime for

558
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,930
mobile devices it's like it's like the

559
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,659
most popular target now that they've

560
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,640
done it now these things and the biggest

561
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:41,190
software will try to talk about that

562
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:45,150
later on whatsapp the fact that it's the

563
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:47,580
spyware if they installed itself on your

564
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:51,350
phone whether it's an iOS or an eye

565
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:54,659
droid and in their the report actually

566
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:57,120
verifies that in India there's the

567
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,060
majority of Indians are being under

568
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,429
surveillance being affected by fiber but

569
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,020
played a negative spyware sure we'll

570
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:08,850
also talk about the miss cold can

571
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,370
trigger an exploit why I mean that's

572
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,709
really nasty you don't need to do

573
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,050
anything at all you'll just make a phone

574
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,780
call and then if you missed it you

575
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,350
didn't you did not do anything at that

576
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,420
point

577
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,100
so how about that oh my goodness how we

578
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,130
gonna address that how we're going to

579
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:30,030
avoid that next is exploit can need to

580
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:33,210
compromise it's like the end scenario

581
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,899
that if a here compromised this is the

582
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,450
calls made

583
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,960
recordings and collection of information

584
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:45,390
such as email and contact so these are

585
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:48,360
like examples of the phishing email I'm

586
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,240
not actually email but messages volume

587
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,449
as it's actually SMS if you can see it's

588
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,500
kind of similar the way it looks with

589
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,930
the phishing email

590
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,780
it's the link it gets as well and when

591
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:03,030
you click the link it's gonna go to a

592
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:06,000
website which has all the exploit and

593
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,190
then it didn't compromise the phone so

594
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,270
if you're familiar with amid Monsour

595
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:15,050
case this is the actual screenshot of

596
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:20,190
the message that he actually see

597
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:23,389
courtesy of citizen that so the way you

598
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:26,790
analyze that same thing we just type in

599
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:29,180
the URL but for this case support we can

600
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:32,580
not sure guys if you can understand that

601
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:38,580
same thing you go to that link paste it

602
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,409
in the Arsenal hybrid analysis your

603
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,850
avoid see if it's something there's

604
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:45,360
something in there malicious in there

605
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:48,629
and if you are still uncertain try to

606
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,479
get an expert I believe that you at

607
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:55,530
least once in a while have in I mean

608
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,240
have contacted a digital security expert

609
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:03,420
in the region but if not I'm actually

610
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:06,180
offering our service and I left Milton

611
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:10,679
let's talk about that later on after the

612
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:13,679
discussion another fishing report this

613
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,480
is from Rafael Cabrera from Mexico it's

614
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,970
also journalists investigating the

615
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,130
corruption in Mexico so there there's

616
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:23,330
also something that's pasted in there

617
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:26,070
there's still link in there dangerously

618
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:28,489
so if you can see this is an example of

619
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:32,159
the bit link so you don't know what's in

620
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:35,209
what's what's behind that so you go to

621
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:40,350
expand URL down there a sit in there and

622
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:43,500
then copy the link paste it in one of

623
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:47,549
those tools so

624
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:56,010
they're talking about what we can do

625
00:34:47,550 --> 00:35:01,109
about this Andrew Appel and some of the

626
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:05,400
organizations or majority of the digital

627
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:07,799
security defenders actually have come up

628
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,740
the depletion of like this is the thing

629
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:14,250
that we need to do so recommendations

630
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:18,450
for you guys as well as for everyone

631
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:20,609
who's listening on this presentation so

632
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,910
never open any link or file from non

633
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:25,890
contact never installing software for a

634
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:30,060
non-contact bigger device

635
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,410
ASAP include applications under placer

636
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,990
and Apple serve because sometimes we

637
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:38,520
just tend to take the device itself but

638
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:42,240
not those apps on that are installed

639
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,130
basically and all three eighths examine

640
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,470
URL when logging in or entering your

641
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,349
username password consider using the

642
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:52,709
signal or more sensitive information so

643
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:56,490
the last recommendation sometimes I do

644
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,800
recommend really signal as a means of

645
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:02,129
communication but the challenge is that

646
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,640
not all or in signal in forcing them to

647
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:08,609
signal isn't really good thing at all so

648
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,520
having said that there's something that

649
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:13,700
we can do on our apps if we are like

650
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,009
constrained to the app that we're using

651
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:21,109
so we can just harden your messing you

652
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,730
up then let's say on whatsapp you have

653
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:26,060
privacy settings security settings then

654
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:30,440
two-factor or two step verification

655
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:33,029
enable so that actually hardens your

656
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,490
messaging app or decoding box have

657
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,070
you're using signal we can do the

658
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,470
privacy lockscreen and then you also

659
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,260
