hello everyone my name is La Vina and

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,840
the founder of in ciphers and I will be

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,579
coming to Nell Congo at 2020 and will be

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,800
giving a training on iOS application

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,390
hacking like pro this happening

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,039
this training is about finding and

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,170
exploiting vulnerabilities into more

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,180
than our u.s. applications the training

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,920
will consist of a lot of exciting

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,560
hands-on challenges which you will be

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,510
solving during the training the

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,129
vulnerabilities which ranged from that

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,050
vulnerabilities which you can find in

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,850
through ecstatic analysis as well as

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,890
dynamic analysis the training will also

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,010
cover runtime instrumentation biometrics

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,320
and deep link exploitation and and so on

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,599
and so forth the training is basically

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,129
very interesting form would be very

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,980
interesting for people who either

22
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,849
develop and Hayase applications or

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,288
mobile application security enthusiasts

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,940
application owners penetration testers

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,890
the whole training is designed to

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,440
enhance their knowledge on iOS

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,600
application security so I welcome you

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,679
all to come to now Congo or 2020 and

29
