1
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:10,800
okay hello everybody I'm very excited to

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,470
be at null Con this is my first time to

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,510
India and I think I'm actually a lot

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,400
safer here from coronavirus and I will

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,300
be in the United States so I feel good

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:31,859
about this decision so my name is

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:35,310
Michael e lo all right okay so my name

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,160
is Michael e I am in charge of doing

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,730
security at the intercept which is the

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,080
newsroom in the United States I have

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,279
been working in source protection and in

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,310
journalists security and encrypted

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,260
communications for a long time now and

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,580
I've specifically been working with

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,420
journalists since 2013 wall Edward

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:03,170
Snowden was preparing to leaked

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,469
documents about the NSA and the GCHQ

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,329
and the intelligence community uh I was

19
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,880
talking to Glenn Greenwald and Laura

20
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,369
Poitras journalists he was leaking too

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,170
and I kind of helped them make sure that

22
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,399
they had encrypted communications so

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,399
that they were doing this as safely as

24
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:21,659
possible which is why I have my job now

25
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,920
because that was before the intercept

26
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,670
existed

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,630
so I'm also a open source developer I

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,350
work on tools like onion share if anyone

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,119
is going to be around on Sunday for the

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,038
the media workshop track I'm actually

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,079
releasing a new tool called danger zone

32
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:43,319
that I'm excited about so you should

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,568
check that out and also I come from a

34
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,609
tech background but I do journalism I

35
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,799
accidentally became a journalist just

36
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:53,520
because I wanted to write about things

37
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:58,829
while I was working at the intercept so

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,619
I'm going to talk about all of the leak

39
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,749
cases the the cases of whistleblowers

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,509
who have gotten arrested and charged

41
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:10,280
since Trump took office in the United

42
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,840
States so far there's eight of them and

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,560
it's very all of these examples are very

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,630
specific to the United States

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,959
but also I think that the lessons are

46
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:24,280
very global because the evidence used

47
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,599
against them is uh I'm gonna go into

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,770
details about all the evidence but the

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,560
evidence is just massive amounts of data

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,360
that leak investigators have access to

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,880
and this is true no matter where you are

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:43,870
this is true anywhere in the world um so

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,329
when so okay so the key thing is that

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,580
sources whistleblowers who decide to

55
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,830
talk to journalists they're not spies

56
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,239
they got charged under the Espionage Act

57
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:57,580
in the United States but they're not

58
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,620
spies they're just normal workers who do

59
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,019
things that you know everybody else does

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,049
like raise your hand if you use a cell

61
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,099
phone

62
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,160
cool that's a lot lower raise your hand

63
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,929
if you have a Google account yeah this

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:17,500
is like most people right everybody

65
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:19,480
maybe um so these workers in during the

66
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,910
course of their job they come across

67
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,340
something really disturbing and they

68
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,350
feel like if they're you know the only

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,739
ethical thing to do is to expose it to

70
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:33,420
try and change things for the better and

71
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:36,670
so the first thing they do is they maybe

72
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,149
sent a text message to a friend or maybe

73
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,339
they do some Google searches or maybe

74
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,819
they if they have access to restricted

75
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,590
databases they look do more searches

76
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,048
than these restricted databases to find

77
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,670
out more information to like you know

78
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,870
make sure that they're right about about

79
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:58,510
what what they're trying to understand

80
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:03,700
so on the government side when a leak

81
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:05,170
investigation starts the the government

82
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,298
first learns about the leak and normally

83
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,608
this happens either when journalists

84
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,260
publish an article and there's secret

85
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:14,260
documents published or secret documents

86
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,238
referenced or when journalists contact

87
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,769
the government for a comment shortly

88
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,839
before they publish their article as

89
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,979
soon as this happens in the United

90
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:26,320
States the FBI starts an investigation

91
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,150
if it's a government government

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,900
leak

93
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,270
and the FBI like the first question they

94
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,219
asked is who access any of these

95
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,349
documents and when and they have a lot

96
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,060
of information and there's other there's

97
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,880
other stuff that they that they start

98
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:48,160
with so what they the information that

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,159
they start out with is everything on

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:56,470
employer owned devices so work computers

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,080
work phones restricted databases the way

102
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,760
that like everything is digital now so

103
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,409
the way that databases work is if you

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,580
have access to some sort of database and

105
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,380
you can find restricted documents like

106
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,330
maybe classified documents in it you

107
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,120
have an account you have a username you

108
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,609
have to log in every search term is is

109
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,919
recorded with like an exact timestamp in

110
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,710
your username every document you access

111
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,659
is recorded if you have a workstation

112
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,810
and you print something from it every

113
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,900
print job is recorded and and stored in

114
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,490
all of this information the FBI starts

115
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,979
with all of this they also start with

116
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,160
any evidence they can gather from work

117
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:42,460
devices from like work email from

118
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,760
anything like that so like for example

119
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,440
if you have a work computer and you use

120
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,699
a web browser on that work computer they

121
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,909
have your browser history from that

122
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:56,740
computer so that's just the beginning

123
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:59,919
the rest of the tech industry all of the

124
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,169
big tech companies their business model

125
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,060
is collecting as much information as

126
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,039
they possibly can on everyone and the

127
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,979
government also has access to all of

128
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,860
this so using court orders and using

129
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,330
search warrants the the US government

130
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,099
certainly has access to a lot of stuff

131
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,630
like this but so does the Indian

132
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:19,229
government so do government's all over

133
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,490
the world so if you use a Google account

134
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,340
Google actually has a transparency

135
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,050
report you can look up to the Google

136
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,960
transparent see your report for India

137
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:33,010
and see exactly how many data requests

138
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,930
make google complies to coming from the

139
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,710
indian government or coming from india

140
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,620
in general so if you use a cell phone

141
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:45,219
the metadata for all of your

142
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:49,030
SMS messages all your phone calls is

143
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,480
available if you use the phone you

144
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,010
probably back it up to iCloud or to your

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,710
Google account the backups of your

146
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,280
phones are available to investigators

147
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:01,060
and pretty much everything else but it's

148
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,450
more than that

149
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,690
it's also once leak investigators get

150
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,060
enough evidence against a potential

151
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,860
source then they can get search warrants

152
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,390
to actually like raid the houses of

153
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,340
sources and search their devices so like

154
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,539
a good example is encrypted messaging

155
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:25,750
apps like signal like whatsapp these are

156
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,750
excellent because their end-to-end

157
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,700
encrypted and so this means that if you

158
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,360
if the government goes signal and says

159
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,770
hey tell me everything about to tell me

160
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,630
all the messages that these two signal

161
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,580
users are sending signal just can't do

162
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,140
that because their encrypted from one of

163
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,390
the users devices to the other users

164
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,789
device but once they're on the device

165
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,010
the they're just protected by that

166
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,720
devices disk encryption and very clearly

167
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:55,480
this does not work very well and so if

168
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,830
you are a suspect and you and your house

169
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,090
gets raided and you got arrested and

170
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,710
they take your phone and then they

171
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,270
search your phone they can gain access

172
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:06,669
to all of those messages okay so when

173
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,650
you think about whistleblowers and when

174
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,650
you think about operational security and

175
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,180
Duke being very good at security and

176
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,820
hiding your tracks a lot of people think

177
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,800
of Edward Snowden but he was actually a

178
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:26,110
really big exception to this because

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,510
unlike almost everybody else he made a

180
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,280
decision early on that there was no way

181
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,590
that he could remain anonymous and so he

182
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,780
decided to come forth publicly with his

183
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,090
name as the source and so he did all

184
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,280
sorts of he took all sorts of steps that

185
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:46,330
were very advanced like one of his jobs

186
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:49,089
was training people in training us like

187
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,040
spies how to evade surveillance in China

188
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,440
so he had a lot of knowledge about

189
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,390
evading surveillance and he used this

190
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,410
knowledge

191
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,870
to blow the whistle but he didn't think

192
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,219
that he would get away with it so rather

193
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:09,330
than you know getting caught eventually

194
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,220
he decided to like go ahead and say his

195
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,340
name and he just used these steps in

196
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,070
order to buy time to make sure that the

197
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,710
information could get out there okay so

198
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,290
with that I'm gonna start talking about

199
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,720
all of the cases of whistleblowers since

200
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,390
Trump took office the first one is

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,220
reality winner

202
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:35,850
she was arrested in 2017 and charged

203
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,560
with espionage she was the first source

204
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,730
that has been charged under the Trump

205
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,890
administration and so she was accused of

206
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,960
leaking an NSA documents she's an NSA

207
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,840
contractor she's accused of leaking a

208
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,890
document to a news organization that has

209
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,930
widely been reported as the intercept

210
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:57,150
that described Russian military

211
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,569
intelligence the GRU a spear phishing

212
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:03,630
campaign trying to hack first an

213
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,910
American election services vendor and

214
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:11,070
then their customers to state election

215
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:14,370
services so this is gonna be a common

216
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:17,730
theme for everyone the document that was

217
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,340
published on the news website was it had

218
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,720
a crease in it and so the leaked

219
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,550
investigators figured it was maybe

220
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,960
printed and they looked at their logs

221
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,319
and they saw that only six people

222
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,170
printed this so immediately the suspect

223
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
pool was six people and they looked into

224
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,479
all six of these people and they found

225
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,520
that winner was the only one who had

226
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,930
email contact with the intercept and the

227
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,590
email had nothing to do with this the

228
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:46,050
email was that she emailed the intercept

229
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,300
asking for a transcript for a podcast

230
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,969
episode but that's enough it just means

231
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,630
that she's an intercept reader or an

232
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,890
intercept consumer and she was one of

233
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,140
these six people so she's the prime

234
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:02,699
suspect but they had way way way more

235
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,290
information they use court orders to get

236
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,020
data from Facebook and Google and

237
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,560
Twitter and AT&T her phone company

238
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,260
and in the United States court orders

239
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,540
take a lot there they're relatively easy

240
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,920
to get search warrants give you a lot

241
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,319
more information but you need to show

242
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,069
probable cause but with court orders you

243
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,260
don't have to do this and so without

244
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,720
needing very much probable cause with a

245
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,750
court order they were able to get

246
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,880
metadata from all of these companies so

247
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,070
for example they got you know all of the

248
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,650
SMS metadata that she had all the phone

249
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,040
calls that she made and all of the

250
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:43,050
emails in her energy mail account the

251
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,130
subjects the to the from just not the

252
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,949
body and then they had a you know like

253
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,080
by getting metadata from her Google

254
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,550
account they saw that she had written an

255
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,140
email to be intercept and then they used

256
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,719
all of this evidence to get a search

257
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,150
warrant to raid her house when they

258
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,270
raided her house they found Kandra and

259
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,860
notes for how to set up like a burner

260
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,640
email address how to set up a burner

261
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,200
phone she was interested in tour and so

262
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,250
and she wrote notes about this and so

263
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,380
they used the fact that she was

264
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:19,650
interested in these technologies as

265
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:22,140
evidence against her they also seized

266
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,240
her computer they seized her phone they

267
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,580
did forensics on it and on her phone

268
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,810
they found that she had a screenshot of

269
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:34,220
a web page that listed the eight secure

270
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:36,959
drop addresses and so secure drop is a

271
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,310
whistle-blower submission system it's

272
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,890
open source actually we're having a

273
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:44,250
hackathon at this conference where we

274
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,630
can work on a fixing bugs and secure top

275
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,870
and adding features if anybody is

276
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,939
interested and media organizations use

277
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,270
it so that sources could more safely

278
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,400
communicate with journalists and so the

279
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,980
fact that she was interested in maybe

280
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:05,069
using secure drop was was used against

281
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:07,590
her and then also they had sent they got

282
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,420
a court order for Facebook for her

283
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,920
Facebook metadata and so they didn't get

284
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,829
content from Facebook they just got

285
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,199
metadata but they got content from the

286
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,330
private app data on her phone so she had

287
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,310
the Facebook app installed they had

288
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,500
access to the private partition and

289
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,060
got the content of messages she sent and

290
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,510
so she they use messages that she sent

291
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,219
to her sister as evidence against her

292
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,870
and then also her browser history there

293
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,150
was a lot of stuff in her browser

294
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:39,330
history that they use the answer like

295
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:42,000
looking for tor email services and also

296
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:45,410
like like search results that she had

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,580
searched for in her browser history um

298
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,760
in her browser history

299
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,339
they say that they found her looking up

300
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,760
the test page for the news organization

301
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,279
that she is accused of sending this

302
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,170
document to and then also the tips page

303
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,150
for a separate news organization at

304
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,400
around the same time she logged into a

305
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,779
Dropbox account and so the investigators

306
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,819
were like what is in this Dropbox

307
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,350
account and so they sent a search

308
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,580
warrant to Dropbox and they also sent a

309
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,350
search warrant to Google and they also

310
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,750
had other search warrants and they got a

311
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,940
massive amount of information like

312
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,860
Dropbox handed over a thumb drive with

313
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,630
everything in her account thumb drive

314
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,630
containing records associated with the

315
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,670
following Dropbox account Google gave

316
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,470
them electronic files in excess of eight

317
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,640
hundred nine megabytes compressed for

318
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:35,550
two different Google accounts that she

319
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:38,010
was using so this is a there's just a

320
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,670
massive trove of information and it's

321
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,470
really difficult for people to even be

322
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,579
aware that all of this data is being

323
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,730
collected okay so Terry L Bray he is the

324
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,850
second whistleblower that the Trump

325
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,230
administration has filed charges with

326
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,520
he's also being charged under the

327
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:03,180
Espionage Act he was the only black FBI

328
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:07,020
agent in Minneapolis he was like a

329
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,969
victim of a lot of racism and he

330
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,709
basically witnessed what what he

331
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,580
considered to be human rights violations

332
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:18,599
it in the FBI the FBI was had systemic

333
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,190
biases they were abusing informants they

334
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,740
were basically like finding people who

335
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,089
were undocumented or whose family

336
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,920
members are undocumented and say you

337
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,150
have to like tell us about your

338
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,490
relatives or

339
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,850
people in your community or we're gonna

340
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,960
you know get your relatives deported

341
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:39,240
they also you know investigated

342
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,580
minorities like Muslims and and and

343
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,830
black people spied on journalists and he

344
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:50,310
had access to a lot of documents about

345
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:52,260
all of us so like with reality winner of

346
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,609
the 27 to oh then the news organization

347
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,480
that he's accused of leaking to is also

348
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,600
the intercept of the 27 documents that

349
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,810
were published he was one of 16 people

350
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,000
who access one of them and so he was one

351
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,849
of the the suspects and so of those 16

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,720
people he had access over two-thirds of

353
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:16,170
those documents and what's interesting

354
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,820
about his case is that they seems to

355
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:22,890
have a lot of very specific actions that

356
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,110
he did on his FBI workstation so

357
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:28,410
apparently the workstations of the FBI

358
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,660
can tell exactly when you take

359
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,930
screenshots and paste them into an Excel

360
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,670
document and when you print the Excel

361
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,859
document even if you haven't saved it

362
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,199
and it doesn't have a file name yet so

363
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,910
they have like very specific like

364
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,210
timestamps of when these actions took

365
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,800
place and then in this case there was

366
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,220
also security footage there was a

367
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,709
security camera in his workplace that

368
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,500
says that on three different times they

369
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,180
captured footage of him putting an SD

370
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,040
card in a digital camera and taking

371
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,270
photographs of his screen and there was

372
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,550
other stuff like that but like in

373
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:09,379
situations like this it is incredibly

374
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:11,609
hard to to get information out of of

375
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,440
organizations like the FBI it's like

376
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:18,958
it's very difficult okay the next person

377
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,270
the third person is James Wolfe he

378
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,980
worked for the US Senate Intelligence

379
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:31,260
Committee and he was accused of leaking

380
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:35,100
information about a Trump adviser Carter

381
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:38,100
page and a Russian spy trying to recruit

382
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,389
em she wasn't actually charged with that

383
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,209
he was charged with lying to

384
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,919
investigators

385
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,330
the FBI had interviewed him asked him if

386
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,130
he spoke to any journalists and he said

387
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,570
no but the first thing they did was look

388
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,010
through his work email and they found

389
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,918
five emails that he had sent from his

390
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,260
working email with a journalist and then

391
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,299
also it's unclear exactly how they know

392
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,470
this but throughout the affidavits and

393
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:04,539
indictments they talked about him

394
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,429
meeting in person at various places with

395
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:11,289
with various journalists they also got a

396
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,450
court order for his phone records they

397
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:14,890
found lots of SMS messages lots of phone

398
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,090
calls that he had with various

399
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:22,179
journalists but the biggest thing is

400
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,220
that they actually quoted the content of

401
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:26,020
signal messages and I remember when this

402
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,730
story broke out there were all these

403
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,960
conspiracy theories about how signal has

404
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,610
been hacked but the only and the legal

405
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,710
documents don't say how they got this

406
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,229
information but the the only reasonable

407
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,429
explanation is they searched his phone

408
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:44,860
and so like for example after the story

409
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,779
was published wolf congratulated to the

410
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,729
reporter using signal stating good job

411
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,049
I'm glad you got the scoop and the

412
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,779
reporter wrote back thank you and

413
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:55,539
encrypted signal messages so if you're

414
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,049
using signal and you're talking to a

415
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,390
reporter

416
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,139
make sure to delete those messages as

417
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:06,429
soon as you touch okay

418
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:09,429
Joshua salt he is the next person under

419
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:11,200
the Trump administration he's also

420
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:14,200
charged with espionage

421
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,789
he's accused of leaking vault 7 to

422
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,899
WikiLeaks which is a collection of CIA

423
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,570
hacking tools

424
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:23,860
he was a CA software developer and also

425
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:27,370
his case is like different than the rest

426
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,500
because like when he during the leak

427
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,350
investigation they found a bunch of

428
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,980
child sexual abuse images on his

429
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:38,549
computer and a bunch of other really

430
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:43,539
like gross stuff with this person but

431
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:47,710
but like everybody else there was so the

432
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:51,399
FBI concluded that the data that was

433
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,919
leaked and sent to WikiLeaks was taken

434
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,209
from a backup server and he was only one

435
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,150
of

436
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:01,440
people with access to that backup server

437
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,760
and then after WikiLeaks published all

438
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,830
of this data

439
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,540
he used a phone number a Google Voice

440
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,010
phone number and sent hundreds of text

441
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,070
messages to his colleagues at the CIA

442
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:16,160
and called people of the CIA all using

443
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:19,950
Google Voice talking about the leak and

444
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,430
so this was used as evidence to get a

445
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:26,460
search warrant from Google and and then

446
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,010
also there was like a discussion on a

447
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,440
reddit thread where he had actually

448
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,240
taken some of the source code from a CIA

449
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,130
hacking tool and just uploaded it to his

450
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,760
github account so they also got search

451
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,900
warrants for reddit and forget and when

452
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,120
they got the results of their search

453
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,970
warrant back there was a lot of

454
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,500
incriminating Google searches because if

455
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,090
you're logged in to a Google search and

456
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,070
you're a Google account and you search

457
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,600
stuff all of your search terms are being

458
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,419
recorded and this is not the first

459
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,510
person who records of their Google

460
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:02,670
searches directly from Google has been

461
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:05,670
used against them so like wall the

462
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,230
unlike the day that they that the

463
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,240
investigators believe the data was

464
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,400
copied he was doing all these cool

465
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,870
searches about how to efficiently copy

466
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,460
large amounts of files and then he also

467
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,320
searched for WikiLeaks many many times

468
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,930
read lots of articles about WikiLeaks

469
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,689
search for things like Assange search

470
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:27,000
for things like tales the operating

471
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,370
system that helps you be anonymous he

472
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,200
actually also searched for how to delete

473
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:36,479
your Google search history but didn't

474
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,220
delete it apparently okay so the next

475
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,540
person is Natalie Mayflower Stowers

476
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:45,330
Edwards she worked with the Treasury

477
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,690
Department the Financial Crimes Division

478
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,919
of it and the Financial Crimes Division

479
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,630
they have these documents called

480
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,340
suspicious activity reports so when

481
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:58,440
there's bank transfers that are very

482
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:00,899
suspicious that the u.s. thinks is like

483
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,550
some sort of like illegal activity maybe

484
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,610
or maybe money laundering or something

485
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,530
like that they have these reports and so

486
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,039
she is accused of leaking a bunch of

487
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,229
these

488
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:15,330
suspicious activity reports to BuzzFeed

489
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,279
and these all involve a Republican

490
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,749
people who are associated with the

491
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,149
Republican Party in the United States

492
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:23,909
and people associated with Trump's 2016

493
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:26,100
presidential campaign and all of these

494
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:29,309
really sketchy financial transactions

495
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,019
between Russian officials and oligarchs

496
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,408
and things like this

497
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:37,139
and the interesting thing about her case

498
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,100
is they got a special type of court

499
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:41,070
order called a pen register

500
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,519
trap-and-trace so in the United States a

501
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,349
pen register is you've got a pen

502
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,210
register against a device and that

503
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:51,330
allows the government to collect

504
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:54,419
metadata about that communications

505
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,949
device but it doesn't actually say

506
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:58,710
technically how that could happen

507
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,349
so if you got a pen register order

508
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,440
against a phone you can use a stingray

509
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:06,539
and intercept the data from that phone

510
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,249
and as long as you're just collecting

511
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:12,570
metadata that's fine but if they used a

512
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:15,899
stingray they wouldn't be able to

513
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,489
collect metadata from an encrypted

514
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:21,748
messaging app but in this case they used

515
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:23,700
a pen register and it says like within

516
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:25,889
approximately six hours after the pen

517
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,629
register became operative and the day

518
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:29,008
after one of the articles was published

519
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:31,019
Edwards cell phone exchanged

520
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:32,340
approximately 70 messages via an

521
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:34,109
encrypted application with the reporter

522
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,720
so they they were able to get real-time

523
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:41,369
metadata from an encrypted messaging app

524
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,940
and there was like quite a lot like

525
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:46,559
there's 541 messages exchanged files

526
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,239
were transferred using this messaging

527
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:53,999
app so I asked Moxie Marlinspike from

528
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:55,979
signal if they were maybe using signal

529
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:59,309
and he said they were not using signals

530
00:23:55,979 --> 00:24:02,489
signal has only responded to one data

531
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:05,190
request and the information is on

532
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:08,190
signals website about that and signal is

533
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,929
engineered to record to have access to

534
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:15,179
as little information as possible about

535
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:18,840
its users and signal does doesn't

536
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,870
respond to trap-and-trace records are

537
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,280
orders so I was thinking maybe it was

538
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,620
whatsapp I asked what's up and they

539
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,240
wouldn't comment but they did point me

540
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,520
to their frequently asked questions for

541
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,740
law enforcement that says what's that

542
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,150
may collect use preserve and share user

543
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,440
information if we have a good faith

544
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,600
believe that it's reasonably necessary

545
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,700
to respond to legal process order

546
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,080
government requests and whatsapp is

547
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,890
owned by Facebook and Facebook has a

548
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,030
transparency report which actually says

549
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,150
publishes information about how many

550
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,860
data requests they comply with and they

551
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,440
have a section for pen register shop and

552
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:56,219
trace and in the second half of 2018

553
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,680
when this one happened Facebook got

554
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,300
sixth out got requests for six thousand

555
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,580
one hundred ninety three different

556
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,360
accounts and they complied with 92% of

557
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,590
them so I don't know for sure that this

558
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,750
was what's up but I think it was

559
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,580
probably what's up and I think that the

560
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,180
key thing to know about whatsapp is your

561
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,970
metadata is in no way secure and that if

562
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,850
you are you know talking to a journalist

563
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,130
using whatsapp it's entirely possible

564
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,110
that all of that communicate all of the

565
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,160
metadata about that communication could

566
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:31,080
be just getting sent to the FBI um and

567
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,540
then also in this case they got a search

568
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,820
warrant for her Google account and her

569
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,920
Google search history showed her the day

570
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,480
after an article was published searching

571
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,970
for the headline of the article and then

572
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,410
clicking it and this was used as

573
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,590
evidence that maybe she was the source

574
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:48,810
for this article and then and then they

575
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,280
also got a search warrant for her phone

576
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,370
they seized her phone and got the

577
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:57,000
content of the text note of the

578
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:58,860
encrypted messages as well and they

579
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,870
seized a flash drive and found twenty

580
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,909
four thousand five files on it there

581
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:07,860
were specific suspicious activity

582
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:11,430
reports and this was just more more

583
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,729
evidence okay so the next person John

584
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:19,560
fry he also had access to suspicious

585
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:22,550
financial transactions and he is accused

586
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,350
of leaking the documents that showed

587
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,820
that Donald Trump paid one hundred

588
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,730
thirty thousand dollars of hush money to

589
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,710
a pornstar stormy Daniels in exchange

590
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,390
for her staying silent about their

591
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:38,830
affair

592
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:40,330
so he had access to multiple restricted

593
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,790
databases including one run by a

594
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:47,050
Palantir which is a surveillance company

595
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:48,639
and just like all of these databases if

596
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,560
you have an account on the database

597
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,690
everything that you do every search term

598
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,669
every act document you access and

599
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,350
download is all being logged with your

600
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:00,250
username and your timestamp and so he

601
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,090
conducted a bunch of searches about

602
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,820
Michael Cohen who is Trump's lawyer and

603
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,189
fixer and found a bunch of suspicious

604
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,860
financial transactions that Michael

605
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,940
Cohen was making he downloaded some of

606
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:18,820
them they searched his work computer

607
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:20,800
found those files and then they also got

608
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,620
a court order for his phone metadata and

609
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,690
right after downloading them he called

610
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,350
someone that turned out to be Michael

611
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:33,580
Evan @e who was the lawyer who ended up

612
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:36,280
representing stormy Daniels and then he

613
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,659
also used the FinCEN database which is

614
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,870
the same database that Edwards had

615
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,210
access to and they logs everything in

616
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,830
the same ways and he did a bunch of

617
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:49,690
searches related to Michael Cohen there

618
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:54,669
and he also made phone calls to a

619
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:56,200
reporter and and then eventually they

620
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,060
got a search warrant to seize his phone

621
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,370
they searched his phone they saw well

622
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,710
what's up messages he sent and they saw

623
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,840
the content of the whatsapp messages

624
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,970
including him saying thank you

625
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:12,909
beautifully and after an article was

626
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:16,120
published okay so the next person Daniel

627
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:20,710
Hale he is a peace activist he's a like

628
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,429
outspoken a like member of Veterans

629
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,770
Against the War

630
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:26,260
he's a drone whistleblower he worked for

631
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:29,080
five years in the u.s. drone

632
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,540
assassination program part of his job

633
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,760
was actually picking out targets to be

634
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:41,790
assassinated by drone strike and in 2019

635
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:44,020
he was charged with espionage for

636
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,909
leaking documents about the drone

637
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,550
program

638
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:52,660
so he also it's been reported that the

639
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,070
news room that he leaked to was the

640
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,170
intercept and that the specific

641
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,300
journalists that he talked to was Jeremy

642
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,150
Scahill who is one of the founders of

643
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,810
the intercept and so and this all

644
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:08,530
happened a long time ago so in 2013 they

645
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:10,000
searched his he had multiple work

646
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,710
computers he had an unclassified work

647
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,570
computer that had access to the internet

648
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,780
he used that computer and searched for

649
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,220
this journalist and he found a book tour

650
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,870
anytime this journalist was on a book

651
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,000
tour and there was a book signing event

652
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:26,649
at a bookstore and the affidavit says

653
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,390
that he met in Perth he went to this

654
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,390
event met the journalist in person and

655
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:34,510
then shortly after that he like sent a

656
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:39,610
text message to a friend talking about

657
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:43,270
this and then they got so in this case

658
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:45,209
they actually got probably a wiretap of

659
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,650
his phone because they have not not only

660
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,120
the metadata of his text messages but

661
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:53,620
they also have the content of his text

662
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,320
messages and so like they have the

663
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,639
reporter asking Hale to set up a jabber

664
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,439
account so they could have an encrypted

665
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,240
conversation this is 2013 this is before

666
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,010
there were encrypted messaging apps this

667
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,020
was the one it was kind of hard to have

668
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,550
encrypted conversations with people now

669
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,940
you can just use signal and it's it's

670
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,500
much much simpler and I'm not sure

671
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,270
exactly how they got this information

672
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,460
but they say that between these two

673
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:19,410
dates Hale and the reporter had at least

674
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,410
three encrypted conversations via jabber

675
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:26,950
then they also searched his classified

676
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:30,610
work computer they saw that he printed

677
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,380
secret and top secret documents and like

678
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:36,219
hours after that he sent a text message

679
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,840
to the journalist and in 2014 Argus 2014

680
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,450
the FBI raided his house and they

681
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:45,159
searched they seized his computer and

682
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:48,160
thumb drives one of the thumb drives was

683
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,800
had a deleted file on it which means it

684
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,670
wasn't securely wiped but they were able

685
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,800
to recover it that was a secret file and

686
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,080
the other another thumb drive had tails

687
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,779
on it there was no evidence that they

688
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,789
managed to

689
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:03,820
get any information from his tail but

690
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:06,440
just the fact that he was using tails is

691
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,779
used as evidence against him

692
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,999
and I think that one of the most

693
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,039
interesting things about Daniel Hale is

694
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:16,340
that all of this stuff happened under

695
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,809
the Obama administration and the Obama

696
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,090
administration apparently decided not to

697
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,678
prosecute him maybe it has to do with

698
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,259
the fact that Obama was widely

699
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,779
criticized for the drone program but

700
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:28,369
five years later the Trump

701
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:32,570
administration revived the case and

702
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:34,789
charged him with espionage and then okay

703
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,039
this is the last one Henry Kyle fries

704
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,629
this is just a few months ago he works

705
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,429
for the DIA

706
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:43,759
he's the counterterrorism analyst and

707
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:45,499
he's accused of providing information

708
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:50,479
about a foreign country's weapon systems

709
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:51,409
to two different reporters so like

710
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:55,669
everybody else

711
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:59,059
only 26 people had access to the secret

712
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:01,159
documents and so he was one of them and

713
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:03,168
then the first thing they did is they

714
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:04,969
looked at these 26 people and looked at

715
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:08,119
their social media presence and they

716
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:10,369
discovered that Frese was following the

717
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:12,070
journalist on Twitter and the journalist

718
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:14,869
was following him back on Twitter and

719
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:20,059
then they did other and in this case the

720
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:23,209
journalist was a Courtney know Amanda

721
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:25,519
Mack yes and they did public records

722
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,589
requests and found that priests and

723
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,570
Amanda Macheath share the same home

724
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:37,009
address and based on their social media

725
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:38,928
it looks like they were dating and so

726
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:40,369
they did a court order for his phone

727
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:41,869
records and they saw that he had

728
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:43,699
hundreds of phone calls with her a lot

729
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,539
of text messages with her and then the

730
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,950
other journalist

731
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:48,169
that he's accused of leaking to he has

732
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:52,639
lots of phone calls and hundreds of text

733
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:55,460
messages with and so they got a search

734
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:58,609
warrant for twitter twitter returned the

735
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,789
content of their direct messages and the

736
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,989
journalist wrote a direct message to him

737
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:05,089
asking if he'd be willing to speak with

738
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:07,429
the other journalist and he said he was

739
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,809
down to help and this is kind of

740
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:10,220
remarkable because they lived in the

741
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,019
same house they didn't need to send

742
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,520
Twitter direct messages they could have

743
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:18,110
just talked

744
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,700
but but I think this is like kind of

745
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,429
highlights the problem is that people

746
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,220
even people with security clearances who

747
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,080
work for the Defense Intelligence Agency

748
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,580
don't have a concept to everything we do

749
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,500
is under surveillance that everyone is

750
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,899
being spied on that if you use phones at

751
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,870
all if you use computers at all there's

752
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:39,980
a record and that the FBI can get access

753
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:42,830
to it and then when the journalist

754
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:47,110
published an article based on the leaf

755
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:50,570
documents freeze retweeted the article

756
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:54,919
and then also what's interesting about

757
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:56,540
the court order for AT&T is they

758
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,730
actually got his location data not just

759
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,220
the metadata for his messages when he

760
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:05,180
made a phone call with the second

761
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,330
journalist they are saying that he made

762
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,639
that phone call from his office at work

763
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,918
and so keep in mind if you carry a cell

764
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,040
phone you're you don't have any location

765
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:20,690
privacy okay

766
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,239
so what are the big takeaways so the

767
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,870
first everybody is under surveillance

768
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,279
everything that we do is under

769
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,540
surveillance this is just like a new

770
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,389
world that we live in and there's

771
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:32,570
nothing that it's like really hard for

772
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:35,060
us to do anything about this it's really

773
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:38,510
great that it's easy now for people to

774
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,969
talk to journalists using encrypted

775
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,010
messaging apps this has like made things

776
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:47,719
way way way better but it's not nearly

777
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:49,639
enough if the the messages still are on

778
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,589
people's phones people will still aren't

779
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,840
aware that like you know if you're using

780
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:57,460
what's up all of your metadata could be

781
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,260
available to investigators and just

782
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:03,620
everything that happens is being

783
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,600
recorded if you went to a website two

784
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,520
months ago on your phone there's a

785
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,700
record of that maybe clear your browser

786
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,640
history um and I think the biggest thing

787
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,220
is that this is not a problem that's

788
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,650
easy to solve this is a problem with how

789
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,700
our society works right now and there's

790
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,990
no easy fix and really because

791
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,779
whistleblowers are just ordinary people

792
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,870
they are not trained in being

793
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,890
able to get around this surveillance

794
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:36,049
like Edward Snowden was they don't have

795
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,640
these skill sets the only way to protect

796
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:41,570
whistleblowers is to just protect

797
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,629
everybody we need to make it so that the

798
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,670
like you know phones that people use the

799
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,100
software that people use like web like

800
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:52,460
tech companies need to have less data

801
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,660
everywhere about everything and and just

802
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,220
making it so that everybody has more

803
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,810
privacy by default it's really the best

804
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,209
thing that we can do but it's a very

805
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:04,250
it's a very hard problem yeah that that

806
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,840
is it thank you so much I don't I think

807
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:27,290
we're running late but I don't know if

808
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:31,070
we have time for Weston you spoke about

809
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:35,390
or you mentioned some apps and tools to

810
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:37,340
use to ensure interpret communication to

811
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,740
safeguard us from surveillance after

812
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,650
that that's a technology aspects of it

813
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:49,100
whatever the legal acts both legal

814
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:51,140
aspects so I'm not very familiar with

815
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,790
law outside of the United States but in

816
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,279
the United States there's nothing

817
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:58,820
illegal about encryption you're you have

818
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,480
you're allowed to do stuff privately

819
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:05,240
like it it's illegal to share classified

820
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,820
documents maybe but it's not necessarily

821
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,430
unethical to in many cases is ethical to

822
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,200
share classified documents but in terms

823
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,990
of just using the technology in terms of

824
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,910
just talking to people using encryption

825
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,080
talking to people anonymously and the

826
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,080
United States it's completely illegal

827
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,560
any other question

828
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:41,890
yeah so you spoke about signal messages

829
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,380
being you know extracted from the device

830
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:48,310
right so wouldn't that require physical

831
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:51,040
access to the device and the encryption

832
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,500
to be lifted off by the owner of the

833
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,000
device so is he supposed to comply with

834
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,280
the FBI and you know give him his

835
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,900
passcode or how does that work yeah so

836
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,940
in order to get signal messages from

837
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:06,010
devices they need physical access to the

838
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:07,360
device yeah and like I mean it is also

839
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,910
possible the device could be hacked

840
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,770
remotely and and the data can be stolen

841
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:13,899
from it but in the but in all of these

842
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,520
cases they had physical access because

843
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,710
they like raided their houses and

844
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,340
arrested them and took their phone and

845
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:24,880
then in terms of disk encryption

846
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:27,340
yeah like phones these days most phones

847
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,620
that are new have disk encryption and

848
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:33,070
the encryption is as strong as your

849
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:36,850
passcode but a lot of people have really

850
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:38,650
weak settings and and in many cases this

851
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,870
can be defeated and also in many cases a

852
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,520
court can order someone to unlock their

853
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,470
phone for investigators and then they

854
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,690
have an extra choice of like okay do I

855
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,189
want to like go to jail for a long time

856
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,450
for contempt of court or do I want to

857
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,660
just comply because they're gonna get in

858
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:55,180
anyway okay thanks yeah it's a it's a

859
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,490
hard problem I don't think I used to

860
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,069
weigh more think that disk encryption

861
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:03,009
would protect people and I think it does

862
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:05,290
protect people to an extent but I think

863
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,730
that you need to you need to does not

864
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:12,730
have data you need to delete your

865
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:15,640
messages about that I mean I'm talking

866
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,470
about I'm curious because most of the

867
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,770
NSA and all people they don't know about

868
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:22,509
the stuffs like privacy and dr. go or

869
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,460
something like that because I'm just

870
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:27,040
curious because they should know about

871
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,780
these and why they're well why they are

872
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,490
not even using those kind of stuff I

873
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:36,430
mean I think that I think that people

874
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:38,799
who you know our contractors for the NSA

875
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,690
and other things and or the CIA or

876
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,130
whatever and they're doing Google

877
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,569
searches whether they're locked logged

878
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,670
into their Google account and

879
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:47,979
using DuckDuckGo I mean I think that

880
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,989
it's the same reason why Google is much

881
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:53,189
more popular than DuckDuckGo in the

882
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:56,170
larger society right people like like

883
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,759
the defaults the things that every bit

884
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,940
like the majority of almost everybody

885
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:03,789
uses are not private at all and I don't

886
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,440
think that just because you work for an

887
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:06,849
intelligence agency means that you're

888
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,029
more likely to use one of the private

889
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:12,369
options and I think that's the problem

890
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:15,160
like if Google didn't record your search

891
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:17,349
history by default if that setting was

892
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,910
just turned off by default then a lot of

893
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:24,729
people would not be in prison right now

894
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:26,739
I mean I have two questions for you one

895
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:29,379
is from the Pegasus attack we've seen

896
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:31,900
how devices were compromised using a

897
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:35,709
zero-day in the whatsapp video calling

898
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:38,079
facility and from our understanding once

899
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:41,078
Pegasus is on your device you can't

900
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,839
remove it so the phone is going to be

901
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,390
permanently compromised so is that

902
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,400
correct or is there a defense against

903
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,180
Pegasus kind of an attack that's my

904
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,299
first question

905
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:55,569
the second is meta data especially

906
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:58,989
location data for example today's iPhone

907
00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:00,699
or or phones which have their batteries

908
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:03,069
which can't be taken out even if you

909
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:05,289
switch off the phone I believe it will

910
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:07,900
still continue to have some sort of

911
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:09,579
location data on it even when you're

912
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,499
traveling with a switched off phone is

913
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:13,209
there a protection against that to

914
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:16,538
protect your sources um

915
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:18,549
I mean so the protection against the

916
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:20,709
real protection against location data is

917
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:22,839
don't use a phone maybe use an iPod

918
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:24,759
touch it doesn't have GPS but it still

919
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:26,410
has Wi-Fi and there's still location

920
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:28,180
data because Wi-Fi access points are

921
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,410
connected to could you here to have

922
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:33,519
location data but that's that's better

923
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,949
but yeah I mean I think this is one of

924
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,718
the fundamental problems cell phones

925
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:39,369
were designed without location privacy

926
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:41,680
that's just how they were built that's

927
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:43,599
just how they exist now it's possible to

928
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,930
engineer cell phones in such a way that

929
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,670
there's location privacy but you need to

930
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,219
completely upgrade the entire cell phone

931
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,479
network for this to work and nobody is

932
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:53,829
interested in it because the

933
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,299
government's really like having everyone

934
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:56,800
being tracked

935
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,970
and then your first question about

936
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,650
Pegasus is I mean this problem isn't

937
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:08,520
unique to Pegasus I think Pegasus is

938
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:12,280
like a well-known a piece of malware but

939
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:14,230
but really like whenever there's any

940
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,890
attacker that uses a zero-day to

941
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:23,260
compromise your device and puts malware

942
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:24,460
on your device it's really hard to to do

943
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,890
anything about it I mean your best

944
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:30,610
defense really is just always install

945
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:33,370
updates as soon as they come out try and

946
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:36,460
make it so your device is vulnerable for

947
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,890
the shortest amount of time I do think

948
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,470
that factory resetting your phone on a

949
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,900
regular basis is really helpful it's

950
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,279
possible that somehow I don't know the

951
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,900
details about Pegasus it's possible that

952
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,200
some malware could survive a factory

953
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:53,050
reset but most malware doesn't even for

954
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,540
like iOS rebooting your phone often did

955
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:57,490
like like sometimes your phone could get

956
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,470
hacked but there's no way for the

957
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:03,160
malware to persist so if you reboot the

958
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:05,799
malware is gone so rebooting factory

959
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:14,470
resetting on a regular basis is you know

960
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:17,110
getting a new phone sometimes hello from

961
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:21,040
a philosophical point of view I would

962
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:23,890
like to know your opinion on an FBI at

963
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,940
you making use of a stingray attack on a

964
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:30,040
vessel blower versus the legality of a

965
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,540
whistleblower trying to expose some

966
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,880
critical document which could really

967
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,920
hamper the country's defense or

968
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,560
something like that so your question is

969
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,360
what's the like ethics of a

970
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,690
whistleblower the former from an ethical

971
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:46,420
point of view what do you feel what's

972
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:48,370
your opinion if you look at it from the

973
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,350
government's perspective maybe they are

974
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:53,770
doing right if you look at it from the

975
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:56,110
perspective of the right aspect maybe

976
00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:00,340
the person who is doing it is always

977
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:03,370
right yeah I think I think that I think

978
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,330
that there's just with with ethical

979
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,009
questions like this it's always

980
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,490
case-by-case it really depends on what

981
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,740
it's about

982
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,000
and

983
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,850
and I feel like you know there's

984
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,860
definitely good important work that the

985
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:17,380
FBI does and secrets that are important

986
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,119
for them to keep secret but there's all

987
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,700
but also like you know if they're doing

988
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,320
this two steps like systematically

989
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,210
violate rights of every one of a certain

990
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,180
religion or something like that I feel

991
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:30,010
like it's ethical to expose that I feel

992
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,680
like there's there's greater good

993
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:34,540
happening if you expose that stuff in

994
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,310
terms of legality

995
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:40,350
it's it's definitely illegal hello sir

996
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:46,270
hello

997
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:48,250
oh yeah secure drop and tour are both

998
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:50,920
pieces of software that we will be

999
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:55,300
working on at the hackathon here if

1000
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,750
anybody wants to come yeah so so simply

1001
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,100
means it if you want to be visible over

1002
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:02,230
twice you need to learn how to become

1003
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,190
visible over isn't it yeah and how do

1004
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:07,350
you learn to become a whistleblower

1005
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:09,880
without doing a Google search yeah okay

1006
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:13,509
yeah and that's the hard problem is that

1007
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,070
I there's like some stuff that there's

1008
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,950
some projects that are being worked on

1009
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:19,960
that will make this easier like I don't

1010
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,930
know the current state of it but Firefox

1011
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,330
is working on building tor browser

1012
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,640
directly into Firefox so if you have

1013
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,650
Firefox you go to like super private

1014
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,730
browsing mode and then you're anonymous

1015
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,710
and you can do searches and then it's

1016
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,270
like actually anonymous as opposed to

1017
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,180
just normal private browsing mode or

1018
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,890
incognito mode and there's things and so

1019
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,450
like if people actually use this when

1020
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,020
they're searching for how to be a

1021
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,950
whistleblower

1022
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,600
it'll help but yeah it's a really hard

1023
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,910
problem how are you going to do research

1024
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,250
on the internet about how to be safe

1025
00:45:48,910 --> 00:46:08,500
safely before you know that information

1026
00:45:51,250 --> 00:46:09,340
and it's just an unsolved problem okay

1027
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,100
okay

1028
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,350
