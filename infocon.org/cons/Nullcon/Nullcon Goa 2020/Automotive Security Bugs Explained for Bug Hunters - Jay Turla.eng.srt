1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,360
good more odds

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,210
good afternoon to everyone it is 12:15 I

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,090
think yeah so I'm talking about

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,099
automotive security bugs explain for bug

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:25,439
hunters and it's more on an initiative

6
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:30,630
to promote people to hack for cars and

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:34,350
also to know how we prioritize bugs or

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:40,500
cars or other modern so my name is J

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:43,070
Birla that's my handle and they told me

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,140
that my name is Jacob cheekily from

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:50,130
Kingham because I've seen that will be

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:55,470
my Indian friends so I work as a sac ops

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:58,500
manager for background and in my hobby

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:04,140
and a fellow hacker I also help organize

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,579
record in the Philippines and then also

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,850
the CFP Review Board

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:12,029
so I see a lot of submissions from

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,428
different hackers as well the research

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,590
and also some good Indian security

20
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:18,060
research

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,990
Indians are really close to my heart

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,790
because I have a lot of friends

23
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:28,189
there'd be in their field and also I'm

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,630
not the author of Birla malware I'm

25
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,449
pretty sure that you guys heard

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,869
I'm not even Russian I'm Filipino so

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,149
that's do you know yeah so I also

28
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:42,409
organize the car hacking village I had

29
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:46,369
the car hacking village in Asia and also

30
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:48,439
in Richmond and I have a friend also is

31
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,210
good in car hacking in India his name is

32
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:55,850
Howard money and I thank him for

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:58,639
bringing me here action so I'm also I

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,649
love contributing to security tools you

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,810
might have seen from about modules I

36
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:06,170
have created for Metasploit and I've

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:10,580
also contributed some Metasploit module

38
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:17,120
related to car happy and I am your time

39
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:22,430
I don't know if I pronounced it right so

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,010
yeah well why why KY car hacking oh yes

41
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,530
I forgot I'm from kita proud if I that's

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:32,328
right right yeah bug browser either bro

43
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,780
and then hits car hacking is fun it's

44
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:39,470
really fun there's a good community

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,750
there's a good community and DEF CON hit

46
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,200
other countries as well in fact in India

47
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,670
you also have a car hacking village as

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,890
well from our own money

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:53,450
the guy from is the founder of

50
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:56,268
immunitech and because car hacking is we

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,970
use it every day right we want to ensure

52
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:05,329
that we are safe from attackers

53
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:07,670
or total takeover the good thing about

54
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,250
cars is that it also has a lot of

55
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,350
attacks circuited but when you say

56
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,639
attack services it's your point of entry

57
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,608
take for example in the house they're

58
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:20,090
like two doors and then that's what the

59
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:22,639
thief seemed right but a hacker he also

60
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,740
sees the when the windows have attacked

61
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,380
an entry point okay

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,480
so basically in bum crowd we have my

63
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,500
other computer is your computer but for

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,750
cars my other computer is your car to me

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,750
because cars are like they have

66
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:44,220
infotainment systems and it's like

67
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,130
buying a very expensive computer so her

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,810
hacking bug Bosch's pay well we have

69
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,519
launched batches for cars and the good

70
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,630
thing is that if you're into IOT

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,820
security you could you could even though

72
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,859
you don't know about canvas you could

73
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,739
actually hack for half the infotainment

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,300
system forever Gateway for cars take for

75
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,560
example the telematics the infotainment

76
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,440
the one that you can see from your

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,450
dashboard so yup him the last year we

78
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,070
actually paid two hundred twenty four

79
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,039
thousand USD bug bounties just worked

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:30,030
hard okay

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:33,780
and if you want to start about car

82
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,090
hacking please don't don't forget about

83
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,510
this book it's the car hacker's handbook

84
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,840
you need to search for google and if the

85
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:46,430
online version is free and if you want

86
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,070
to buy the paperback it's it cost like

87
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,830
$25 or fifteen not sure but if you get

88
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,620
like Humble Bundle that you can have a

89
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,090
lot of books together with it so and if

90
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,640
you see if you have a paperback in if

91
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,590
you see Craig Smith from any other

92
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,860
conference you could let him sign the

93
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,570
book thank you so that's breaks me that

94
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,610
was this was written salt so our

95
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,360
conference exists for like 14 years

96
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,360
ready and

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,970
that's him talking in OT and we gave him

98
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,630
some shots - it's in the Philippines you

99
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,930
get a lot of shot use this video and

100
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:26,510
then in this book these are the most

101
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,150
common attack purposes so I'm just

102
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,050
talking about I'll just talk about the

103
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,919
known bugs

104
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,840
for example cellular Wi-Fi Bluetooth

105
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,900
TPMS or a tire pressure monitoring

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,659
system of the car you have the KS and

107
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,120
then for internal when you say internal

108
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,250
that's the thing that you can see inside

109
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,010
of the car so you have the infotainment

110
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,320
the nav console for everything that you

111
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,719
can touch to like interact with the

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,349
navigation those are internal

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,540
so you have the USB as an attack purpose

114
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,270
as well I'll show you a demo and then

115
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,840
you have the obd2 connector so by

116
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:09,919
default obdd connectors are at the down

117
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,890
everything the steering wheel is under

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,480
under the steering wheel so OBD means

119
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:20,210
onboard diagnostics and actually this is

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,970
a sample of it so say for example you

121
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,700
could if you have a elm327 which allows

122
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,390
you to do basically a plastics you can

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:33,760
put you can put it in the obd2 so it

124
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:36,979
could also be near your hand brakes

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,630
it depends actually on the heart but for

126
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,710
most modern cars that I've seen is

127
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:46,580
usually under the steering wheel and

128
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:49,070
come to think of it opt to is internal

129
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,440
right and it travels on cambot the

130
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,820
transmission there's 10 button death so

131
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,250
how do we attack the for if we're

132
00:06:52,820 --> 00:07:00,969
outside the path there are many ways you

133
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:03,620
can let the people attack taste a pub or

134
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,170
you could rip off some of the brake

135
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,560
light or your sensors and if you just

136
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:12,290
use a multi tasker's and then find one

137
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,820
point one point 5 volts you can see that

138
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:19,760
there's can bus 20 so

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,099
yeah those are dia things that you can

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,159
see on a modern car so you have

141
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:30,770
telematics you have HVAC keyless entry

142
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:33,200
so it's getting it's getting them all

143
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,680
this very famous right now it's a trend

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,380
right now it's keyless entry so this I

145
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,540
can't see I can't say a car

146
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,530
manufacturing company when there was a

147
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:51,920
time in the Philippines during the 2000

148
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:53,750
every Toyota every Co Dakar that that

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,200
has this key fob

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,820
I can't say what who is the maker of

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,330
that people by means nothing I'm a

152
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:07,940
hatchery but if you push the key fob

153
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:10,400
together you can actually cause or to

154
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,850
get duplication of [ __ ] Eva Eva

155
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,130
there was like 30,000 people so not you

156
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:20,630
have access to someone's heart and your

157
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,250
heart as there is no explanation how was

158
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:29,840
that because that was left that was like

159
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:32,929
mm but they have that issue detour so in

160
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,270
pump route for we actually open for this

161
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,770
one as well it didn't github who we

162
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,610
created everything

163
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:43,098
I was it's my friend and also Dax

164
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,970
Labrador and I created a gratification

165
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,460
or rating for karma or automotive

166
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:54,530
security ball and that's what you can

167
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:57,530
see there's infotainment infotainment if

168
00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,890
you could do a people leakage basically

169
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,880
it's a p1 issue because it's all about

170
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:08,360
privacy issue and then from there the RF

171
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,800
hub if you can do keep on cloning like

172
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,710
for example the teint II and you can

173
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:18,380
clone that one so basically that's also

174
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:21,740
a p1 so they are FM radio frequency hub

175
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,110
and then if you have infotainment

176
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,380
you can do photos executions and then

177
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,529
you get people to canvas so that's

178
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:34,279
something that we reward as p2 as well

179
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:37,039
if you don't have canvas canvas fiber

180
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,499
it's just that you're able to execute

181
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,259
something locally then that's something

182
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:45,709
really rewarded copy three issues but

183
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,179
don't get me wrong okay we all know it's

184
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,008
one concert that we have remote code

185
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:51,589
execution and to manage accuracy one

186
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,019
right but it's because we're just

187
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:57,469
hacking the infotainment and for example

188
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:00,049
if DEP infotainment is on the unbox CCU

189
00:09:57,469 --> 00:10:01,939
and you can take over the car there's no

190
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:05,059
use right it's just the April Taylor's

191
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:07,608
that you were able to attack yeah so

192
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:11,569
basically if you can take over a car and

193
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:13,519
then through the infotainment you can

194
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,419
actually learn to be one because that's

195
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,759
my passion

196
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:19,159
the authentication mechanism football

197
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,789
team you're not allowed to desert so

198
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:28,189
Herman Miller and personal effects since

199
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:30,979
2018 almost all FDA's vehicles they have

200
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:34,009
are wrong they're called f30 gauges you

201
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:37,759
can't just put messages if you don't

202
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:39,769
have the right foot the right CP but if

203
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,889
you you're if you're able to crack the

204
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:45,349
EP for the heart you can actually get

205
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:47,869
further work for that as well there are

206
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:51,319
a lot of bypasses so you can't just

207
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:53,989
scoop your you can just toss some

208
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:56,779
overflow for a car if there is people

209
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:58,669
but there is a way to bypass you there

210
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:02,289
are a lot of bypasses say for example

211
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:06,769
fire hose attack can protein can quad

212
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:13,059
it's up to you how you do that acne so

213
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:16,519
the 18.1 from google so the banana guys

214
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:21,169
so literally like I said if you can

215
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:24,979
bypass the firewall for security gateway

216
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:29,899
from afar you get a p1 that's a very

217
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:34,039
critical issue okay so far well like I

218
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:38,659
said since 2018 it's not easy to hack

219
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:40,848
part okay but it can still easily that

220
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:43,849
it can still be half just not that easy

221
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:45,480
if you need to report or do some greater

222
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:47,430
than that

223
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,010
there was this one test bed for and I

224
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,979
was able to reset that UT but when I

225
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,800
tried it on a on the car itself because

226
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,680
there was no security gateway on the

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,349
Testament of the same model and my

228
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,140
attacks doesn't work that's one of the

229
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:08,070
estates that the security gateway or

230
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,230
firewall protects so if you could slash

231
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,450
our program the ACU by bypassing the

232
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:17,310
security gate near the firewall so you

233
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:23,370
are also bypassing something or you are

234
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:25,890
also well if you can be rewarded for a

235
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,470
good amount because you are not supposed

236
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,910
to do that okay but doctor they are back

237
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,260
in the base you can actually do that

238
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,630
even Campbell Indian even on all DDP so

239
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,800
you shouldn't be able to spoof that's

240
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:44,730
the pen and then there are other Android

241
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,189
or iOS app vulnerable so it's very so

242
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,190
take for example if your car has the

243
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:56,310
endpoint for an Android app it allows

244
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:01,160
you to control your car and if you find

245
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,160
in that endpoint that you are able to

246
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,119
hold it

247
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:08,459
turning off other cars so that's

248
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,380
something that really was there was an

249
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:15,000
issue before and me suddenly were in

250
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,160
people's going on to this friend he

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,649
wrote an article about it so basically

252
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,980
he has an app or Nissan Leaf lee

253
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,709
seunggi's is an electric car he just

254
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,440
tries to use Ferb and then intercept at

255
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:30,869
the request and the responses and then

256
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,560
he was able to see and an endpoint free

257
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:38,100
and it stops now so don't worry don't

258
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,040
really but basically if you know there's

259
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,709
a certain parameter which calls the VIN

260
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,510
number of the car and because the Nissan

261
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:49,439
Leaf has telematics 4G connection

262
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,670
basically if you just know the VIN

263
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,070
number of other car you can turn off

264
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,640
your car or turn on the top so that's

265
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,230
how scary it is and

266
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,750
when you save the number you could just

267
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,760
look it up right on the part do it if

268
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,570
there's a window in the car in this you

269
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,850
just eat you can see that the number so

270
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,970
it's not the VIN number that vulnerable

271
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,220
it's the ten point itself so bins are

272
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,070
public records there's been a debate it

273
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,760
should be public or private

274
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:25,420
and then web vulnerability is connected

275
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,250
to the cloud telematics firmware update

276
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,860
server so for example if your car has

277
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,740
over-the-air updates and then you

278
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,010
connect your car to Wi-Fi and then you

279
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,320
try to flip if slip on it while it's

280
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,060
updating the server and it's on HTTP for

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,040
example so maybe you can modify the

282
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,410
firmware on the block so that's

283
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,649
something that we also grew up in its

284
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,620
variants who it's probably that on that

285
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,930
endpoint there are there's a web server

286
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,290
and what if there's have skill injection

287
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,839
there's server side request forgery

288
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,120
so it's up to you just refer to all US

289
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,670
mobile top ten mythology and you know

290
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,620
hack from there so it's not just about

291
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:11,769
the hardware itself you need to look

292
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:14,230
deeper so I have some insights on common

293
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:16,029
vulnerabilities so don't mind I mean

294
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,600
that was a fight between Philippine team

295
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:22,740
or basketball in Australia oh yeah

296
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,550
it's how we got banned in people before

297
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:30,640
so one thing is that there is this

298
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,769
infotainment DOS through format string

299
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,339
vulnerability which we could classify

300
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:39,430
from my own perspective as people so in

301
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,970
background we have p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 would

302
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,339
it and if it's p5 it means it's a best

303
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,230
practice missing best practice if it's a

304
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,680
p4 it's a low vulnerability but we still

305
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,529
pay for that ok p3 p2 p1 p1 is the

306
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,349
highest so this means that if we could

307
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:58,269
create a dos out of it if you could

308
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:02,860
cause a dot for your infotainment

309
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:06,520
say this guy so a CVD 2009 2 1 2 there

310
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,620
was this guy who tested this BMW he

311
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,790
named his phone because you can name

312
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:15,050
your phone or you could also like

313
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,610
upload I mean upload an mp3 file to your

314
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,240
phone and then play it to your car

315
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,150
through Google so you could like person

316
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,700
X percent C so a lot of that you can

317
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,590
traverse and then after that after he

318
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,100
connected to his own through bluetooth

319
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,600
here brick his in patina and I'm not

320
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,000
sure what happened to him with him but

321
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,040
he told me that he actually needs to go

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,670
to the shop to have it replaced okay

323
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,069
yeah so like I said this is very risky

324
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,930
and we used to have this bug bash

325
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,300
wherein we also brick some of the

326
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,060
devices and we also have this experience

327
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:53,329
where in someone was causing a lot of

328
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,939
things on the canvas and on the end of

329
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,550
the day the car doesn't run anymore it

330
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,470
turns on but it run it doesn't run so

331
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,050
there are things like that so be careful

332
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:07,700
in this case be careful you can play

333
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,560
your favorite song anymore yeah yeah so

334
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:14,360
this is my car it's a left the two

335
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:17,450
sports basically infotainment default

336
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,909
credentials can't be an issue sometimes

337
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,400
for car manufacturers but sometimes it's

338
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,490
not okay maybe you could try to brute

339
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,890
force or maybe a accorded to other ways

340
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,350
so you need to know the default password

341
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:34,130
and they're not your attack surface or

342
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,010
you could also like you know connect

343
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,810
through SSH from that so you just need

344
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:42,710
to connect your car to your Wi-Fi router

345
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,540
and then fetch the DHCP IP address then

346
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,060
do an end map to see what are the

347
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:51,950
services then from that services try to

348
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:56,000
check if you can actually log in or you

349
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:59,060
know use snap cap so in here you can see

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,280
that the master running on FSH there's

351
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,440
an SSH service from from the

352
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,080
infotainment and the default password is

353
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,060
Jane CIA jay-z on but sometimes they

354
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,060
don't care sometimes they do okay

355
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,350
basically you can also this from the

356
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,669
same infotainment from my car

357
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,379
so if you could if you can do this then

358
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:24,320
you could also be rewarded for doing

359
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,240
command injection no canvas pilot

360
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,399
because there's no canva when you say

361
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,320
ten bucks five but it means that you

362
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:33,678
will you are able to interact with a

363
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,559
hand protocol so cars communicate with

364
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,870
their controllers and microprocessors

365
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,178
the ECU itself group the pen protocol

366
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,668
and it's not just the can protocol there

367
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:51,220
are a lot of protocols involved so I'll

368
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:53,630
show you I have the PLC forgive my

369
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:57,110
forgive me if I don't have license or

370
00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:00,019
PowerPoint because I just downloaded it

371
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:04,539
and still waiting for the IP to GE but

372
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,539
anyways it's not pirate that Bunbury

373
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:15,980
okay so um here's the chicken and me

374
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:19,309
playing a song so yeah that's a messed

375
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:23,120
up and then I just cloned the PLC that I

376
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,370
wrote for math now and it's not that

377
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,820
visible right

378
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:31,928
but anyways I'm that's my flash drive

379
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:39,820
yeah and then I entered it for my USB

380
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:42,559
your USB port on my car and then wait so

381
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,460
hit recognize my car don't mind the

382
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,750
chicken this is just chilling so

383
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:51,830
musically you just need to move forward

384
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:58,370
because it takes time but right here

385
00:19:51,830 --> 00:20:01,279
you're there you'll see that they're

386
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:08,330
useful for just an attack surface you

387
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:12,080
need to move forward and then there

388
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:15,710
after that executed the command renamed

389
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,539
space when I say as a BLT and there so

390
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:21,879
I'm the reason why master patch their

391
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,879
cars for the important is actually

392
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,729
so if you could and then you go deeper

393
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:37,510
using and react with the can you could

394
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:41,160
get rewarded higher than p3 but like I

395
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:43,890
said it's not just about combat right so

396
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,330
like I said you see your resets

397
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,580
bypassing the security gateway is up you

398
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,730
won so basically if you could reset the

399
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:55,120
ECU or the electronic control unit you

400
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,160
could you could get a very good view one

401
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,830
most likely like twenty five thousand

402
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,100
USD just for that blog or thirty

403
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:05,139
thousand Chris Vlasic and Charlie Miller

404
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,419
has a book about advanced can injection

405
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:11,130
attacks which can help and that's the

406
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:16,480
link L'Oreal shared the flight robbery

407
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:18,430
so the guys from Keene labs Fisher who

408
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,900
was sort of this guy they're one of the

409
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:25,030
Beth so basically they were able to

410
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,570
exploit the Wi-Fi stack and a Tesla

411
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:31,570
Model the infotainment o'clock basically

412
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:35,110
we from from a bug from a bug bounty

413
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,929
program perspective it's usually p3 but

414
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:41,139
I want to lean to p2 because it's a

415
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:43,420
really good research ok so there's a

416
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:47,560
reference there and they were able to

417
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:49,120
get shell by just attacking the Wi-Fi

418
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,350
stack on an invitation

419
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:59,409
oh yeah it could also be upgraded sat.1

420
00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:02,830
oh I'm getting very very uh jealous of

421
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,990
them or you know like leaning one of one

422
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,449
of the guys is actually a researcher I

423
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,950
met in Hong Kong last December

424
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,440
don't worry there was no parole the

425
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,970
virus during that time yeah oh yeah I've

426
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,060
been to Hong Kong it's very near to my

427
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:22,270
country these guys Charlie Miller and

428
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:25,270
Chris Blackwell you know and they've

429
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:28,150
really did a lot of good attacks though

430
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:32,139
when you say about our hacking they're

431
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:35,890
the reason why oh why Jeep or FCA we

432
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:40,370
have Chrysler patch resistant

433
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:47,409
then we'll have demo time from that's

434
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:49,789
right yeah so before we start our demo

435
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:51,429
these are the prerequisite so this is

436
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:58,010
what you called an instrument cluster

437
00:22:51,429 --> 00:23:01,520
okay so on right and then yeah I have

438
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:04,700
nano can for just five dollars you can

439
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,520
create your tool already I have some

440
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,080
PCBs actually still here I can give it

441
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,970
to you guys and then I have contact

442
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,389
stm32 can snipper and then I have value

443
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:20,780
can four but for this demo I'm not sure

444
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:24,549
how my stm32 doesn't work now I'm not

445
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,549
sure why but let's try later

446
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:32,270
some tools yeah there is a link and

447
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:38,059
there yeah yeah and you may not be hack

448
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:39,918
you have to hack basically you could

449
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:45,168
also start with a car hacking tools here

450
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:50,929
and you know clone the machine or you

451
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:58,520
can get use again yeah you can take

452
00:23:50,929 --> 00:24:00,320
victory great and then you can also use

453
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,970
Metasploit there are a lot of modules

454
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:11,330
for a Metasploit actually so the chicken

455
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:14,150
is here anyways I've written a module

456
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:17,570
for master - that's my favorite card so

457
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,750
I hope they don't get me to jail for

458
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:24,110
that but anyways there's a script that I

459
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:27,620
wrote which allows you to just connect

460
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:32,570
your can interface to Metasploit and

461
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:35,209
then plug them so just if you open

462
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:38,450
Metasploit just use the keyword search

463
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:42,890
automotive okay and you can see a lot of

464
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:46,070
post module once you have the hardware

465
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,020
bridge session of your campus or your

466
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:53,639
candy bars

467
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:57,179
so happy okay

468
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,910
know me do I have a I am a demo live

469
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:08,390
demo here the problem is I can't show

470
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:08,390
you the traffic behind it but anyways

471
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:16,350
it's moving right cause we can get movie

472
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,860
so I'm supposed to demo how you can like

473
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,719
you know plus it a lot but I don't know

474
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,840
what happened to my device I mean I

475
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,690
think I need to flash my device but

476
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,909
anyways take for example this is a

477
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,600
normal working of a car and you try to

478
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,730
send a lot of messages so for just you

479
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,320
know a five dollar tool you just need

480
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:42,809
Arduino Nano and MCP 2.15 to like plugs

481
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,470
come take from your car so please don't

482
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:50,760
buzz random messages your car or else

483
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:55,020
you'll you know you'll do a lot of

484
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,730
damage by the way - what module has a

485
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,160
module that allows you to test the

486
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,160
airbag but please don't try this at home

487
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:08,940
anyway so I'm not sure what happened but

488
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,580
because I'm supposed to send data

489
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:29,510
looking down but it's not working right

490
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:34,020
now but let me just try engine moving

491
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:36,150
hmm I know that's not that's a normal

492
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,889
way but it's still a but you

493
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,760
know it didn't do some other stuff but I

494
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,210
don't know what happened

495
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,890
yeah when it's okay at least me get to

496
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:52,410
know that we can actually put something

497
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:56,970
right yeah sad to say I can but here's

498
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:58,890
the actual demo of it actually IRA good

499
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,900
thing I recorded the video

500
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:05,070
so this is what you call can in the

501
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:10,559
middle so this one I'm supposed to demo

502
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:12,240
actually okay so when you do a can dump

503
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,940
this is free you just need to use the

504
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,590
can you toes and that's my tool and then

505
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm doing a man in the middle you see in

506
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:22,620
contact and that's what it did alright

507
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,580
like that so you're trying to mess up

508
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,889
hold it

509
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,600
you're not supposed you shouldn't be

510
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,510
able to do this if there's a parallel

511
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,590
okay you shouldn't be able but because I

512
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:39,679
just you know yeah use some worse

513
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:43,590
figured out the pins okay and you know

514
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,620
16 pin is actually no bolts that

515
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,250
eighteen pin is ground and 14 and 15 it

516
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,260
can high in 10 well there are a lot of

517
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,870
attacks that you can do aside from there

518
00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:01,320
and this is from my master as well this

519
00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:04,260
is the Metasploit module I created but

520
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,780
anyway it should look like this using

521
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,350
Arduino Nano and then I broke I coated

522
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:13,799
my to die node to send messages through

523
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:20,129
canva oh yeah that's from a master

524
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:25,620
I love the cluster so much from it's

525
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:27,299
really a good blaster yeah there are a

526
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,949
lot of things that you can do I mean

527
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,740
this is just a proof of concept that you

528
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,600
could do these things by snipping or

529
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,110
sending messages to a heart through

530
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,409
canvas so it's not just fix internally

531
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,049
externally there was this one researcher

532
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:45,690
where he was able to open the heart

533
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:49,590
because he opened one of the centers

534
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:51,660
okay so imagine one of the word var 30

535
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,090
doing that getting at them because it

536
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:58,110
already happened in the US when they

537
00:28:54,090 --> 00:29:02,340
tried to intercept the you know the key

538
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:08,129
fob as well anyways I'm open to

539
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:13,520
questions now so let me know if you have

540
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,520
questions you're sure

541
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:34,480
what was it again oh you mean an

542
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:36,909
injection brew dose or hi I'm sure the

543
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:49,480
IDF mike-mike for this so that I could

544
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:51,490
like you know there are some old

545
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,640
injections and illicit acts which run on

546
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,140
the UDS protocol of easier yes you have

547
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,910
to break the authentication of the UDA

548
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:05,380
so have you yeah but I kept this book

549
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:07,930
I mean I triage bugs or bugcrowd if I'm

550
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:11,110
a tree a tree hugger and I've seen those

551
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:13,810
kind of attack as well and also dead UDS

552
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:18,459
pausing as well so what kind of like

553
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:21,340
tools sometimes you can use Python can

554
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,740
and then use isotope module and then you

555
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,020
did break the C key from there I can't

556
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:30,340
show the PFC for that I'm so sorry we

557
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:32,740
have MVA but yes there we also tried

558
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:37,679
rail with it you see your resets as well

559
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:42,700
through the point injections yeah yeah

560
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:45,280
we did we did also a lot of things

561
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,650
actually but I can't

562
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,770
I'm only discussing the POC since you

563
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:53,820
know I don't want to get fired

564
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:57,010
yeah hey hi where we say where are you

565
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,860
my name is Franz nation so I don't have

566
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,129
tech company in God so we have double

567
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:05,500
telematics solutions okay so it's

568
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:09,790
completely based on IOT protocols yeah

569
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:12,850
so I mean is around protocols basically

570
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:15,639
lot of crackers and GPS trackers be who

571
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,320
works on HTTP protocol right most of the

572
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,000
Chinese trackers in India they also

573
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:25,399
Vacanti don't say that

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,550
but I ain't sorry so our protocol so we

575
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,800
use mqtt so is there any protocol

576
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,379
suggestions which you could give us

577
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,540
which we can explore or add to our

578
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,450
product you mean

579
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:42,639
how to secure it yeah I mean whatever

580
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:46,010
your sad thing is I don't know how I

581
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,230
mean I just know about offensive thanks

582
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,840
for this one but I think one thing that

583
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:53,420
you're attracted actually suggest is

584
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,980
implement a security gateway maybe

585
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,230
that's one of the things as long it

586
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,000
protects radio habitats as well a lot

587
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,160
for security cables but not to the only

588
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,220
thing that I know other from going in

589
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,210
depth I can't really share my expertise

590
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:10,640
maybe some people help you but Bosch has

591
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,580
really a good idea about that that one

592
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,830
and also Lear corporation very Mira

593
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,320
corporation here called literally do you

594
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,169
have Papa's here in here right your

595
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,810
corporation in India I think Bangalore

596
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,000
they they have good there even their

597
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:29,110
engineers are even using a security tool

598
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,060
for testing their cars they use a new

599
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:37,010
it's a very expensive new canoe canoe

600
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,230
and so basically the most common

601
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:42,700
enterprise tools for testing against

602
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:46,550
canvas hacking there's also other

603
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:53,240
protocols you have canoe and vehicle

604
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:57,740
spine yeah vehicles pie and pendant sure

605
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,240
hi hello in one question so as we talk

606
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,560
about the issue like you can't control

607
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:06,350
you so if I'm able to in the solution is

608
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,510
an idea so if you how much security do

609
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,429
you think the it'll be at least 80 or

610
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,040
690 person production for the cars are

611
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,080
like very how much is the yeah

612
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,740
is it a good solution to have ideas

613
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:22,250
ideas on issue or is it fine so

614
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,960
basically there's ideas I've heard from

615
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,570
one of my friends the founder of car

616
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:31,460
hacking village there's already an IDs

617
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:33,040
and that's not yet you know big in the

618
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,990
market right now

619
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,960
if you could do that I'm pretty sure

620
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,100
you're gonna get rich few years back I

621
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,730
was working it boys

622
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,169
so they had more yeah it was working and

623
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,320
implementing this ideas I pissed and I

624
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:49,810
am I'm now Honeywell so not sure so

625
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,760
basically for boss they're the ones

626
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,280
designing most security gateway Freddie

627
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,140
okay okay so they have what they call

628
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,950
security gateway but we don't call them

629
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:03,340
call them as IDs it's basically a part

630
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:07,360
one but I heard that there's really an

631
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:09,850
idea for a hard but not yet like

632
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,500
launched your market correctly none of

633
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:15,130
the cars and even to that particular

634
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,870
solution none of the US manufacturers

635
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:21,700
have implemented those solution IDs and

636
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:23,529
ApS one is already I'm not sure but

637
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,649
someone said that he was able to test

638
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:29,710
one okay but you know it's not yet that

639
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:32,860
car didn't like Ranelagh in the street

640
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:35,860
yet yeah I'm not sure who actually but

641
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:38,050
as far as I know Bosh is developing I

642
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,690
have actually one of their buses from

643
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:45,280
boss and love boss but I wasn't able to

644
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:48,730
like you know played a lot on their

645
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,250
firewall I mean just physically Hardware

646
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:55,210
everything though but I was able to see

647
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:57,550
how it was okay by that yeah thank you

648
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:02,830
and then also how it can pretend give

649
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:10,810
them a debt Honeywell you work at Palo

650
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:15,700
Alto High I mean I have some idea what

651
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:17,529
if I had one question okay when we talk

652
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,240
about automated security and quads I

653
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,870
either take the positive energy

654
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:26,020
available like all those stuff or the

655
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:28,240
top pulley odd can nobody talks with any

656
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,240
other protocols like some IP moves or

657
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,770
anything is it that if there is no

658
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,339
research going on in Ghost Protocol

659
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:38,200
sorry baby can you just be available so

660
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,350
there's also research going on perplex

661
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,029
ray soap like pray you could actually do

662
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,549
a man-in-the-middle prop like pray as

663
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,050
well there's a new write up today

664
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,410
I'm sorry I haven't

665
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,810
added it for my slide I'm supposed to if

666
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,730
you haven't liked a reminded me I'm

667
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,130
supposed to add that one but you know

668
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,350
someone was able to do a can in the

669
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,150
middle group luxray and control the

670
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,730
steering wheel okay

671
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,950
imagine control in the steering wheel so

672
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,619
this is not a temporal but yeah luckily

673
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,589
III understand that I mean the critical

674
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:13,810
systems are on flex rate is high

675
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,820
bandwidth system that's why we are only

676
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:18,250
focusing on can like all the issues that

677
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,810
you said mostly they were either in

678
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,210
Bluetooth Wi-Fi or in 10

679
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,549
I have not seen any public disclosure

680
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,100
issues that are in Flex really moves

681
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,350
automatically there is already a public

682
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:36,310
disclosure for odd me about black thread

683
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:38,230
okay so basically uh all I can really

684
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,660
tell you about good things that there's

685
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,869
a lot of things going on from the car

686
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,609
hacking village ENCOM yeah it's not just

687
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:48,880
about can but you know it's easier for

688
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,700
us to give a demo as a POC on me yeah

689
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,890
but there are a lot of things going on

690
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:58,270
for our buck Baptist reverse engineering

691
00:36:53,890 --> 00:37:03,629
as well and then IOT or telematics and

692
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:06,070
then other protocols black gray and then

693
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,230
there are a lot actually even they opt

694
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,680
to their hit up certain pin out for it

695
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,910
yeah but you know can but it's like

696
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,440
easiest thing that you could do even

697
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:21,190
claims have canva even even satellites

698
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,590
up Kendall but because we'll corona

699
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:26,470
actually confirm that to me that he was

700
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:28,750
able to see the Pierce Campbell so if

701
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:33,069
you know will corona he's like the nut

702
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:37,980
Corona her wrong now he was the one who

703
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,980
talked about freaking elevators and gone

704
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,040
I understand that these are protocols

705
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:46,750
and at some point protocol level issues

706
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,930
will be three spider platforms like

707
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,520
autos are all continue attack him so we

708
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,379
actually look into application

709
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,739
individuals which are beyond the

710
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,299
diffusion of

711
00:37:54,739 --> 00:38:00,859
luckily key management issues I mean is

712
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:03,769
there any research going on in dietary

713
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:07,098
laws alpha water figured it will be hurt

714
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:09,979
you know and they talked about the

715
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:11,989
security at I promote Elton yeah because

716
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:15,379
I mean anything goes

717
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:17,180
they target them in keeping implement

718
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,190
appropriate risk of it it will disclose

719
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,739
what facutly

720
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,749
what daytime the can was mean what it is

721
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:25,670
you have to figure it out yourself

722
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:27,558
yeah is there any standardization or

723
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:31,249
something like OPDs defined some of the

724
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:33,049
services but still not Musab then there

725
00:38:31,249 --> 00:38:35,509
has to be some way for the substitute

726
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:40,430
really explore how to understand the

727
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:42,650
data that is fully okay yeah automotive

728
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:45,078
curative liquid they do like that they

729
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,029
have a lot of title without that there

730
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,779
is no automotive security research group

731
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:53,749
in India but there's one and London in

732
00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:57,499
the US and Detroit and then there's one

733
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:59,359
in Singapore so they must per Singapore

734
00:38:57,499 --> 00:39:01,519
they didn't talk about that usually it's

735
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,440
all about creating their own car in a

736
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,078
box I also have my car in the box at

737
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,479
home so that's usually the focus of

738
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,479
automotive security research group in

739
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:14,390
Singapore but if you want to dive into

740
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:16,910
that more research about that in Detroit

741
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,219
they really do those penances I mean

742
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,440
I've listened to some top and telling

743
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:27,019
the truth I don't even understand some

744
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,219
of the pages there's a very welcome I'm

745
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:30,799
not sure if I answered your question

746
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:32,839
correctly but you know

747
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:36,529
so basically automotive security is not

748
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:38,900
my forte I mean like my expertise really

749
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:39,499
so I just have experience with our bug

750
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,749
that's it

751
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:43,339
so that's the reason why I have like you

752
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:45,948
know some day and from POC

753
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:53,180
but I've seen some attacks of I get this

754
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:56,070
done for nd April but security can't

755
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:00,000
really helps with that yeah

756
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:01,950
yeah no more questions thank you for

757
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,220
your time and I hope you learned

758
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,220
something

759
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,510
[Applause]
