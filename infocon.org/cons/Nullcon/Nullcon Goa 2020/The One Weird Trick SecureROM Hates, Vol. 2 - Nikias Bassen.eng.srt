1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,550
hey this is Cooper we had a lot of

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,309
static coming from the mixer desk when I

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,099
recorded this talk as a result I had to

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,779
cut the first two minutes of audio and

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:23,759
for the first 40 minutes the removal of

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:27,779
most well a lot of the static resulted

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,779
in the sound being rather distorted we

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,750
do apologize for this it's a shame we

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,290
didn't catch the tuner I do believe that

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,809
what remains is still audible enough to

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,460
at least be workable but yeah I am

12
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,459
deeply apologize for this

13
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:06,440
and the checkering he has been the

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:11,080
parenting has been treating the poor

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:14,180
parties and approve very large and to

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,280
start from the actual export itself and

17
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:27,709
make a college favorite out of it so

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:29,570
this is gorgeous anti petrified and not

19
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,510
going to name all the people via

20
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:37,570
congested slightly harm others like who

21
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:43,399
are not to MI and the trickery team is a

22
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:46,940
group of many people from around I left

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:53,239
acting and racing both Cochran and

24
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:55,730
hardware and actually you might say if

25
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,730
you have G or people that you could

26
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:06,859
imagine the water even single people

27
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:11,959
experience and different view so this is

28
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:15,049
something that also in my case is really

29
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,380
a pleasure to be part of it and what

30
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:23,209
were these people because they theory

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,859
and opportunity that you can just change

32
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,320
all the ideas and work on something

33
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:32,799
really cute that affect millions of

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:39,048
people so let's get right into it

35
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:43,670
firstly retract what if you're on is the

36
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:47,920
various code the run on dedicated

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:51,170
processor when we start a modern device

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:57,380
it's basically a stripped-down version

39
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:59,720
of the iBook part of the silicon so it's

40
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,640
not like a proper cognitive in the face

41
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,030
but it's like burnt into the actual

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:09,019
silicon and if you'd only other in and

43
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,750
we cannot just override it and the

44
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,600
access to it is already hard enough the

45
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,890
only way to do it is like finding an

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:24,290
exploit to the ultimately and try to

47
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:27,050
circumvent is protecting this is also

48
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,150
considered the most trusted code that

49
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,560
runs on the application hospital because

50
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:38,270
it is like the lowest point of the

51
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,910
attraction because all other steps that

52
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:45,109
always basically rely on the integrity

53
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:51,220
of this component and the main role of

54
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:59,930
the pyramid that is proposed to load a

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:03,770
bootloader that is that is validated so

56
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:07,370
that it does not run any food order but

57
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:12,169
like the very 81 one it is only one echo

58
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:15,560
indicate and it also has features that

59
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:20,540
allow you have read of the device and

60
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,270
page like the 515 retroactive or also

61
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,570
possible use that will perform a

62
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,870
software update

63
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:33,620
by uploading English abilities usually

64
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:36,980
cover up is multiple animals that depend

65
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,550
upon the human target everything said in

66
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:44,900
a coordinated are to update and you have

67
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:47,030
the community usually you enter the diva

68
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,590
mode by pressing a specific key

69
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:59,000
combination after device when it rehab

70
00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:02,619
and then can perform to be to move we

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,700
can't make the basically secure boot and

72
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:12,140
apple or a web if you want to premiere

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,659
this concept of the shoe boot as I

74
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,270
mentioned a key part of the tractor two

75
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,060
different because the first change that

76
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:34,840
just come to be

77
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:38,740
trouble and not if the component that is

78
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:54,969
supposed to be in the integrity should

79
00:06:38,740 --> 00:07:01,060
not be when when you want to start a

80
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:04,630
business from Fiji mode the device is

81
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:09,340
validated in a region and it applies to

82
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:12,280
on this images like columns a device

83
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,340
that already like that already had to

84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,210
offer on it but also it applies to in my

85
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:24,429
images except for your account for the

86
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:28,659
one that a non-volatile storage also

87
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:31,120
affected by the in edit effect and that

88
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,120
way you could say that if you do

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,669
mechanism this basically number one

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:42,640
enemy for everything and because

91
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:47,320
everything relies on bypassing security

92
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,750
checks and either by compromising one of

93
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,880
the node in the chain of crap

94
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:56,139
till they offer be the first element

95
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,570
which is or by compromising the system

96
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,900
that already qualitative term by other

97
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,900
means

98
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:09,840
so I remain can give you a fusion

99
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:14,830
general type kind of course they're

100
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:22,299
allowed to transfer it out the duration

101
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:25,780
for control messages and the basic order

102
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:31,810
that we have like a big amount of coated

103
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,780
need to run to allow a port of relative

104
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,789
unit

105
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:40,098
and the data type that in turn for our

106
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:44,420
upload it is written request to direct

107
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:48,460
in one one and when the country towns

108
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:53,329
and villages sequence of follow-up

109
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:56,600
tickets and a recap that we ran then how

110
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:00,580
the figure until day to equity issue

111
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:05,690
mode and start to use immediately enter

112
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:10,870
but we can also exit this limo with a

113
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:13,940
specific easy abort method we 21 for

114
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,760
because it will be that sometimes you

115
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,700
actually have to control when we want to

116
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:25,280
actually limit so UT control center of

117
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,040
the package that I did to can date it

118
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:36,530
from the hope to device or request a

119
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:39,939
jazz combo device if you like if you

120
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:43,160
make it you might look up then

121
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,370
latin-american attending a package back

122
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,800
and forth and the first package it had

123
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:54,890
updated very simple structure and has a

124
00:09:48,800 --> 00:10:01,520
very certified and it just contains

125
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:08,210
locality the next packet is to be like a

126
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:11,060
data transfer if the length of the

127
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,940
packet this mantener then it means that

128
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:19,790
protected will be the negative of the

129
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:21,589
data packet right database for example a

130
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,510
beauty mode that how the data transfer

131
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:29,210
to come how to divide it could openly

132
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:33,830
other way one but it's basically hand on

133
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:39,170
the title that the first preferred an

134
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:42,709
attacker the diggity diggity

135
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:46,760
allowed to send data in hand usually

136
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:50,640
have 235

137
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,760
and me in the front lamp would be a

138
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,480
disciplined number in the range between

139
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,860
eight and in critical bite and the

140
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,170
attendant different and when the

141
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,170
transfer from then it would hand a hero

142
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:14,219
left attitude tell the other type I get

143
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:15,569
is relaxed and of a doctor in the I

144
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,430
would be assessed

145
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:25,080
there's a temporary buffer that is

146
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:27,989
allocated when used in afterlife and the

147
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,560
data package the content of the day of a

148
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:35,400
trip ticket man copy to this repeated

149
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:41,459
proper a penis they happen disease it's

150
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:45,209
very important here he said it dripped

151
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:49,950
on a penitent original and the triggered

152
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:54,390
a location of this refer to a hotel

153
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:58,650
temporary data for the for the decade

154
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:00,900
so once the transfer is issued the point

155
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,840
is it rather will be hawkish a global

156
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:07,199
variable the effect will then use a

157
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:11,090
definition or the day has come in the

158
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,670
following packet for available but

159
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:19,970
accident continue the proactive turn of

160
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:25,290
the defect so to autofill the buffer

161
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:31,380
they were dedicated friend run it and

162
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:35,189
easy mode it stores the pointer to the

163
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:37,380
buffer in a global variable on to

164
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:42,990
trigger to three of this set rapper when

165
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:45,930
the activity mode and it's never allowed

166
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,730
out of the variable will still contain

167
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:53,939
the address of the previous a location

168
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:57,650
and is requested you have between type

169
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,650
of 120

170
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:09,689
to trigger it you basically have to

171
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:11,820
start a control transfer and with the

172
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,610
data pages that you have to read by the

173
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,290
pipe and then you have to interrupt the

174
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:23,340
transfer like during like when it's

175
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:27,569
still pending data just the board he the

176
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:30,360
transfer using a video board we work

177
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,550
hard to create a temporary buffer and

178
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,590
then it will reenter the Izumo because

179
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,560
whatever you send is not a valid image

180
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:40,680
which is this tail and then it will

181
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,880
 eg mode and then it will rotate

182
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,979
stock buffer and it tries to complete to

183
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,920
create the interrupted transfer actually

184
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:56,400
when it ends if you mode and again it

185
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:03,449
will run copy the data that you send on

186
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:06,449
top of the 3.8 so how does the practical

187
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:10,020
figure of life because this is all the

188
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:13,110
theory like you know cancel the transfer

189
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:16,560
and then hope that it come over all that

190
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,390
it's not a research something we cannot

191
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,329
really dragged by the way it's not

192
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,650
difficult enough you are you don't see

193
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:28,890
what happened

194
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:32,610
divided into eight like an environment

195
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:35,520
page and delete after and you had little

196
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:41,730
arrow and khadijah using an Arduino

197
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:43,980
board with mooji hope at all logic at

198
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:49,320
pro controller on the vp

199
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:55,490
hope track and this is what you need if

200
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,490
you want to be able to have a transfer

201
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,340
because what you effects they don't

202
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:07,439
really go together unless you you know

203
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:11,340
do some little trip rectory the one on

204
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:17,630
network ATP has an api that allows

205
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:26,190
body transferred his right elbow left

206
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:29,070
author word atomic was physically abused

207
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:33,030
the stacked a method to have it aborted

208
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,360
happier it's not deterministic quite

209
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:39,329
like this like in a flight time

210
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:45,170
different if you tried it but you can

211
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:51,900
fight multiple times which is helpful

212
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:54,780
and however what most of us defect the

213
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,090
if I always beautiful Network one you

214
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:02,699
here at that uniform in there when we

215
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:05,250
agreed they have a way to tell how much

216
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,710
data was transferred press that up

217
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,840
important it is a complete wreck about

218
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:13,400
actual amount of data that was

219
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:17,310
constantly you know you can basically

220
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:21,900
profile will result in theory object to

221
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:26,729
this point in time for avoiding the

222
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:31,410
transfer they're basically a practically

223
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:33,690
deterministic implementation because it

224
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,689
will not become Netflix the link below

225
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,850
to that way to get it somehow reliable

226
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,420
or like the most reliable at the finger

227
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:45,120
I mean without you know captain hardware

228
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,120
because if you have a quality

229
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,120
harbour control then you can call these

230
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,070
kinds of very direct and separately

231
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,960
possible but it requires lot of work

232
00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:01,380
obviously this is what did how the

233
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:08,090
detected of the flight from Suzanne

234
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:12,990
little logo they call it off yeah but

235
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:16,770
the accurate here for at 20:50 wrong so

236
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:20,599
now that you know how we can take it one

237
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,599
Verity and make it

238
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:30,850
you want to be now how how can actually

239
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:37,060
make you so interesting we promote

240
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:42,010
devices nothing will happen because the

241
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:48,370
ways the code is divine however for a

242
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:51,900
eight and a nine older devices they have

243
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,459
a back-end egg to give you handle hope

244
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:58,660
before technology will faithfully

245
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:04,120
without structure whatever you may

246
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:09,120
believe you board and that's what is

247
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:14,770
ended lab analyzed and ability the first

248
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:20,139
few effort is that to the film Aquatica

249
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:23,590
this method so how does it work

250
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:29,770
to tend to wrap the half half tractor

251
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:33,220
and the different perform to help you if

252
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,570
you take the register into the project

253
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,570
and with pleasure

254
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:45,520
the benefit of different beliefs call

255
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,040
the register from the structure and used

256
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,870
up the feed it happened on the country

257
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:55,620
editor so you can you cannot override

258
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:59,159
the register because then it will

259
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:06,250
overwrite and again

260
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:09,840
however the tap it happily and allows

261
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,850
you to figure out which is the next time

262
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,560
you connect active to be chosen for

263
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:21,520
children and that allowed negative

264
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:25,090
credit edge have the structure to can

265
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:31,240
control for the dishes like the register

266
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:34,090
page so when it executed it will record

267
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,260
the register

268
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:42,610
educate you ready hey and this is we

269
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:49,059
don't eat raw or drop disease and mr.

270
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:51,250
Cory education in just habit on to the

271
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:59,830
purple that you want educating is

272
00:19:51,250 --> 00:20:06,190
running for 30 to the 1 F 1 which is a

273
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:10,658
page of what also a 7 8 10 avec 11 hims

274
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:13,470
they cannot be used ready because these

275
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:18,190
devices they don't have this right and

276
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:21,159
wrong vehicle and there is no

277
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:25,330
contractors that you can lead to avoid

278
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:32,380
it and it also does not trigger any

279
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:35,199
crack in Guam so determinately

280
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,630
in after that the proper if we located

281
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,559
at with the direct hang straight every

282
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:44,350
time when we take it away right so what

283
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:47,320
we need is a way to operate with

284
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:51,600
determinism you can get a copy that that

285
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:56,100
we otherwise would just overwrite within

286
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,100
the same region of memory at the time

287
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:07,330
not allowed give that so the elevator

288
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:11,770
and if you're on it will give you this

289
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:15,449
model hole in the aroma or the

290
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:20,110
allocation height that you have and

291
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:25,690
these allow if you to be country the

292
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:28,928
very layout for the popular and this is

293
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:37,409
what economies to age with attractive

294
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:46,630
conditions and portly to support up

295
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:47,710
control a location for parity they will

296
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,940
be transferred

297
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:55,180
they have structure there is a local

298
00:21:51,940 --> 00:22:00,150
entity and you can also have multiple

299
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:08,140
transfers happening at the same time and

300
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:11,560
like you can edit a tent multiple it wet

301
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,660
and then called in endpoint the device

302
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,570
is waiting for more data but you don't

303
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,860
end it and it was still even in the name

304
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:28,139
for a while before the Polina and this

305
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:35,469
is how a bility fill up this memory for

306
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:39,100
this amount of time and that's what we

307
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,830
can make it up and totally fillet

308
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:45,129
basically under the pier the condition

309
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:55,480
of this hospital and where the disease

310
00:22:45,130 --> 00:23:01,680
is cut down but allowed to have a layer

311
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:05,860
for each column is read for allocation

312
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:16,300
detected in cable TV to abort a part of

313
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:19,030
their occur is exactly what we wanted to

314
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:26,320
influence the next location for the

315
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:30,490
buffer but want to go there and share

316
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:35,320
the back and you detect dignity and

317
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:38,680
abuse to anything have a location that

318
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,590
we first fought with is a continent

319
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,770
agent so negative amount to a fertility

320
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:50,250
rate and then the energy again it is is

321
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:50,250
--it and a pure protein of knowing

322
00:23:50,280 --> 00:24:01,100
you're elevated and the standard record

323
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:05,029
is what we practice tractor and the

324
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:07,759
granted when this request a copy or when

325
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:09,799
we set up down accomplish that when

326
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,000
distracted heading down giving you an

327
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:17,440
actor is never handle and up the movie

328
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,539
and you pretended air conditioning as

329
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,880
only package that not be in condition or

330
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:26,029
the Trivedi is constant it is not a

331
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:32,269
multiple of fifty four five and then it

332
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:36,740
will not physically any interactive I

333
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:41,480
believe me because that targeting regime

334
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:46,100
is that if you lack it has the exact

335
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,679
height of the package and then you have

336
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,990
to company van packet otherwise we do

337
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:57,490
not effectively don't happen in fy12

338
00:24:50,990 --> 00:25:02,149
daily so you can use the lead on these

339
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:05,509
careful practically okay and then it

340
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:10,639
have basically a hole in the narrow area

341
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:17,740
that has a satisfied that will be used

342
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:32,600
for a captive intelligent and also

343
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:36,019
obviously attracted the patent code data

344
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:40,459
structure and the tracker contains some

345
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:45,529
quantity go back and tell you now and

346
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:48,860
ADA 58 a tractor with the function

347
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:53,769
pointers only filled the cap over one

348
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:58,820
execute and perform is a poppy so the

349
00:25:53,769 --> 00:26:00,159
very end of human interest Ram wherever

350
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:08,418
you go

351
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:12,769
clear different work or activity and

352
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:15,669
this is the dislike depravity fantastic

353
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,669
reviews and

354
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:28,720
or devices have the problem because it

355
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:30,400
is not always bigger or anti-treaty

356
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,980
regret

357
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:39,010
but there's another community by hitting

358
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:44,520
up the heat just take longer can you

359
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:48,550
hold it up if you have it kill the heat

360
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,950
until it reaches a point where it the

361
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,240
remaining free knowing has affected the

362
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:58,900
ties that you want to have for the

363
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:05,320
cottage and education for our target

364
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:09,250
location and fitness facility how to

365
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,429
gain qualifications and but this is the

366
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:17,670
codec you want to be market leader kind

367
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:23,980
of bouquet to really have company book

368
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:27,910
so it's 20 lira got high we have for

369
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:32,880
execution the door to duty device Molly

370
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:39,010
but compromise the book the bootloader

371
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:48,700
so data to end up being able to have the

372
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:53,890
contact and yeah we can happily rekted

373
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:56,350
able to perfection and this is quite

374
00:27:53,890 --> 00:28:00,600
tricky because if you want to support

375
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:03,419
multiple devices and multiple versions

376
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,949
you don't want to manage like all these

377
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:14,500
objects all the different devices and

378
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:19,740
written so probably the next hundred is

379
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,740
permanently find the location to type

380
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,770
and because otherwise it would be

381
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,070
maintainable is ejecting of 1 hour

382
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,110
version there

383
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,560
my device energy that you would have to

384
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,719
cover that it really came and then you

385
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,720
have multiple versions it makes it even

386
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,790
worse and then you have blue version if

387
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,240
you still wanted to court without you

388
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:52,580
know dragon contract and marwah it again

389
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:56,420
so yeah tech finder so I would make use

390
00:28:52,580 --> 00:29:00,830
of a good travel which is a little

391
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:06,820
deputy da track the AMA twist at one and

392
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:09,679
it will wipe the previous didn't is it

393
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,919
teacher on then obviously not liking it

394
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,860
but it is a big actor it out of each

395
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,620
arrow and new and it's quite all

396
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,689
registers including one which is

397
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:26,449
literally magnet and whack so this is

398
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:30,740
very easy to find if you just search for

399
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:34,400
the move a rerun traction because

400
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:39,160
usually it's not threatening and the

401
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:42,130
other hope and we can really right

402
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,070
contractor that it's allocating there

403
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:48,260
but there it became an egg problem

404
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:53,450
because it will wipe the trenches with

405
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:55,670
water so it happy relocated from the

406
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:00,770
bootloader and the phenomena is not led

407
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:06,350
by I did the other wizard indirectly

408
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:11,210
product but on converting company 834

409
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:13,459
twenty degrees of felicity is

410
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:17,150
problematic because quality pure on

411
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,550
excuse only and in high productivity

412
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:24,500
because it happened and in that case it

413
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:32,290
would be quite a good order and that you

414
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:35,270
cannot maybe that this but we can

415
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:41,290
relocate it if you run into harem the

416
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:47,740
term and author appt r0p Oh

417
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:51,139
interacting or in that moment on devices

418
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,540
you can use the atomic clock kilowatt

419
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,660
array for this we can put the whole

420
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:01,450
domino but on other devices it doesn't

421
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:05,600
have a actually in a district

422
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:11,540
so this case you could use on Encarta

423
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:14,929
strategies that we tied to eat we will

424
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:19,010
talk more as it has as addressable a

425
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:22,670
tram but only if you have one single

426
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:29,570
page or as already sampling news like

427
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:33,500
the coordinate yeah not only time ever

428
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:38,169
that we actually wanted that circle but

429
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:41,360
yet critical elaborately a and

430
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:45,430
yeah also poverty want to be a mama do

431
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:49,240
it heartily desire on so we can use yeah

432
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:52,160
because I want if you my name is

433
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,280
determinate life so the destructor

434
00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:02,680
bootloader is actually part of from the

435
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:07,220
geminal today in infinite tradition and

436
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:10,520
the Rattler buddha i have periodic table

437
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:14,090
view the daily Finnerty north that has

438
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:20,900
even available a department and it to

439
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:24,530
Apple a lot and this is what we came at

440
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:28,570
you to have an outer amount of data

441
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:36,050
format alkylation hatred love it kidnap

442
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:39,919
without having to neutralize order that

443
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:44,570
portent of um can be paper I will crack

444
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:48,410
and with very background tried to copy

445
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,770
the euro and we detect that drain edit

446
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,960
the code we write out overlap with the

447
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,109
circle

448
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,839
they make it enough that is nothing

449
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:05,080
anything the country might spread it

450
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:08,399
works pretty well so so want to

451
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,989
carefully hope and the g0 hope on trade

452
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:15,369
you can reach the next traveling

453
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:21,429
invocation 8380 filled the hope

454
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:28,359
connected the rotor required for /

455
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:32,200
portable fan pages 8 and later the only

456
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:38,049
way is one so this must not be required

457
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:41,229
anymore so eventually the Buddha will

458
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,089
have the trainer prepare and the company

459
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:46,929
would be easier to invoke the empty

460
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:52,229
point to the kernel on provided where

461
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:56,259
he'll be present we have a monitor with

462
00:33:52,229 --> 00:34:03,269
one and the argument and and he point

463
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:07,179
attacked and loaded dear one politically

464
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:12,730
the book that is performed on the

465
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:16,779
trampoline to me that overwrite a branch

466
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:19,059
target into the purple team that

467
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:20,319
uploaded and then we have the original

468
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:26,730
value in the register

469
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:26,730
that is present on the interior and then

470
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,539
get it to AP and you can now take the

471
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:38,379
comment that we have careful if I make

472
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:41,319
it country and we run the careful the

473
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:45,129
prominent if you want to support many

474
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:47,949
devotees and version without you know

475
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:54,730
maintain their code for everything to

476
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:59,950
divide textual Cassandra the problem is

477
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:03,250
the way and we'll have the trampoline -

478
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,390
Jennifer get it isn't the earth no mmm

479
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,700
you are taking a neighbor and

480
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:12,259
think about that the economy is really

481
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:17,330
large and it will be 50 flow for a

482
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:22,090
viable effect because coming memory

483
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:23,480
activity and a heartless alter image and

484
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,180
long

485
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,640
so what you were in turned back on and

486
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:40,609
you instead of TV impressions that we

487
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:46,270
met a view of um capital so then leave

488
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:46,270
that for the Pathfinder to work on that

489
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:52,670
other than that basically justify it to

490
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,560
the alternate access because at this

491
00:35:52,670 --> 00:36:01,970
point in time there's no contact

492
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:05,180
protection there's no API only agent not

493
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:08,720
initialized yet so if David Lee it's

494
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,540
back to Iowa evident to all these new

495
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,120
litigation we're not present when we

496
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:18,529
have to do a tactical EMF protect

497
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:22,460
important heard in AML capitalism can

498
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:32,120
book my favorite hook mount faculty be

499
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:35,810
zero ATF partisan but it purchased the

500
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:40,299
car initially had the first remedy when

501
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:43,009
decision booth if you remote you want to

502
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:47,780
repair if I hold a broken page is

503
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:51,560
mortgage and go to do that basically and

504
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,610
edit and render into the circle then we

505
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,850
hide it

506
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:59,420
the j0 the Euro moto education and then

507
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:04,610
we had to divide P antic on a good

508
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:07,370
argument program method and then it will

509
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:10,180
is that a beautiful identity part of

510
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,180
this

511
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:18,580
well that happen sometimes that habit 20

512
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,580
or more hundred

513
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:29,990
No yeah so instead of happy it would

514
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:33,290
like the regular elite irregular

515
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:42,560
rectified today we have it use this more

516
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:45,410
understated attack and that picture type

517
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:53,660
of little later that you know it put

518
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:58,279
something up people okay so we started

519
00:37:53,660 --> 00:38:00,770
from if you're on tour education got all

520
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,790
the way if you give them out for

521
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,550
execution

522
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:07,400
but the render really small because

523
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:11,570
otherwise would address you want to

524
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:14,390
transfer to review your you know meant

525
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:17,570
to be exactly Frankfurt the next lower

526
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:22,730
or not like that 50 megabyte another

527
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:27,110
content and it's just not a good you

528
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:30,500
have to wait that long so we needed a

529
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:34,990
better vision for that and it cut the

530
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:38,600
credit also the auto populate contract

531
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:41,089
if you ate four titles though put it in

532
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:46,210
a blender and then ship that in right it

533
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:50,530
wll be you can also put control a track

534
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:56,690
with you obviously want to prevent you

535
00:38:50,530 --> 00:39:00,730
and automatic because if you don't you

536
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:03,700
can't use the kind of environment then

537
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:08,000
how would you know track your own

538
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:13,700
program on the windows so you can any

539
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:17,360
future and also come level and to emit

540
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:20,029
again you can happen with the program so

541
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,040
what you get is equal to 80 power over

542
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,280
the trickiness

543
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,279
Canadian term

544
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,199
[Music]

545
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,139
[Music]

546
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:07,960
and until properly neutralized you will

547
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:10,180
not have so what you have to do that we

548
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:16,180
need to continue the normal group of

549
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:18,580
people so it's part one so hopefully we

550
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:21,609
will get access to the user data

551
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:25,470
partition so we need to do it some

552
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:27,580
somewhere early but also not too late we

553
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,980
only need to make sure that data

554
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,590
protection has been enabled like access

555
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:36,040
has been enabled so what we do is we

556
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:39,970
keep on using the Union mounting trick

557
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:44,040
to in this case use another this image

558
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:47,500
that is mounted on top of user lip exact

559
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,370
basically allowing us to yeah replace

560
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:55,780
any system demon that is currently there

561
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:59,230
with our own version and we figured that

562
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:02,950
the sister this check demon that runs at

563
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:08,770
some points on the device boots seems to

564
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:11,589
be very good timing across different

565
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:14,530
versions because it also differs how the

566
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:18,040
system behaves but this one was like the

567
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:21,790
best choice and then we exactly our way

568
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,950
back into AV node from the origin Ram

569
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:26,380
disk remember the really tiny one and

570
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,930
then we forcefully unmount the

571
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:35,440
user lib exact image because we want to

572
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:38,919
have original user live exact back so

573
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,210
that we have the the system like the

574
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:45,130
integrity of the system is still kind of

575
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:49,180
original I mean we already broke the

576
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:52,870
integrity but yeah we don't want to

577
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:55,810
break too much so now we can have launch

578
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:59,410
D continue booting just by basically

579
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:02,920
it's probably exactly e on it then we

580
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:05,890
can fork off before we do that so we

581
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:09,520
have our own code that has executed when

582
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:11,890
the system boots and we do that to

583
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,790
basically allow to transfer another

584
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:19,270
image in this case it's using use Emacs

585
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:23,080
which is the communication protocol

586
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:26,590
through the USB connection that is also

587
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:30,810
used by iTunes and other tools like

588
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:34,000
Xcode and that uses like full speed USB

589
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:37,779
so we can basically upload whatever we

590
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,890
want at this point and usually what we

591
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:44,920
need for an initial setup is what we

592
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:48,430
want to have an SSH daemon so we can log

593
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,440
in to the device and but we also want to

594
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:55,330
have something for the user so we

595
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:59,110
install an check-rein app which in turn

596
00:43:55,330 --> 00:44:01,500
will allow the user to bootstrap the

597
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:05,140
device by preparing the root filesystem

598
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:09,340
installing a package manager and to do

599
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,580
that we basically mount on top of slash

600
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,320
bin pack which is the location that we

601
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:18,460
chose for it and then we kickstart if

602
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:25,810
it's H demon so we can log in yeah

603
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:29,830
sample image and then one spring what

604
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:33,130
runs like the device continues booting

605
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:35,549
and some point through what is running

606
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:37,609
then we will also have the check-rein up

607
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:43,529
[Music]

608
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:53,390
okay so this is the basic workflow of

609
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:57,539
the the jailbreak sequence and when we

610
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:00,538
edit this this Arabic tool we started

611
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:05,009
for with a Mac OS version because first

612
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:07,319
thing is we had background research from

613
00:45:05,009 --> 00:45:11,220
EXO mix that demonstrated that you can

614
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:18,630
use easily use the IOUs East Act on

615
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:20,819
network to pull off this attack but on

616
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:24,950
other platform it was more complex and

617
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:27,210
that's why it couldn't just release like

618
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:29,629
mcquoddy not Windows version at the same

619
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:33,269
time because it's really a lot of work

620
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:37,019
so when it a real question well it's

621
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:38,609
already released the thing is why did it

622
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:43,669
take so long many people didn't

623
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:46,558
understand the reason for it and if you

624
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:50,069
if you want if you rewind a little bit

625
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:52,769
in this presentation then I already said

626
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:57,239
that it's very critical that for the

627
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:59,848
exploit to be usable you need to be able

628
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:04,609
to have partial control transfers you

629
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:07,109
can abort the specific point in time and

630
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:10,440
the thing is that every platform is

631
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:13,170
handling this differently and you really

632
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,309
required some research and some tricks

633
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:19,440
to get it to work on peanuts and in a

634
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:22,440
somewhat reliable way and it's worse

635
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,920
than on network and it also depends on

636
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:29,219
the hardware for example the raspberry

637
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,089
pi 3 or restaurant I hear oh they use

638
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:35,910
click on folder is the way it's it's

639
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:38,609
exposed to the the running system will

640
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:42,269
not allow it to perform the host ID

641
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:43,890
attack it's not it's not that it's not

642
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:47,218
possible at all but it would basically

643
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:50,740
require to directly talk to the actual

644
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:54,140
UT stack and it's just

645
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:58,189
it is just not something that you really

646
00:46:54,140 --> 00:47:01,730
want to waste time on so basically you

647
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:03,769
have to go for a different hardware in

648
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,930
this case there are clear pipe or by the

649
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:08,990
way it works so because it have

650
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:13,730
dedicated UV controller but the previous

651
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:16,249
generations have the OTG USB controller

652
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:19,190
that is embedded into the atmosphere so

653
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:21,558
that's by the way it's perfectly the

654
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:25,160
same one that's also inside of the

655
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:29,869
iPhone which is kind of funny but it's

656
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:32,359
the other end so yeah and it's not just

657
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:34,970
that it's like this project has become

658
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:38,720
so huge that you make so many weird

659
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:40,939
mistakes like someone works on some code

660
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,740
and then someone else is continuing to

661
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,499
work on it and then you create some

662
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:48,788
weird things like of you can't really

663
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:52,279
see that well you would you will feel

664
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:56,029
you can see it in the PDF that you can

665
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:58,579
download later on so basically these are

666
00:47:56,029 --> 00:48:01,309
three commits that I just looked up

667
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:03,230
because I remembered this was like why

668
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:05,239
is this thing not working that's that's

669
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,890
crazy it was working and why is it not

670
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:09,859
working anymore and then turns out the

671
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:13,788
evident strcmp which is using the wrong

672
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:16,609
size and then I changed it but it has a

673
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:20,509
double negation in it code like you know

674
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:23,390
I fixed it incorrectly and then I fixed

675
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:26,930
it but it turned out that the sticks was

676
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:29,239
I mean the compare was working but the

677
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:32,029
actual code wasn't actually expecting to

678
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:34,039
get all these devices this piece of code

679
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:35,869
is basically telling us oh this is you

680
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,420
reading well so let's check if it's in

681
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:41,809
Apple device and so on but this was just

682
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:44,150
giving us all the devices and basically

683
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:46,759
the last commit on the right which you

684
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,940
cannot really see had like like just

685
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:52,309
drop all of it and you know have it

686
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,440
straight from from the start the

687
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:57,349
previous compares were just looking for

688
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,359
something that would never occur so I

689
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:01,220
went to zoom in something is wrong in

690
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,808
the exploit but it wasn't the case it

691
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,259
was just not finding the device at the

692
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:06,920
point

693
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,630
and and if you you know take like a few

694
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,180
days to figure out why it's not working

695
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:14,570
it's like really disappointing sometimes

696
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:18,669
but you know that's how it goes it's not

697
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:21,650
it's not also I mean it's not just like

698
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:27,830
simple human errors it's more because

699
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:29,540
Linux is very different and it's a

700
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,509
dependency how if you want to support

701
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:35,690
multiple platforms and if you want to

702
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:37,580
make a universal app like you know you

703
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:38,210
cannot just support all of them in an

704
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,000
easy way

705
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:43,790
the reason is that usually there's also

706
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,120
licensing issues that you have to take

707
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:50,900
into account so yeah I wrote like three

708
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:53,120
million 149 377 easy steps that's

709
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,190
obviously just like a made-up number but

710
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,680
it took really a long time to figure

711
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:03,500
something out and we basically said

712
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:06,410
let's just focus on a small small number

713
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:12,500
of platforms that we want to support by

714
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:17,149
using GT k3 with some like in the

715
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:19,970
practice that user can install but still

716
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:22,490
conforming to the licenses but for the

717
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:25,609
broader audience like general Linux

718
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:29,569
usage the solution that we came up with

719
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:34,510
was a static build that still complies

720
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:38,440
with all the licenses so check-rein nine

721
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:43,220
zero nine eight ship with an emphasis UI

722
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:46,130
and also web brain which is like using

723
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,080
and curses and that makes it available

724
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,700
through the web browser which could be

725
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:53,180
really interesting to use on like

726
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:58,460
embedded devices yeah and this is

727
00:50:53,180 --> 00:51:01,339
something that Daniel is on ski and me

728
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,830
spend lots of time on to to get this UI

729
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,590
working

730
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:09,040
the idea basically started at the CCC

731
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:11,850
Congress last year I mean or shortly

732
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:18,220
before but I spent quite some time to

733
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:21,580
create the UI but it turned out that was

734
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:25,120
the best choice that we could make yeah

735
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,759
when ETA Windows version so this is

736
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:33,190
still being work on the exploit itself

737
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:36,970
works but it needs still some some work

738
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:43,210
to package it up properly to make a UI

739
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:45,819
that is well comparable to the quality

740
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:49,840
standards that we made up for the other

741
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:54,430
versions windows uses for the Windows

742
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:57,910
version we're using USB K stack for the

743
00:51:54,430 --> 00:52:00,040
D few part it also supports like the

744
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:03,460
partial control transfers that we need

745
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,529
and the release is coming but it's ready

746
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:07,660
when it's ready I cannot say it's ready

747
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:11,800
tomorrow I was hoping we would finish it

748
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:15,009
until today but it still needs a bit of

749
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,870
work unfortunately but well we have the

750
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:21,190
other versions and you know who is using

751
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:23,109
Windows anyway so yeah but what's new

752
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:26,080
with check-rein like what has happening

753
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:29,470
in the past month

754
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:33,750
so I already mentioned that we published

755
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:38,919
a Linux version with zero nine eight

756
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:44,050
with emphasis in web Wing and it now

757
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:47,410
uses in a bungalow s and also the crown

758
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:50,440
of head finder is a pongo module and

759
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:52,629
since zero nine eight one check print

760
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,670
also supports to load custom images that

761
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,670
would use instead of from Google Earth

762
00:52:54,670 --> 00:53:02,400
like you can create your own operating

763
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:02,400
system if you want and start there and

764
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:09,370
also the internally used one starting in

765
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:12,729
this version supports to load another

766
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:15,219
custom bootloader well and this is

767
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:18,009
oh sorry another side so what's wrong

768
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:21,309
with us I just mention it Congress is

769
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:22,900
the mini operating system the the name

770
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:23,769
of the mini operating system that we

771
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,679
came up with

772
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:28,718
it's a customs really small modular

773
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:29,079
low-level operating system that starts

774
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:34,809
from

775
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:37,420
DFU mode yeah well for specifically for

776
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:39,489
Apple hardware it allows to bootstrap

777
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:44,890
the device for other operating systems

778
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:48,160
and it's also open source since a few

779
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:51,429
days so and we're still working on that

780
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:54,069
to you know get more device support and

781
00:53:51,429 --> 00:54:00,189
there will still be a few updates coming

782
00:53:54,069 --> 00:54:03,579
for this and also yeah you we could

783
00:54:00,189 --> 00:54:09,189
already we already have like Linux that

784
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:12,670
runs on top of fungal OS and in a

785
00:54:09,189 --> 00:54:14,469
further development cycle there were a

786
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:18,670
few people that came up with another

787
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:21,609
idea to well create Android for the

788
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:25,959
iPhone and this is what we basically

789
00:54:21,609 --> 00:54:30,029
supported with the latest version so you

790
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:31,890
can now have Android on your iPhone

791
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:38,559
because why not

792
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:40,029
so let's check out a few demos I mean we

793
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,179
have like three minutes left or

794
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:45,880
something or two minutes so I have like

795
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:47,829
three demos and they are like two

796
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,739
minutes each or one minute something

797
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:56,109
each so I think that would be okay

798
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:58,599
so the first demo I want to show is a

799
00:54:56,109 --> 00:55:01,269
battery power mini computer it's the

800
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:05,610
Nano PI and for which comes with nice

801
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:09,520
features like USB 3

802
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:13,290
you USB controller a dedicated one not

803
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:16,690
one of these integrated crappy OTG ones

804
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:19,540
and also it actually has an nvme adapter

805
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:22,150
to can put like a SSD in it which is

806
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:27,870
quite nice but that's not used for this

807
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:30,450
scenario so let's see okay yeah

808
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:34,390
[Music]

809
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:39,160
so no check-rein up there I'm locked

810
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:42,339
into the Wi-Fi of this nano PI and I'm

811
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:45,430
starting the command line version the

812
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:51,610
Empress's UI version which will now put

813
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:53,649
the device into recovery mode first it

814
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:55,300
could also be totally automated like you

815
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:58,840
don't have to lock you know anything but

816
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:02,050
it's it requires some timing to handle

817
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:06,130
the actual give you reset sequence so

818
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:07,720
you want to be able to control that well

819
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:12,400
I'm until we figure out a better way to

820
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:15,399
do it but yeah so now I'm entering the

821
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,550
View mode and then you will see a brain

822
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,090
[Music]

823
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:33,400
yeah and forgive you more successfully

824
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:37,750
and now it's exploiting there you go all

825
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:40,170
from the custom linux version on the

826
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,170
nano PI

827
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,480
okay

828
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:50,800
it will now put into the normal

829
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:55,450
operating system and then here all done

830
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,450
now you can see the check-rein app I

831
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:07,370
managed to find the home button yep so

832
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:13,310
that works okay next time on let's

833
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:19,370
actually the windows demo that was first

834
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:22,430
showed at blue hat il months ago about a

835
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:26,509
month ago yeah for like two weeks or

836
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:32,220
something you can see it's still like

837
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:37,320
using text mode for the actual procedure

838
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,319
[Music]

839
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:58,370
recovery mode not will go into the View

840
00:57:50,360 --> 00:58:01,280
mode by the way there's also something

841
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:04,520
really critical to this exploit because

842
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,350
people seem to assume that it doesn't

843
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,600
matter how you enter the View mode but

844
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,250
it turns out that it's very critical how

845
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,560
you enter the give you mode because it

846
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:15,980
can end up in this in a state that is

847
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:21,080
not clean enough and then the exploit

848
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:24,200
might failure so it still requires like

849
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:28,370
the best way to enter it which is what

850
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,509
we implemented in the actual app - yeah

851
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:34,900
to have the most clean stage for the

852
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,900
exploit

853
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:40,700
okay yeah

854
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:47,570
the experts already worked and the

855
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:53,240
device is booting quickly write down the

856
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:56,330
passcode yeah and there's two check

857
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:59,330
right now okay and one more demo and

858
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:01,970
then we're done we can have Android on

859
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:03,680
the iPhone and let's check it out so I

860
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:06,500
already did the first part which

861
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,450
downloads the image onto the device to

862
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,790
for later use

863
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,040
but it took like fourteen minutes to

864
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:15,680
download on the slow hotel Wi-Fi so I

865
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,779
don't want to keep you waiting with that

866
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:21,290
it basically creates a partition on the

867
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:24,860
device puts the nand image the android

868
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:29,090
and image on it and then when you run

869
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:31,670
the when you run the the actual start

870
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:34,310
sequence this sequence it will run the

871
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:39,610
it will use the checkpoint app to enter

872
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:42,950
congo OS drop to the Pongo s shell and

873
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:48,230
since we added the new capabilities to

874
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:52,730
allow uploading good images over USB and

875
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:56,120
Pongo OS shell mode we can have it

876
00:59:52,730 --> 01:00:00,010
upload from the command line here we can

877
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:02,390
have it upload the Android bootloader

878
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:05,240
this is what the script is basically

879
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:09,770
doing it starts the checkpoint app which

880
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:13,220
expects it in to be in DFU mode it loads

881
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:16,670
from west and in shell mode and then it

882
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:19,850
uploads the image and now we will see

883
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:21,850
something different happening this is

884
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:24,660
just bongu s4 now

885
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:35,860
I first started failed but there you go

886
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:37,569
to course Linux good that's quite fast I

887
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,280
mean this is an iPhone 7 which is the

888
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:42,880
first device that is supported the

889
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:45,070
others still require a bit of work and

890
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:49,170
by the way we did not create the

891
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:54,310
androids image it's from the guy from

892
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:58,090
from for aliens that from hired and also

893
01:00:54,310 --> 01:01:00,850
open sourced the the Android build they

894
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:02,140
call it project sandcastle that's

895
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:04,330
project sand castle

896
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:06,480
org where you can download the image and

897
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:09,400
as you can see you have a running

898
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,390
Android the home button does not work by

899
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:15,530
the way as you could see in the video

900
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:17,250
yeah that's it

901
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:20,050
[Music]

902
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:22,540
[Applause]

903
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:24,720
thank you for sharing your knowledge any

904
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:30,940
questions

905
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:37,390
when do ta windows no no questions yeah

906
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:40,960
yes hello hi

907
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:42,879
so like ice power armor just-joan

908
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,780
architecture it says that there should

909
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:49,780
be dedicated RAM memory and bus for the

910
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:52,410
trust processing but here we are saying

911
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:55,180
that like only Rome is separate and

912
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:57,040
buses registers and all memories being

913
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:01,480
said because of that only we have this

914
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:03,009
path for exploitation right I didn't

915
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,700
understand the full question actually

916
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:08,800
okay so basically what I am talking like

917
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:13,210
are Freud that Russian architecture

918
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:15,880
which it says that the processing costs

919
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:17,950
secured part should be with the sacred

920
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,390
crypto accelerator processor memory

921
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:25,180
registers and dedicated buses and

922
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:28,089
general purpose OS and hardware unit can

923
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,980
only request for okay just verify me

924
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,420
whether I'm right or not just tell me

925
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:34,150
about that these things are trusted or

926
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:37,660
not this is the expected what arm trust

927
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:39,850
John says but here we say that accept

928
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:41,620
secure ROM everything is shared because

929
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:46,390
of that only we could pass through with

930
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:48,400
this exploit yeah because when you have

931
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:51,190
caught execution in secure ROM you can

932
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,620
bypass the security checks you can

933
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:57,070
supply another boot image and it will

934
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:59,140
not check I mean the code that checks is

935
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:01,480
for the signature it's just wiped out so

936
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:04,690
it's just not and then you can just look

937
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,970
whatever you want okay I think I hope

938
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,370
that answered the question

939
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,839
yeah somehow like what I understood like

940
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:13,720
this yes these things are being said

941
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:16,930
that's the only reason it could give the

942
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:19,060
path for exploiting the earth yeah and

943
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:21,549
because it you basically break the the

944
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:25,210
first link of the secure boot chain and

945
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:27,070
then you know you can have like all the

946
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:30,090
following steps are the following

947
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:34,720
bootloader images you can basically

948
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:37,420
break the integrity integrity checks and

949
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,580
then you can load like the next level

950
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:41,530
good loader and then can like what we

951
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:44,920
did we created the Congo glass which is

952
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:46,950
like completely custom like totally from

953
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,950
scratch

954
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:53,130
code execution and creating like an

955
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:57,130
operating system environments

956
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:58,630
yeah and since it's modular and it's

957
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,750
also open source you can start writing

958
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:04,660
your own modules we are about to release

959
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:10,090
a new version which will have a module

960
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:12,819
that basically disables the well or ena

961
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:15,760
was access to the AES engine so we can

962
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,380
use that to decrypt some images which

963
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,560
was something really critical in the

964
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:22,120
past because as you see you need an

965
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,360
exploit to actually get access to it

966
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:29,380
because the first thing that does about

967
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:31,900
disable access to the the AES keys that

968
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:34,210
are used for the firmware signing so

969
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,940
when the device is booted and this patch

970
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,010
will basically allow user mode access to

971
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,080
these kids

972
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:48,600
so quite some interesting changes coming

973
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:48,600
up research-wise yes any more questions

974
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:56,880
no okay thanks for your time

975
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:01,899
[Applause]
