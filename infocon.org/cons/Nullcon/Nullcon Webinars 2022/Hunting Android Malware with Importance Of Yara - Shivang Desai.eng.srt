6
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,439
uh his research blogs have been

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,080
referenced by major international media

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,040

so today's station is related to

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
uh hunting android malware in the wild

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
so let me start this thing just one

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479

perfect

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,799
so okay so today's session is on hunting

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,640
android malware is in the white so i'm

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
sure on design

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,439
and

41
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
who am i so sakshi gave a pretty good

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,360
introduction for me so thank you for

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,520
that so let me quickly run through this

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,639
slide so i'm security researcher aka

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,120
engineer you can say i sometimes reverse

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
things i sometimes build things so

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
that's what i prefer to call myself

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
security researcher as well as engineer

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
i have seven plus years of experience

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
i recently joined microsoft and i had

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
been working in c-scaler prior to

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,239
joining microsoft

53
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,959
and i'm an avid blogger and speaker at

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,440
hacking conferences like nalcon

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,400
award and accounting it's just started

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
and that's my twitter handle if you guys

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
would like to follow me

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,000
so it's 5h1 and vang

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
so yeah what to expect today right

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
so first part we'll have a quick sneak

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
peek into what android and malware is so

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
yeah it's definitely not a malware

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
analysis session so we'll have a quick

64
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
introduction of both and then we'll see

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
what is yara a small introduction of

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
yara and in second part we'll be having

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
a look at uh using yara for hunting

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
android markers and that's what all the

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,920
session is today about and we'll see

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
some live scenarios i'll uh if time

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
permits i'll show you some of the demos

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
also

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
so yep why android so android is

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
everywhere guys if you see uh i have

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
seen a whole lot of smart

76
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,760
televisions which run on android but

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
very less on ios i suppose none

78
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,799
uh so it's in mobile devices it's in

79
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,599
smart watches it's almost everywhere

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,120
there are several app stores which

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
remain overlooked like if you guys know

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,760
uh everyone knows google play store

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
right there are a lot of malwares that

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,959
we you know hunt on play store but there

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,680
we have amazon app store we have samsung

86
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
app store we have one mobile i think

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
it's chinese app store major app store

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,959
and almost all oem right if you take mi

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,959
mobile xiaomi mobiles they have their

90
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
own app stores so there are almost all

91
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,319
oem who have their own app stores and

92
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,480
yeah recent big news for windows 11 is

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,159
coming up within build android support

94
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,480
right so that inbuilt android is i think

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
are not i think but it's your amazon app

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
store so there's a huge opportunity so

97
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,920
android and malware are everywhere but

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
not many researchers are there to help

99
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
in this field right

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,720
so why android malware why did i choose

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
android malware if you ask so if you see

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,880
this slide from g gdatasoftware.com

103
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
so they say that

104
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,400
they come across more than 10 000 new

105
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
malicious apps per day according to

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
their survey and they find they found an

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
uh infected app android app every eight

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
seconds that's huge right and nowadays

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
if you see news right though it would be

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
new abstract if you if you read this

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,199
headlines it's new abstract mo android

112
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
malware it sees its total control of

113
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,680
your device and it evades detection

114
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,440
then a recent

115
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
block came across which was new android

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
malware steals millions of infecting 10

117
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
millions of millions after infecting 10

118
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
million phones

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,639
uh then google had this warning for

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,199
google samsung's play store

121
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,039
and there are many many news which you

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
see every day

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,039
right so that's all about android and a

124
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
quick sneak peek into malware let's

125
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
start with what is yara

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
uh i suppose you all are from security

127
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
background so somewhere down the line

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
you might have heard about what is yara

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,680
so this is the mastermind victor alvarez

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
who started or who designed yara so it's

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
nothing it's it's not very complicated

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
it's a tool specifically designed for

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,759
malware research and detection and it

134
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,240
simply follows rule-based approach i'll

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
uh as the slice approach i'll show you

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
how what is rule uh and how yara works

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
so to in very less language you can say

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
yaris to files what's not is to network

139
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
traffic right so you write snot rules to

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
detect network traffic similarly you

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
write yara rules it's simple stream

142
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,800
based tools to detect files

143
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,600
so how does yara work right it has two

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,479
fold benefits so first of all you have

145
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
some yara rules that you have designed

146
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
uh personally you have designed or you

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
have got it from uh third-party sources

148
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
you have a app say for example any

149
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,360
software or apk or app anything like

150
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,160
that

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
you input both of them in yara engine

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
and as an output you get categorization

153
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
as it is malicious or

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
benign so whether the app is malicious

155
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
or whether it's a safe app based on what

156
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
yara rules you have designed

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,360
so what's the second fold benefit so if

158
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
you know uh that the app or software is

159
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,759
definitely a malware but you want to

160
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
identify which family it uh it belongs

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
to so what you can do is you can design

162
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
yara rule so designing yara rules is

163
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,599
very critical we'll

164
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,319
see how it is very important and again

165
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
you can send in malware along with yara

166
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
rules into yara engine

167
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
and as a categorization as an output you

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
will get which malware family it belongs

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
to

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
so basic yara rule so guys if you have

171
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,880
any question as sakshi said right you

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,479
can uh just chat typing in the chat and

173
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,080
we'll have it have a look at those

174
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,039
questions at the q a session at the end

175
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,520
so let's see now how a basic yara rule

176
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
looks like

177
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
so this is a very simple yara rule very

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,319
basic url

179
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
written for a ransomware detection

180
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,039
so say for example string one this is

181
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,039
this is how it looks like first is

182
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,479
identifier

183
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
which is important

184
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,639
second is a string section which is

185
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,080
optional and third is condition section

186
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,199
so

187
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,919
if you see uh this is basic kyara rule

188
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,840
which has this rule strings condition

189
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,000
and a closing bracket

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
so you can do this

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
uh say for example yara

192
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
ransomware dot yara this rule is named

193
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,919
as say ransomware.yara and you uh set up

194
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,879
uh

195
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,680
the software or app as i told you right

196
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,479
at the end and you fire uh yara it will

197
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
tell you uh if this file.txc is a

198
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
ransomware or not so this is just an

199
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
example this is very basic rule uh just

200
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,520
for an example of understanding

201
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,479
uh real rules are actually uh very uh

202
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
you know in design in a very appropriate

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,919
way this is just for an example

204
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,240
but there's a huge but here there's a

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
problem uh what's that problem

206
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,039
so long back when i started researching

207
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,559
on yara i really liked the concept which

208
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,000
people were using with windows

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
especially exes right so as we saw in

210
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,240
previous example yara then rule file and

211
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,919
then the exe

212
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
but when i was talking with victor uh

213
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
who actually developed this uh software

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
or framework so he told that yara

215
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
doesn't support uh doesn't offer the

216
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
support for apk right why is it so

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399
because yara is not a single uh sorry

218
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
apk is not a single entity uh it is a

219
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
binary which in itself has a lot of uh

220
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
uh compressed files right if you guys

221
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
have worked on android you know right if

222
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,120
you use apk tool and you reverse the apk

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
you'll get a lot of resource folders

224
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
asset folders and there's a the

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
certificate related information then

226
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
there's a smallly related folder so yara

227
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
fails over there

228
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,519
so

229
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,839
what now yeah we we need to find

230
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,320
solution for this problem so what we did

231
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
was we can uh build a

232
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
in-house framework where what you can do

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,279
you can decompile an apk you can fetch

234
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
required data as a single into a single

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
entity you can say a dump file or

236
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
anything

237
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
and then file yara rules on that single

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
entity because you have to understand

239
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
yara initially used to work with a

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
single input

241
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,360
or else what you can do is you can use a

242
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
feature called module in yara so what

243
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
you would have to do you have to use

244
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,760
endocard and generate a json report and

245
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
according to the json report you could

246
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
have

247
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,920
sending uncompressed folder of apk and

248
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,360
your yara rules

249
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
so this is a bit tricky right so you

250
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,760
might be thinking okay so this is going

251
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,800
all very fast and how do we do this so

252
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
don't worry guys you don't have to worry

253
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
in recent days you don't have to worry

254
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,680
about all this you definitely can uh

255
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,959
build your own

256
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
framework if you want to as i told you

257
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
right building an in-house framework or

258
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
you can use android

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
module but for hunting apks in the while

260
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
you don't have to worry as of now for

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
this

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,320
so let's take yara to the y right so

263
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
we'll see first what wireless total is

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,000
uh i'm definitely sure

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,279
of you know what 99.99 total is it's an

266
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
online service that allows you to you

267
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,839
know upload a file or search for hashes

268
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,200
or anything related to malicious

269
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
contents and second what we'll see is

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,560
kudos.com so these guys were uh this guy

271
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,880
started the project i think so five to

272
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,040
six years ago and it's a fantastic

273
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
project that i came across it's a

274
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
collaborative platform that combines the

275
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
power of online analysis tools with

276
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
social interactions between the analysts

277
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,040
what path vast apks apk repositories so

278
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
down the line we'll see both of the

279
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,959
panels how they look what we have to do

280
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
how we have to do and where we have to

281
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,720
write yara rules how we have to write

282
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
url so a lot of things a lot of things

283
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,000
to cover so i might go a little bit fast

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
but we just have 30 minutes right so

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,839
let's run

286
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
so kudos.com as i told you is uh the url

287
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
is kudos.com kwdous

288
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,079
it uses endocard module in itself as we

289
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,839
as i told you in previous slide right

290
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
they use android and modules and what

291
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
they'll do is uh you don't have to worry

292
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
about any json report they inbuilt use

293
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
the android module and and prepare json

294
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
report of different types

295
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,399
so say for example they'll provide you

296
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
an api so now if you want to search for

297
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,760
package name of a android app what you

298
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
can do is enter that dot package name

299
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
and then string or a regex format

300
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
if you want to find app name you can go

301
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
as android dot app name for certificate

302
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,000
similarly endocard dot certificate dot

303
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
sha and then string

304
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
so this this uh site you can note on now

305
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
or at the end of the slide i have

306
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
kept this all the important links in

307
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,440
that slide and i will share the slides

308
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
soon after the presentation so no need

309
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
to note down right now but you can visit

310
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,839
this site and there's whole list of api

311
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,839
what you can

312
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,480
use then comes wireless total so

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
virustotal has this feature of bt

314
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,279
hunting so yeah virus total for using

315
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
this you'll have to be on enterprise

316
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,360
suit and kudos.com is free so i have

317
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
taken both the examples one is free and

318
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,639
one is commercial

319
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,240
so vt hunting

320
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
is a tool you can say which is used by

321
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,519
virustotal uh it has two types of

322
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
categorization you can say it's

323
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,839
retrovent and liveon so what retro hunt

324
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,959
is

325
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,959
retrohunt is basically till date

326
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
whatever uh applications that virus

327
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,320
total has so if you want to search in

328
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
the past then you can use or you can

329
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,880
design a yara rule and start a retrohand

330
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
job i will say this as well

331
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,399
and uh virus total says they have 600 tb

332
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,920
right not not gb guys it's tv so 600 tb

333
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,040
of uh

334
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,839
this

335
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
whole lot of collections and your yara

336
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
rule will fire on all the apps that has

337
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
been present in the past

338
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,639
and opposite to that is live hunt so

339
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,639
what you can do is you can design a yara

340
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,399
rule and just

341
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,880
place it in virus total and whenever a

342
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,600
new file is uploaded on virus total or a

343
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
reanalysis happens

344
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
your yara rule will

345
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,600
run in the background and if the hit if

346
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,519
the hit is happening then you will get a

347
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,519
notification

348
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,800
so endoguard uses kudos uses endoguard

349
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
module

350
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,320
similarly wireless total uses bt module

351
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
so what is that

352
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,880
so

353
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
say for example you just want to hunt

354
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
for apk files so you can use this thing

355
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
vt.meta data.file type is equal to

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
vt.file type android

357
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
now say i want to search for all the

358
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
apks that have been submitted from china

359
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,680
then you can use something similar like

360
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
this so just just grab this basic things

361
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,959
at the end of this presentation i i

362
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,560
can assure you that you will know how

363
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
and where to use all this

364
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,560
so this is again uh the link where you

365
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,880
can see how to write uh

366
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
yara rules for

367
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
live hunt and all the api all the

368
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,199
syntaxes are present in this

369
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,240
url

370
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
again it has been mentioned in the last

371
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
last slide

372
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,519
so now let's have a quick look at yara

373
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,399
rules

374
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,519
yara root panel i can say

375
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,320
so can you

376
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
just again confirm whether you can see

377
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
the second tab yeah i can

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,320
okay so guys this is uh kudos.com okay

379
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
and kudos.com it's simple the

380
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
registration is simple you just have to

381
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,600
provide your

382
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
email id whether it's corporate personal

383
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,839
personal doesn't matter

384
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,759
username it should be unique and

385
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,279
password and

386
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,519
confirmation of a password that's it and

387
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,079
you can authenticate here basically

388
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
login is

389
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
for login what they say is

390
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
authentication authenticate yourself so

391
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
once you have logged in this is the

392
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
panel that you will be able to see

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
so here if you see there are a lot of

394
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,399
researchers uh who are on to

395
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
kudos.com if you see here they have like

396
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,680
86 million right it is 6 million if i am

397
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,240
not wrong 86 million apps

398
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,800
so if you go here apks they have this

399
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
showing results of 86 million three

400
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
something something it's a long number

401
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
huge number

402
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,399
and if you want to search for any such

403
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
efforts

404
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,279
particular apk you can go say facebook

405
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
and it will give you facebook related

406
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,639
all the apps that have been uploaded

407
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
here if you want to check for flu bot

408
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
malware you can search here for bluebot

409
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
related app that has been uh uploaded

410
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,440
here

411
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,920
and again they will uh here all the

412
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,440
researchers you know they have this

413
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,920
input or say let's let's take an example

414
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,120
of this

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
right

416
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
so if you see here uh two of the

417
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,959
researchers have told that this is

418
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
actually a

419
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
malicious app

420
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,160
uh so this panel you can explore uh what

421
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
right now is of importance is on the

422
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,120
left hand side which is this rule sets

423
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
right we have community rule sets and we

424
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
have my rule sets so here my rule sets

425
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
we'll see how to write

426
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
rules specifically in next upcoming

427
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
slides so this is the panel that is

428
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,919
important for this presentation so new

429
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,599
my new rule set

430
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
similarly you can go here in community

431
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
rule set say for example you want to

432
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,760
search for a specific again let's say

433
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
schlubot related yara rule

434
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,880
right so yeah perfect we have this one

435
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
rule which is detecting two zero nine

436
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
zero apks

437
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,839
so

438
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,880
this is kudos.com okay community rule

439
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
says my rule sets and second comes virus

440
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,960
total so once you have logged in into

441
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
virus total if you see here on the top

442
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
left corner there is a tab called

443
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
hunting

444
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
now here we have if you if you hover

445
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
your mouse over here we have this panel

446
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
which is important for us right now

447
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
which is live and rule sets and retro

448
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
hunt so that is basically retro and live

449
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,960
hunt

450
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,280
so if you go to live hunt

451
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
then you can create here your rule set

452
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,280
and will assist you with uh writing a

453
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
you can say template which you can

454
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,919
readily use to write a rule uh we'll

455
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,760
write a rule right now in next two

456
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,200
minutes okay and you can uh note down

457
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
your

458
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
input your email id and say for example

459
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
if i input an email id here and if this

460
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,919
yara rule hits on any of the file which

461
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,600
is being uploaded on wireless or

462
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,039
re-analyzed then you'll get a

463
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,679
notification like hey shivang your rule

464
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,520
has been hit

465
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,480
with so and so apk right

466
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,200
so that's basically uh live hunt and

467
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
retrovent again nothing much to see here

468
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
uh you can just create your first retro

469
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,080
and job here you will see you will have

470
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,760
to input your yara rule uh and la past

471
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,679
what what time range do you want to see

472
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,320
right last 30 days 90 days 365 days or

473
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
custom range and your email id and

474
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,840
create job so it i think so it takes

475
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
three to four hours minimum for scanning

476
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,679
for one year and you'll get notification

477
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,440
in your email id

478
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,000
so that basically is a a quick look at

479
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
the panel just for uh introduction type

480
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
of thing let's get back to our

481
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,360
second part mostly i can say the second

482
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
part starts now

483
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
so here let's take an example right as

484
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,919
as i told you in the introduction you

485
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,960
might have

486
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
read the intro about this webinar right

487
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
what will you do if you don't have a

488
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,400
hold of that particular app so let's

489
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
just take an example

490
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,679
let me go to the site

491
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,080
this is a

492
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
this is a uh one of the blog that i

493
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,559
wrote back in seascaler it was related

494
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
to a spyware which was portraying itself

495
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,720
as tiktok

496
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,039
this was a major boom when when this

497
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,520
tiktok was banned so let's let's assume

498
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
that you are reading this blog and i

499
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
have mentioned the hash here but just

500
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,799
assume that you don't have i haven't

501
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,640
mentioned uh hash or any kind of

502
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
data right for this thing so what is the

503
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
package name is there and if you are

504
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,240
reading a blog for android apk malware

505
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,480
as you will see we have a lot of uh

506
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
what to say screenshots available right

507
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,600
so what you can do is you can search for

508
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
strings which are unique to this malware

509
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
right so say for example we have this

510
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
package name we have app name so as of

511
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,440
now just consider we don't have hash

512
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
right now with us

513
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
so we have package name if you come down

514
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,159
below uh there are a lot of uh this is

515
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,200
kind of a

516
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
command it connects with command and

517
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,320
control center and on the basis of what

518
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,520
commands it receives uh it can uh you

519
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,760
know act accordingly so we have a huge

520
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
list of commands if you see down here

521
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
these are all unique

522
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,960
uh what i have used is uh the services

523
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
and receivers that were being used here

524
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,280
say for example alarm receiver intercept

525
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
call right so

526
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,679
once you are reading this app a blog and

527
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
you don't have the hash or control of

528
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
the apk what you can do is you can

529
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,200
select specific strings

530
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,679
and just note it down in a notepad

531
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
and now what you can do is

532
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
this is scenario what i explained right

533
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
assume no sample has provided in block

534
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,720
or say hash is provided but you don't uh

535
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,799
know where is it in the while you search

536
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
on virus total you search on kudos but

537
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,039
you don't have that so what you can do

538
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,799
is

539
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,360
as i told you let's select some strings

540
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
here and package name was this

541
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
uh it checks for sms's because it saw a

542
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
spyware so it was basically stealing uh

543
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
one of the feature was stealing uh sms's

544
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,559
so in order to look for sms

545
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
this is basically a string which is

546
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
uniquely used by each and every malware

547
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,240
which is say content sms inbox app

548
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,679
sorry app is ticktock pro receiver was

549
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,159
intercept call and another receiver

550
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,960
alarm receiver so guys this the example

551
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
that i'm showing is of a very basic rule

552
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,480
so you might get a question like okay

553
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
is this enough

554
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
so i can say it's not enough but it's

555
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
okay to write a basic rule right you

556
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,720
don't have to worry about that so let's

557
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,840
first see how our simple rule looks like

558
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,559
for

559
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,280
kudos okay so a little bit of syntax

560
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
form changes will be there but by the

561
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
time you get grasp of yara rules uh this

562
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
will be easy for you to uh you know

563
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,280
design

564
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
so as i told you it has a unique

565
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,360
identifier which is rule uh space tick

566
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
tock spyware you can give any name that

567
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,799
you want

568
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,080
a starting

569
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,360
bracket

570
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,200
and strings say for example you want

571
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,640
content sms inbox and for conditions we

572
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,679
want android dot package name so in

573
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,919
initial slides i said right it uses and

574
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,080
kudos uses endoguard package

575
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,799
so

576
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,760
endocard dot package name uh this and

577
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,480
endocard dot app name this

578
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,520
android.receiver here again we are using

579
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
regex so it is intercept call you can

580
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,679
also use complete string which was

581
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,679
com.example.tag.e8ndoserverx.interceptcall

582
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,919
and similarly undercut.receiver alarm

583
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,799
and

584
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,159
this end

585
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,000
is important here if you write you can

586
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,679
use and or not there are various

587
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
strings that you can use here

588
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
this can be found in again in the yara

589
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,320
documentation

590
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,440
so let's see how this rule we can input

591
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,960
in kudos

592
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,840
right so

593
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,720
let me just copy this thing quickly

594
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,159
one second

595
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,520
let's go to kudos again here on the left

596
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,919
hand side rule sets my rule sets will

597
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,960
open up this panel you can go to

598
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
new rule set

599
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
and here this is basically a template

600
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,559
that it provides and it has a lot of

601
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,520
things

602
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,480
to explore as i told you endless file

603
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,159
right but

604
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,320
this in 30 minutes i won't be able to

605
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,000
show you each and everything because

606
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
each panel requires a individual

607
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,919
webinar so if time permits in future

608
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,919
we'll do that so you can just remove

609
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,720
this

610
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
you can input your rule here

611
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,240
and

612
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,720
yeah it will give us error because we

613
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,200
haven't imported

614
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
and draw card

615
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,159
modules okay and here you can click in

616
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,080
for giving a name

617
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,919
you can say tick

618
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,799
tock spyware it's fine you can give any

619
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,559
name

620
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,120
it just should be easily

621
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,559
identifiable

622
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
and it is it is disabled so you can

623
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,720
click here to activate it

624
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
you can promote the rule so it can reach

625
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,400
to other researchers as well

626
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,360
and

627
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
here

628
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,880
it will take time just allow itself to

629
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,840
run and once you after a few hours you

630
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
can go here show detections and it will

631
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,039
give you if whether this kudos has any

632
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,279
app which is you know hitting this rule

633
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,600
or not okay so you can keep the rule

634
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
private if you don't want to share it

635
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
with others you can disable the rule if

636
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,279
it is giving you kind of some kind of

637
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,840
false positives and if you don't want to

638
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
get bothered uh in your email you can

639
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,919
just go here on the right hand side is

640
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,120
do not do not notify so once this is

641
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,520
done if you go back

642
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,640
so it will

643
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,000
you can see here

644
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
your rule is in action now and it is

645
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,080
active right

646
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,840
so that's a basic example of

647
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,480
kudos

648
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,559
let's quickly back

649
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,520
to our slides

650
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,000
and

651
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,120
okay so here is a wireless total example

652
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,200
so virus total

653
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
things are a bit easier on writing yara

654
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
rules you can just directly use a

655
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,120
package name sorry strings here

656
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,679
and if you want to make your rule uh

657
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,480
kind of strong then you can use vt

658
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,559
module we'll see in next example how to

659
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,080
use vt module

660
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,559
so let's see a demo quickly for this

661
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,520
thing

662
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
uh

663
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,159
we do have

664
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,480
some time

665
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,520
so

666
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
please feel free if we are running out

667
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,679
of time or if i have just few seconds

668
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,120
left okay

669
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
okay

670
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,799
so

671
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,158
okay so quickly let me

672
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,600
copy this rule for virustotal

673
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,240
let's go to virus total

674
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,400
and here on the left hand side we can go

675
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
to live one tool cells first see live

676
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
one

677
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,039
so new rule set or here or here both of

678
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,559
them are same

679
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,720
create your first rule set again one

680
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,799
fantastic thing is it they provide you

681
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,080
with a

682
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,120
template

683
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,679
but we won't be using that

684
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,760
so here is your rule for

685
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
uh this thing spyware on virustotal

686
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,200
you can say for example

687
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,080
what i have seen in past is uh you might

688
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
not get an you know app with exactly

689
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,360
name as tick tock pro so what you can do

690
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
is say for example you want to find

691
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,919
variants which are similar to this so

692
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,640
you can just remove a package app name

693
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
and you can go with this package name so

694
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,440
i found out this was similar to spymax

695
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,760
and spy note right so they have this

696
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,880
common

697
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
package name and they have this all the

698
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,320
app so basically spy max and spy note

699
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,039
variants are built using a framework or

700
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,039
you can say a software in which you just

701
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,919
have to give name what you want or say

702
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,799
in our example it was tick-tock pro but

703
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,799
you can go with any random name which is

704
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
famous for an app and in in the

705
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,000
background it will create an apk for you

706
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
which will have a

707
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,960
an app icon which is similar to your app

708
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,640
and an app name

709
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
but remaining else was pretty much

710
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
similar so we can use this thing here

711
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,480
condition all of them which means all

712
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,399
the string should be available in that

713
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,440
apk

714
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,679
you can input here on the right side

715
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,760
right side your email address

716
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,240
and then you can save this rule

717
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
toolset requires name okay so you need

718
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,399
to give a name here

719
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,919
spyware

720
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,559
and save and close

721
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,640
so it will say okay this rule is in

722
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,760
action now so what will happen guys now

723
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
in from today itself from right now

724
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,120
itself if anyone uploads an apk which is

725
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
hitting your yara rule then you will get

726
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,440
a notification like okay we found a

727
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
similar variant what you what you're

728
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,480
looking for

729
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,320
so this is basically you can say from

730
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,039
now to future if you want to go in fast

731
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
what you can do is you can go to retro

732
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,399
hunt

733
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,720
you can create your retro job

734
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,360
again same thing nothing similar you can

735
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,000
just uh paste in your same

736
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,720
app at the same yara rule you can remove

737
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,520
or if you don't you want exact apk then

738
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,159
you can just keep it as it is and again

739
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,640
same all of them apk should be having

740
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
all of this

741
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,360
and you want to see for last 365 days

742
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,039
email address and create job

743
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,000
so here it says starting it will take

744
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
approximately two to three or up to

745
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,039
maybe four or five hours uh to run on

746
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,720
that full cluster of 600 tb right approx

747
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
so once this is started it will go to

748
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,279
100 and if you'll see here on right hand

749
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,240
side if there is any match or not okay

750
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,360
so

751
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,240
now quickly get me to let me show you

752
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,559
another example we just have i think

753
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,960
five six minutes left so that was

754
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
basically uh

755
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,440
hunting of samples if you don't have any

756
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
samples at all you can say don't have

757
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
hash in hand

758
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,600
second let's come to

759
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,480
uh

760
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,679
a kind of fun activity right say you

761
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,760
got a task to track all the samples

762
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,559
targeting pandemic situation so you have

763
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,559
to on second thing is you have to keep

764
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,399
eye for all pivot related android

765
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,559
malwares in the wild uh so what you'll

766
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,559
do right what what's what the first

767
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
thing that comes to your mind

768
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,440
as i told you uh we have this yara rules

769
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,679
which works on strings right so what you

770
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,720
can do is uh we are a bit uh running

771
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,360
late on time so i won't ask you guys to

772
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,679
chime in with me but i was going to ask

773
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,919
you guys to chime in in the chat what

774
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,960
strings do you think of when you know

775
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
when you want to hunt for a covet

776
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
related android malware

777
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,159
so let me quickly go to strings it could

778
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,080
be coveted right the app name could be

779
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,120
covered or vaccine or pandemic

780
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,159
coronavirus omicron so the sky is limit

781
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,320
in this what you want to you know

782
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
creatively think

783
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,159
and say for example that app is sending

784
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,360
sms and then app is reading sms say for

785
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
example this just just a basic uh

786
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,240
template that i want to have a look at

787
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,120
so

788
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
this is a particular rule that you can

789
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,799
go with

790
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,760
and here is a vt module that is in

791
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,640
action so now in vt i don't want my

792
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,760
rules to hit on any of the apks any of

793
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,080
the files right random files so because

794
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,640
this strings can be in a pdf can be in

795
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,039
an exes right so what i want is i want

796
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,000
to make

797
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,360
my rule a bit stronger and i want to hit

798
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,159
those this rule only on ap case so what

799
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,320
i can do is v t dot metadata dot file

800
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,840
type is equal to is equal to v t dot

801
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,880
file dot android and all those strings

802
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,320
okay so

803
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,120
let's see uh virus total demo itself

804
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,519
because

805
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,039
we are a bit

806
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,000
done with the time

807
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,799
coming one second guys

808
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,799
so quickly let me copy this thing

809
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,000
the demo is almost very similar

810
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,279
again here you can go to new retro hunt

811
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,399
job and you know basically going in past

812
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,799
is okay not a good idea but but uh okay

813
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,720
we have now two years of covid with us

814
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,360
so we can definitely go here okay and

815
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,600
again same last 365 create job okay

816
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,760
okay this creates an issue sometimes

817
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,559
while copy pasting okay even in double

818
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,080
quotes

819
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,879
and create job

820
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
okay

821
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,240
and it should be done

822
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,640
okay something is missing

823
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,919
okay something has been missing here i

824
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,799
think so it's already 11 35 so basically

825
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,120
you've got the idea right you can use

826
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,679
the rule here you can create the job or

827
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,320
else say for example uh if we want to go

828
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
with live hunt similarly we can go here

829
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,440
in live one we can create a new rule

830
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,120
uh suppose we might get same error here

831
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,159
as well

832
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,840
but let's see

833
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,799
okay so same error we'll get here also

834
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
i quickly have to see guys what the

835
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,799
error is but okay

836
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,559
ideally we

837
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,120
don't need to import here but i don't

838
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,159
know

839
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,320
the demo god is not very happy with me i

840
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,679
suppose

841
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,840
okay yeah the name of god is happy with

842
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,320
me so there are

843
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,280
minor differences we can have to see

844
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
right because this was the same rule

845
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,599
that we were applying in retrohand but i

846
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,280
need to i need to check why this

847
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
metadata thing is giving me error in

848
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
right to hand maybe some syntax changes

849
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,239
will be required and again same save and

850
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,000
close

851
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,280
so yeah we have our rule here which is

852
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
live and now

853
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,599
any of the apks right which gets

854
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
uploaded somewhere by someone

855
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
intentionally or by by mistake then

856
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,040
we'll get uh you know get hold of that

857
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,159
particular apk and if your yara rule is

858
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,199
designed in a way to you know it's very

859
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,599
proper strong to

860
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,918
hunt for a particular malware then we

861
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,280
might get lucky right so again designing

862
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,079
yara rules is is kind of an art so i

863
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,680
suppose every researcher right every

864
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,000
security each one of you

865
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
is an artist and you have to show some

866
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,520
kind of art in designing yara rules

867
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,079
and yeah sky is the limit so this is

868
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,800
very basic stuff that i showed you

869
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,359
and i think so that we are again running

870
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,520
five minutes six minutes ahead of time

871
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,880
so

872
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,920
you can

873
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,560
bookmark these things uh i i'll share

874
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,200
the link i'll share this pdf also with

875
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,599
you guys so if it's okay if you

876
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,359
immediately want to check some links you

877
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,320
can just

878
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,440
have a look

879
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,359
and i think so we can

880
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,119
end the

881
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,520
session

882
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,880
so thank you srivam for this amazing uh

883
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
informative session and i'm sure our

884
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,880
participants must have found some

885
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,160
important knowledge inputs from it and

886
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,560
uh let's open the

887
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,000
q a session sure yeah just a second let

888
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,160
me just

889
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,839
so we have a question how you deal with

890
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,200
obfuscation by creating yara rule in

891
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,280
other words what is your approach while

892
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
creating yara

893
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,760
okay yeah that's that's a number one

894
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
question that i was expecting related to

895
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
obfuscation so yeah as i told you right

896
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,720
you are the artist and you have to show

897
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
your skills in that so many of times

898
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,760
yeah i agree with you many times package

899
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,800
names anything won't be

900
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
you know won't be

901
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
many of help to you because it's

902
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,599
completely obfuscated so what i do is i

903
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,320
basically reverse the app and try to

904
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,040
search for unique strings right uh you

905
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,280
can you know directly fire strings

906
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,920
command if you are on to went to a

907
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,400
similar linux related machine you can

908
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,800
fire strings command and it will give

909
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
you all the strings you can go and hunt

910
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,400
for a string which you feel is unique to

911
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,440
that particular malware or marvel family

912
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,240
so i'll give you one quick example i

913
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,760
came across this uh uh kind of a family

914
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,720
which was you know every time it was

915
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
generating an apk malware it was

916
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,599
obfuscating package names and

917
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,680
the initial package name was always

918
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,320
obfuscated right but i found one unique

919
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,839
thing which was

920
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,400
it was uh using uh the service name

921
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
which was common so say for example one

922
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,799
apk which is designed will have say

923
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,560
dot com.shiman.example.com particular

924
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,440
say intercept call and same family the

925
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,760
same framework was generating

926
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
exactly same apk team spyware but it

927
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,920
will be now having say com.nulcon dot

928
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,599
something dot something dot intercept

929
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,920
call so likewise you will have to hunt

930
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,560
for that unique string and design a rule

931
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,119
in that way

932
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,960
okay uh we have another question can

933
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
yara be used against an encrypted

934
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,040
protocol

935
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,599
an encrypted protocol

936
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,560
oh that's a good question uh

937
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
i'll have to research it myself because

938
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,400
i majorly been working on apks past many

939
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,119
years so all my research has only been

940
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,760
on apk specifically so

941
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,839
uh that's a good question i myself will

942
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,200
have to you know

943
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,680
look at it

944
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,320
any other question

945
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,680
is it that we lost shakshi or

946
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,200
let me check chat

947
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
so uh

948
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,760
i think uh yeah i think that's

949
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,079
the only two questions that we had uh

950
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,920
folks if you have any other questions

951
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,800
please do post here

952
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,119
oh perfect we did had uh some of the uh

953
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,079
so sorry guys xx uh

954
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,920
i'm really sorry i actually wanted to

955
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
you know ask the strings and everything

956
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,680
uh with you guys but uh i could not

957
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,560
because of time so yeah some of the

958
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,200
strings were direction yeah

959
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,720
that's a good one

960
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,079
uh add meta yeah we can add meta but uh

961
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,079
it's it's kind of optional so if you

962
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,800
want to use hyphen m tag with yara for

963
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,119
additional uh information then yeah

964
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,280
definitely i personally use meta a lot

965
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,079
so so some of the questions were i mean

966
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,960
uh directed to everyone and some i think

967
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,760
were directed to personal chat

968
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,640
yeah so srivang one more question or do

969
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
you have any approach for detecting apk

970
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
malwares which uses dynamic code loading

971
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,760
uh yeah

972
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,079
we will have to search for dynamic code

973
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,960
lighting so you can go with uh load text

974
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,680
or the functions that are being used and

975
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,839
along with that uh some unique string

976
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,480
because you cannot use simple loading

977
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,000
functions right dex loading functions

978
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
you can use

979
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,520
because they are string in itself but

980
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,240
that might create uh false positives a

981
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,400
lot because there are several apks that

982
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,839
do put text loading dynamically so you

983
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,000
can what you can do is you can hunt for

984
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,319
some of the strings which are unique and

985
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,880
available in static part and along with

986
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,359
that you can go for dex loading

987
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,839
functions and again index loading you

988
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,839
will have to mention some kind of

989
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,240
strings right which might be unique if

990
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,160
you are lucky so you can use that along

991
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,280
with this

992
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,240
so again my uh take would be

993
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,440
designing

994
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,079
yara rules is completely upon you and

995
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,240
i think so in the one of the links that

996
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,880
i have gave you uh in last slide it it

997
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,319
contains uh several uh special yara rule

998
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,040
sets so you can find uh if if you are

999
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,160
new to yara you can find uh examples

1000
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
