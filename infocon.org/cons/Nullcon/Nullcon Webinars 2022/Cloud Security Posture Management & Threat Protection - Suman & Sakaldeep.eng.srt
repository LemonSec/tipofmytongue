session thank you thank you sakshi

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,599
thank you saksi uh so i am suman tiwari

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,400
uh this is a joint session a workshop is

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
conducted by sakhaldeep and me

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
the topic that we are going to cover is

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,840
quite

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
cloud security posture management and

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
threat protection

65
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,840
uh these are all the agendas so we'll be

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,599
discussing cspm in details

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,360
we'll also discuss what is threat

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
protection uh or cloud workload

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,160
protection these two terms

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,239
are quite similar and they refer

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,120
protection only

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,040
we'll also discuss how cspm and cwp tool

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,879
works

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,440
uh then we'll do a demo using microsoft

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,239
defender for cloud tool

76
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
at end we'll wait for q a session and

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,840
we'll take take up the questions

78
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,120
okay so uh what is cloud security

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
portion management so this is a new set

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
of tool id tools which is

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
used to

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
secure your cloud resources

83
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,799
see that is there some security

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,879
misconfiguration in the cloud

85
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,599
and

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,280
it supports automations and there are

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
couple of other added features that

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
we'll be discussing as we move ahead

89
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
so

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
this normally identifies the

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
misconfiguration in the cloud resources

92
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,120
so as you can read here cloud security

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,720
portion management is a market segment

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
for it security tools that are designed

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
to identify misconfiguration issues and

96
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,319
compliance risk in the cloud

97
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,760
it is

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
just

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
okay so it continuously monitor your

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
cloud infrastructure if you go in past

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,159
the traditional way we used to if you

102
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,478
are using ss we used to run a scan by

103
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,358
putting ip hostname even such tool

104
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,918
supports scanning using mac address

105
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,199
okay so

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,040
we cannot see it continuously you are

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
scanning and some changes are done you

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,400
will get

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
the alerts at the real time but when you

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
use tools like cspm

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
you'll get a live alert it's quite near

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
to the real world real time so that is

113
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
the main difference if we compare with

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,759
it traditional assessment

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
another major advantages we have is it

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,199
supports automation so it works on

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
robotic process automation

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,560
and

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,080
the moment

120
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,800
the flaws are reported it can

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
automatically uh fix it

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
again it depends from vendor to vendor

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
few vendors are fully

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
supported a few are not supporting fully

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
automated features we'll discuss that

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,560
also as we move ahead

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
cspm tool work by examining and

128
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,560
comparing cloud environment against a

129
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,880
defined set of best practices and rules

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,479
uh can i minimize this i'm seeing your

131
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
yeah great sorry

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
okay

133
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
okay so cloud security postwar

134
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
management helps to understand the

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
current security process and let us know

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
if there is some room for improvement so

137
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
that we can do the fixes

138
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
so basically we have divided into two

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
person one is continuous assessment

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
another is

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,479
recommendation part so tool will do the

142
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,080
continuous assessment it will let you

143
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
know the score where you stand and

144
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
what is your current situation so

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
normally it gives you some score again

146
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
when you will give demo you'll get to

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
know how score is calculated how tool

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,919
reports it's and how you can fix and

149
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
improve your scores so it will let you

150
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
know

151
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,199
the asset inventory uh warranty

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
assessment regulatory compliance where

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
your compliant or not file file

154
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,960
integrity monitoring and couple of other

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
checks are there in continuous

156
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
assessment part

157
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
once you know where you stand

158
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,560
uh you can

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
do the fixes based on the recommendation

160
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,199
given by cspm tool either you can do the

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
changes or tool itself can automate and

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
do the fixtures for you

163
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,199
so hardening guidelines everything is

164
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,560
provided

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
for example let's say we have not

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,960
implemented mfa so it will flag that mfa

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
is not implemented

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,639
suppose we have a vm

169
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,280
so we have concept like just in time vm

170
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
access

171
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
so so rdp is enabled if you keep a vm up

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,440
with rd enabled for a very long period

173
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,599
of time there will be lots and lots of

174
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
hit happening for a brute force attack

175
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,680
so we have a concept like just time

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,560
access

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
uh the moment your vm is

178
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,080
up rdp is enabled and then it will be

179
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
down and

180
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
nobody will able to do a brute force

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
attack

182
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
we can do white list of an application

183
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
that is called application adaptive

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
application control

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
we have adaptive network hardening that

186
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,840
is nothing but a port binding

187
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
port hardening this kind of things again

188
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
we'll discuss all these topics as we

189
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
move ahead

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
coming to the capabilities of cspm tool

191
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
so

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
be it aws gcp

193
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
microsoft all cloud platforms uh they

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,440
have cspm capabilities

195
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,000
for example aws has aws security hub

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
gcp has security command center

197
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,919
microsoft azure has defender for cloud

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
they are capable of detecting and

199
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,080
limiting cloud misconfiguration

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
maintains security best practices for

201
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
different cloud configuration and

202
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,960
services

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,800
map your current configuration to

204
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,479
security control frameworks or

205
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,240
regulatory standards

206
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
you can also do thread quality

207
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,319
management so these are the bare minimum

208
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
capabilities given by any

209
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
cspm tool

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
security policy is a rule about specific

211
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,280
security conditions that we want to

212
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
control

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,599
you can take example of vmdx should be

214
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
encrypted so if that is part of our

215
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
policy whatever checks we want we can

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,240
put that chip and

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
tool will take care of it

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
so

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
we have built-in default policy for

220
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
example azure as your security benchmark

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,519
okay you can modify the policy based on

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
your requirement so all this tool

223
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
supports your own custom

224
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,000
policy customization

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
apart from that you can also do

226
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,720
regularity compliance and standard

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
checks by adding those checks to a

228
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
policy for example if you want to be a

229
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
gdpr compliant so you can add those

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
checks and tool will let you know

231
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,079
whether you are compliant or not

232
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,480
uh this is a typical example of

233
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
how cspm tool works so this is taken by

234
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
azure

235
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
so here you can see these are the

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
controls

237
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
this is the score

238
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,839
this is your current score and if you do

239
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,040
the fixes

240
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
what percentage your score will go high

241
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
so here if you see here i'll take few

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,080
examples and

243
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
we'll move ahead here it is secure

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,519
management ports our score is quite good

245
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,440
there are minor changes that we need to

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
do uh we can click here drop down will

247
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
come and based on the recommendation we

248
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
can do the changes and increase our

249
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
score

250
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
let's pick this one manage access and

251
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,080
permission

252
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,920
so here our posture is very bad our

253
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
score is zero

254
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
max score is four so again

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,680
we can click here

256
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,160
uh while giving demo will

257
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
cover that part also so whatever

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
recommendations is coming the moment we

259
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,480
do all those fixes our score will go up

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
by plus eight percent

261
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
um

262
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
so same encrypt data in transit here we

263
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
are in very good position

264
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,719
we have

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
so this all thing will cover when we'll

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,839
give demo so i'm moving it

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,160
how cf cspm collects logs so

268
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
there are two way to collect logs uh for

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
some cloud components no agents are

270
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
required most of these agents are these

271
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
these components are managed by cloud

272
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
platform only for example pass services

273
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
data services and network

274
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
for few native

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,839
resources we need agent to get logs for

276
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,279
example if you are using a virtual

277
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,440
machine so

278
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
we'll install agent and adult will pull

279
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,160
all the logs and that log will go to

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
csvm tool for analyzing

281
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,640
so

282
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,079
we need agent for

283
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,640
is kubernetes clusters and on-prem

284
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
servers no agent is required for network

285
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,399
data services and

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,200
past services

287
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
uh till now whatever we discussed uh

288
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,640
that was pacific nature

289
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,079
now we are discussing about threat

290
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
protection which is more active in

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,959
nature

292
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,519
so what is threat protection threat

293
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
protection is often known as

294
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
cloud workload protection

295
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
it protects your cloud

296
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
resources using advance and

297
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
intelligent protections and generate

298
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,560
security alerts in case of attack or

299
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
some malicious activity if you see this

300
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,760
diagram how it works write monitor live

301
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
traffic

302
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,279
collect logs and analyze the data for

303
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,720
threads and

304
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
present the same in a dashboard how it

305
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,600
analyze the data it analyze the data

306
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
based on the threat intelligence

307
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,639
behavior analysis and anomaly detection

308
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,079
once threat is

309
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,480
uh like alert is generated

310
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
you have two options you can send the

311
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
logs to sim tool and let stock

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
handle it that is option one or you can

313
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,279
automate your workflow and define the

314
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
rule that if some kind of alert happens

315
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
take this step so we have both options

316
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
based on the policy organization is

317
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
following uh one can go with that option

318
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
for example let's say there is a denial

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
of service attack happening so you can

320
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,240
automate a workflow with workflow with a

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
rule like uh

322
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
restrict the ip or even shut down a

323
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
system where ddos attack is happening so

324
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,079
based on the rules that are mentioned

325
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,440
there our workflow will work

326
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
and again there is no

327
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,880
human intervention based on the rules

328
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
everything is automated and tool itself

329
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
is taking care of everything

330
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
cspm and cwp tools also helps to

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
streamline the process of meeting

332
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,360
regularity compliance requirement like

333
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,079
pci dsa cis benchmark nist these are the

334
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,639
few names there are couple of more

335
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,200
compliance and regularity like hipaa

336
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
chips

337
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,040
gdpr so it supports all major

338
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,600
compliance what are the cloud resources

339
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,760
so this these are not

340
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,040
the huge list

341
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,959
just to give an example network virtual

342
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
machine web service kubernetes container

343
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
database these are few of the example of

344
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
the cloud resources

345
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,279
one of the popular csm cspm tool and cwp

346
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,839
tool is microsoft defender for cloud so

347
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,880
this tool

348
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,680
take care of cspm as well as cwp

349
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
uh

350
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,199
this is a typical dashboard how it looks

351
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,519
when we'll do a demo this all thing will

352
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,480
be covered in a demo

353
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
uh over to your second link

354
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
thank you suman can you please stop

355
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
sharing so i can see her

356
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,160
perfect

357
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,959
uh can you confirm you can see my screen

358
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
oh yes secondly

359
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
perfect yeah

360
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,320
so hello everyone so this is the

361
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
azure porters we are using the azure

362
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,720
tools for this demo

363
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,760
so we have tool called here

364
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
microsoft defender for cloud so this is

365
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
the cspm and the cwp tools so

366
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
i can see some question in the chat so

367
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
what is so okay cloud security processor

368
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
management and the

369
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,839
cloud

370
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,079
protection other tool

371
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,399
for the cloud security so

372
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,440
i will start from the inventory here so

373
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,079
for this particular demo i i have the 84

374
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,839
resources and these are you can see

375
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
different kind of resources like it's a

376
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
virtual machine sql server keyboard app

377
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,519
service

378
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,959
and so on

379
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,839
so by purpose i have done some kind of

380
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
misconfiguration you can see here some

381
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,680
idiot here so we can see how it works

382
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
so let's just start from the first thing

383
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,760
the secure so someone to talk about like

384
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
this tool give the cspm tool give two

385
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,959
things

386
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,440
one the secure score like what you can

387
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
situation now and next in the

388
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,519
recommendation how to improve that so

389
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
let's go for the secure score first

390
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,000
so in this my environment you can see my

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,880
security strategy at 38 that is not good

392
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,240
at least it should be above 70 or 80.

393
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
and

394
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
and i have different kind of

395
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,120
subscription subscription is like

396
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
sorry

397
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,320
a set of environment so

398
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
i can see few subscription has very bad

399
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
few is like even the below average so

400
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
these are the things

401
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
so now we know like

402
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
our cloud configuration cloud resources

403
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,920
are not up to mark and so there could be

404
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
many reasons so

405
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
so this tool had detected and gave him

406
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,800
the secure score now let's see the

407
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
recommendation thing so how to fix that

408
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,120
so these are the controls so

409
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
these are the control that i was looking

410
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
for and in almost all the control we are

411
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,600
very bad

412
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
so let's take an example so first

413
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,639
recommendation is saying enable the mfa

414
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,600
like earlier we have uh

415
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
if you talk about the security like

416
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,959
before cloud then like if you harden

417
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,800
everything harder network then you are

418
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,880
secured but in the cloud like network is

419
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,199
not like the first security boundary

420
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,360
this is the ident identity because you

421
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,800
are accessing the resources from

422
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
anywhere based on the identity and the

423
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
array thing

424
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
so

425
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
as for this current configuration this

426
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
this two defender for cloud tool has uh

427
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,680
uh find that

428
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,759
i have some misconfiguration here so

429
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,279
let's

430
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,959
so i have the subscription in the

431
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,199
subscription we can see so in this

432
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,799
particular subscription we have three

433
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,359
account and that three account has mafia

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,919
not enabled so we are at a high risk

435
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,839
because if anyone like

436
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,720
got to my password

437
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,679
by any any attack technique then they

438
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,760
can simply log into this azure portal

439
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
and they can do whatever damage they

440
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,240
want to do so

441
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
so this is the one configuration and

442
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039
even it's like giving the

443
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,120
description here and what do how to

444
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,720
immediately so these are the steps so if

445
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
you follow this step it will going to

446
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
fix this issue and almost all are

447
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
unhealthy

448
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
and one are not applicable okay

449
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,360
so this is the first recommendation

450
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
let's talk about the other

451
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,520
recommendations so other is saying

452
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
secure port management yeah so you can

453
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,559
see here we have few virtual machines

454
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
and few virtual machines have like the

455
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
port not securely configured so let's

456
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
see what that's so go there

457
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
and again it's saying the description so

458
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
it's like in the high risk because

459
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,520
due to that misconfiguration

460
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
these are the steps we have to follow

461
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,160
so let's and these are the resources so

462
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
like i have four vm that i have in the

463
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
high risk now only one is in the healthy

464
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
situation

465
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
so let's

466
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,640
have a look for one this vm the network

467
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,280
so now it's we can see we have enabled

468
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,480
rdp

469
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,200
3389 four new to any so it means like

470
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
high it is why should i enable energy

471
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
and it means any anyone can try to log

472
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
in anyone can do the brute force

473
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440
same goes for the second second rule the

474
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
440 is enabled for like any to any so

475
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,919
this is of course the misconfiguration

476
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
thing misconfession so even like any

477
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
cloud engineer like who has not much

478
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
knowledge or maybe they have

479
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
configured this by mistake

480
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
this defender for cloud tool has

481
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
detected that this misconfiguration and

482
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,080
this should be fixed

483
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,439
so let's talk about some other

484
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
other control

485
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
so this is about the tvm so the threat

486
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
probability assessment so as per this

487
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
tool

488
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
i have the seven vms and four vm is

489
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
missing that this

490
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
is and uh

491
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,559
and gravity should be remediated means

492
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,200
no no anyone vm so if you go inside

493
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,520
again this

494
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,160
and and we can see like the all these

495
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
four vms have the issues again let's go

496
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,879
for any in this video

497
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
i know

498
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,120
so

499
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,559
someone also talked about some kind of

500
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,200
like automated fix so like this tool is

501
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
giving us saying like okay so this is

502
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,400
the problem this

503
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
vm has not like tbm installed so simply

504
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
click on i suppose i want to fix on that

505
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,880
pc 0 1 click and fix so if you fix that

506
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
is giving an option so

507
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,360
in the azure uh world like there are

508
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
multiple options so one with like

509
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
defender for the endpoint that the tvm

510
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,520
solution we can install

511
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,240
we

512
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,679
also support the colleagues we also

513
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
support you the third party like other

514
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
rappers even and other things so we have

515
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,280
multiple options it's depend on the

516
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,799
licensing things we don't want to go

517
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,039
licensing things but but these two are

518
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,120
free here so even you can go for the

519
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
college or you can go for the defender

520
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,000
for end point you can see here included

521
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
image and nothing we have don't have to

522
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,320
play extra both have included here

523
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
so once we proceed that so suppose let's

524
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,440
do that

525
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
fix one so what will happen in the

526
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
background that this tbm solution will

527
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
be installed in this pc and they will

528
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,360
they will go to all the scanning inside

529
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
the vms inside the server and they'll

530
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,360
give all the findings and then we have

531
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
to take actions

532
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,559
and these activities we will be like

533
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,559
suppose right now we have like seven vms

534
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
you can see suppose tomorrow i created

535
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,520
one more more vm it became number eight

536
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
so this will be automatically uh scan as

537
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,760
well so this tool like

538
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,480
do the continuous assessment and almost

539
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
all in the real time not real but

540
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,120
near real time and it will flag here

541
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
so these are the like you can see all

542
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,159
these controls are being monitored so

543
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,840
they are the controls and this is from

544
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
the like the sun also talk about the

545
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,159
likes of policy so from where we are

546
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,600
getting all this so all these are

547
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,480
defined in the policy uh so there's like

548
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,960
the default policy and the custom one

549
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,640
and the like regulatory compliance so

550
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,159
it's almost all coming from the uh

551
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,600
default policy

552
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,919
so let's see take some example here like

553
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,919
defender for end point protection so

554
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
this is the antivirus anti-malware

555
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
solution suppose in your organization

556
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,240
you are using like a mac cap or some

557
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
other antivirus you don't want to this

558
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
so what this tool will do

559
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,679
this tool will

560
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,039
find that that

561
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,880
vms has not the

562
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
device installed but we know they are

563
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,320
identifies because they are in mega fee

564
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,080
so what we can do we can also disable

565
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
that so

566
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
for example i don't want to look for

567
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,919
that control

568
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
so you can do all these things so i'm

569
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,520
going to now look how all these things

570
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
are coming and how to modify all this

571
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
configuration

572
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
and if you anyone want we can talk more

573
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,960
about in

574
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
any specific thing if you want any

575
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
control

576
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
or let let's talk about one more control

577
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
for example this one enable encryption

578
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,720
at rest

579
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,280
so it means it's giving for the like the

580
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
vms and sql database so in the case of

581
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,480
vms

582
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
all the vm disks should be encrypted and

583
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,919
that will be recommendation in the sql

584
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,679
and the sql database will be encrypted

585
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
also so let's have a look for the vm

586
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
so for the vm it's saying the virtual

587
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
machine should encrypt all the disk

588
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
including the temp disk cache and the

589
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,200
other other disk as well

590
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,280
and this is the description and this is

591
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,760
the step to remediate so for that you

592
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,320
have to use the encryption instruction

593
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
and all vms are like

594
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
unencrypted let's take example again

595
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,159
here

596
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,960
go to the disk and then go to the

597
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,520
setting yeah

598
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
so we can see here like it's not

599
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,600
encrypted if you want to encrypt then

600
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
you want to keep that os that discard

601
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
both so let's go for the os then we have

602
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,840
so when you do the encryption you have

603
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
to store the key somewhere so for that

604
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
you use the service called keyboard in

605
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,919
the jio so and we have to provide all

606
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,320
this information and after that the key

607
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
will be

608
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
stored in the key vault and the disk

609
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
will be encrypted so again this is the

610
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,200
misconfiguration it's not secure

611
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,080
because

612
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
what's the risk here so this is not

613
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,360
encrypted if anyone got log into the

614
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,600
azure portal and they download this vsd

615
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,440
file and then they can like simply

616
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
attach this psd file to any hypervisor

617
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,760
and they can or maybe hyper v and they

618
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,919
can see the data so it should be

619
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,760
encrypted

620
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
one more thing i want to here discuss we

621
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,919
can see like uh encryption is there with

622
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
the pmk so pm keys are the platform

623
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,159
manager key so

624
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
by default in azure all the disks are

625
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,679
encrypted but encrypted by platform by

626
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,600
microsoft by azure so we don't have

627
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
control over the key so what key they

628
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
are using we don't know so again also

629
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,159
this is not the very good practice so

630
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,000
generally what the

631
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
companies do they use their one key to

632
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,000
encrypt so this is the recommendation

633
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,559
this encryption there of course but not

634
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,080
by by the

635
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,720
customer by the user

636
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
so let's go back to the recommendation

637
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,400
again here so and you can see all these

638
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
configurations so now let's talk how to

639
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,919
like modify all this policy for example

640
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,279
i don't want this i don't want to see

641
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,520
this because you're using mcafee so for

642
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
that so till now we have covered two

643
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
things the security score we are bad and

644
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
how to improve that so these are the

645
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,679
things to improve

646
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
so if you go to the environment setting

647
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,840
and then i will choose any specific

648
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,039
subscription maybe this one

649
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,400
and then go to the security policies

650
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,159
and then you can see i have applied the

651
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,080
default policy that is your security

652
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,799
benchmark we can also add other as well

653
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
there are so many

654
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,520
so what the the what the rules are there

655
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,559
inside this policy

656
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,159
and then go to the next

657
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,360
just give a few seconds to load

658
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,520
come on yeah

659
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
so these are the policies so we are

660
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
looking for like in point protection

661
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,720
selective find internet protection

662
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,360
yeah so this is the rule like endpoint

663
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
endpoint protection should be installed

664
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
on the virtual machines but we don't

665
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
want so simply what we do we come here

666
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
and disable it

667
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,320
and apply so up so after this this tool

668
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,000
is not going to look for the defender

669
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,720
for

670
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,679
sorry

671
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,320
in print protects in the vms so this is

672
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,799
how we control the rules and so we can

673
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
disable enable anything from here that

674
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
from the default one and if you want to

675
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
create your own custom rule then you can

676
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,799
also do using the azure policy so azure

677
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,279
policy is a defense service and that is

678
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,720
for the creating all the policies

679
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
and coming back here

680
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,159
so from where we can like uh

681
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,840
configure the policies

682
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,919
other things also talk about like the

683
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,039
agent

684
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,120
so for that we can go to the auto

685
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,120
provisioning

686
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,120
so we can see here like we we have the

687
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
control for the vm so for the

688
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,039
okay so the name of agent is the log

689
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,960
analytics agent and that collect all the

690
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
logs and for vm we have the control so

691
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,039
if you want to like do the scanning for

692
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,919
the facility in the vms of course enable

693
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,520
that if you don't want to disable that

694
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
so we have the control here but we can't

695
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,200
see here like network

696
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
the sql service or the network or even

697
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
the like web app because they are maybe

698
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,720
being controlled by the azure the

699
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
platform but for this kind of resources

700
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,720
we have control if you want to enable

701
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
enable it if you don't want to don't

702
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,720
enable it

703
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
okay okay again coming back to here the

704
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,960
recommendation

705
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,039
so so how like we are getting this

706
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,600
recommendation we can modify that so i

707
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,679
and once you like fix all this

708
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,600
recommendation your our security score

709
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
will be improved

710
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,840
other things like the regulatory

711
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,200
compliance so there are many regulatory

712
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,120
compliance so i have taken a few here

713
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,880
like azure security benchmark pcidss

714
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,240
so

715
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,640
let it load so we can see here as per

716
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,600
the uh for the pci dss

717
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,399
my

718
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,640
uh cloud resources are very bad position

719
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
almost everything is it nothing is good

720
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
for the azure security benchmark yeah

721
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,399
only two items two controls are the

722
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,159
green otherwise it is

723
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
so how to fix so these are the

724
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,559
recommendation and whenever we fix

725
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,559
almost all these recommendations from

726
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,799
here all ready to become greens then

727
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,120
almost we are having all

728
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
so many greens here as well

729
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
if something else you can configure from

730
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
here so for example let's look for this

731
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,760
one why is saying it so network security

732
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
and then this one

733
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,360
okay so it's saying

734
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,039
subnets should be associated with the

735
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,919
nsg in the network so

736
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,559
you you many of you already know like uh

737
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,360
azure has like v-net net has a subnet

738
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
and subnet has like nsg network security

739
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
group is kind of higher

740
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,080
so i support the best practice all the

741
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,600
subnet must have the some kind of

742
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
firewall rule there what to allow what

743
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,039
to not allow but

744
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,120
this tool has found there is a four

745
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
subnet that has no firewall rules it

746
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
means it's like allowed everything so

747
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,799
it's a big risk

748
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,840
see here

749
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,440
okay so these are the like four subnets

750
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,159
uh okay let's go for this one

751
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,799
so this is the subnet and we can see uh

752
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,559
nsg yeah so no nss necessity has like

753
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,840
applied here

754
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
it means anyone can do anything

755
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,919
so you can see here like what i'm point

756
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,840
i'm trying to make here this tool is

757
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,120
like identifying all the

758
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
misconfiguration

759
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,720
as per the best practice like as per the

760
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
pci as per

761
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,559
your security benchmark so all this

762
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,640
should be fixed but we are green here

763
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,279
but we are not again here so this tool

764
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,600
is like capable of doing all this thing

765
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,080
and one more thing this tool is not only

766
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,840
working for the cloud resources it's

767
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,159
also work for the like on-prem servers

768
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,520
suppose for you we have the on-prem

769
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,240
server then we have to install the agent

770
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,799
manually there and after that they start

771
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,559
collecting log for that on-prem server

772
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,080
and we will get the same features for

773
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,919
that server as well and it's also

774
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,000
support for third party cloud as well so

775
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,279
let's not talk about that but it's also

776
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,600
support

777
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,399
so this is the three things the security

778
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,440
score

779
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,559
regulatory compliance and the

780
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,480
recommendation are like the

781
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,159
security cloud posture management so

782
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,240
it's giving us the visibility so what

783
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
your current situation and what we can

784
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,679
do to improve that

785
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,360
now let's talk about the other thing

786
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,279
other thing like the

787
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,279
threat protection or the cloud workload

788
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
protection

789
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
and for that we have

790
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,520
this one rockler protection

791
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,399
and they have very few advanced features

792
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,039
the tvm just in time access all this

793
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,919
thing

794
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,279
sequel assessment frame all the things

795
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,440
and but before that i want to

796
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,039
uh talk about the security alerts

797
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,320
so uh in the alert uh this tool has

798
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
found some kind of suspicious activities

799
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
and they've alerted us so let's take

800
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,640
example of

801
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,520
this one this alert view the few alert

802
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,120
so there is a one server then the

803
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,039
name is of this server

804
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,360
and this activity happened on that date

805
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,279
and attacker ips so someone from that ip

806
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,760
has tried to log in to this

807
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
server rdp session

808
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
and using these different accounts you

809
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,879
can see like they have tried

810
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,760
it was failed but okay so 30

811
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,320
yeah 35 times they have tried to log

812
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,840
into the server using

813
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,039
all these

814
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,200
different accounts so this the third

815
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,799
protection capability of this tool

816
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,120
detected so someone tried to attack your

817
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
uh

818
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,279
virtual machines and i can uh and you

819
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,760
see the host name that got attacked

820
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,720
so what to do now so to take action

821
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,799
so these are the risks they are saying

822
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,799
so like enforce the use of the strong

823
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,360
password and other things due to other

824
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,159
things

825
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,760
and also one if you want to prevent

826
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
attack do this section you can also like

827
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,200
trigger the workflow that you simply

828
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,840
talk about so suppose we know the like

829
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,440
this is the ip problem we are getting

830
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
attacks what we can do simply simply we

831
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
can like block that ip

832
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,960
so that you can do from here from the uh

833
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
workload so your workflow

834
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
and you can also suspend this alert so

835
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,120
when this is you just suppose for

836
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,480
example you are doing some kind of

837
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,840
testing

838
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,519
so you know like this attack is doing by

839
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,039
us then you can simply suppress that a

840
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,480
lot so these are the actions you can

841
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
take so this is the third protection

842
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,919
so this tool is like collecting already

843
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
collecting all the logs um

844
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,320
traffic from all the cloud resources and

845
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,039
after that they analyze that and give

846
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
the alerts let's take one more example

847
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,519
uh just first one

848
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,080
so i have the sql

849
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
service here

850
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,480
yeah so we have the sql database

851
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,799
and again someone has

852
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,720
login to this

853
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,799
database using this ip and it is the

854
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,960
host name of this

855
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,080
computer these are the usual account and

856
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,879
these are the things

857
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,480
let's take another example

858
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,720
client yes create attack executions

859
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,600
let's take this one

860
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,159
again we can see we have the like other

861
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,120
virtual machines that again the attacker

862
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
from this ip has tried to

863
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,080
login in the different account and have

864
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,440
it

865
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,799
so this is the third protection

866
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,279
and there is also one other this one's

867
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,919
interesting one

868
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,320
so this is the

869
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,679
uh adaptive application control policy

870
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,000
so what this will do this particular

871
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
feature so

872
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,320
this fourth feature will like white list

873
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
all the applications or services that

874
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
are running in the particular vms

875
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
so suppose we have

876
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,159
do some kind of white listing we want

877
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,320
only one to run all this application not

878
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
nothing apart from that so if some

879
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
changes happen that will detect is

880
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,399
detected like this changes happen this

881
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,679
this computer and this is the risk so so

882
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,120
what we will do we will go there and

883
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,600
review if this change is done by ourself

884
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,279
or by someone else and we can check the

885
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,200
actions so this is the third protection

886
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,559
so we can see like

887
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,840
our all the resources are being

888
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,440
protected and if anything music happens

889
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,879
they are uh giving the triggers

890
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,639
so this is the third protection and

891
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,599
now go for the

892
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,119
here

893
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,679
workload protection

894
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,760
so i want to

895
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,440
talk about few item here

896
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,679
so which one

897
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,359
let's talk about theme

898
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,480
okay

899
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,320
so what is same so theme is like the

900
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
file integrity monitoring

901
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,159
that will detect all the changes in your

902
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,760
vm so this is the one of the requirement

903
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
of pci dss so like

904
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,960
like if you are the financial

905
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
organization

906
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,239
then you must comply with the pm it

907
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,719
means if anything happen your your

908
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,000
servers like the file changes restricted

909
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
changes or service changes it must be

910
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
notified so

911
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,839
i think

912
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,839
sorry i don't i don't have any vm here

913
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,440
okay let's go for this i have one server

914
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,760
here

915
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,400
okay

916
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,520
so this is the server uh dmo vm and we

917
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
can see

918
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,160
in this particular vms the this service

919
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,680
has enabled and we are seeing seeing 25

920
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
changes has happened so what are the

921
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,960
changes here

922
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440
so if you click on this so some restrict

923
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,400
changes happened in this vm so

924
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,960
before value this one after value this

925
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
one so

926
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
all this value has deleted so we have to

927
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,359
go and investigate that

928
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
okay and we can one more thing you can

929
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,680
do simply go to the vm

930
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
and now log analytics will trigger and

931
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,160
it will give also all the changes so

932
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
what changes are happening so like some

933
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,320
restrict are removed added by whom we

934
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,680
can go inside and you can look for

935
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,720
everything

936
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,759
so this is a theme

937
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,920
so like that

938
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
you can also enable some other advanced

939
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,760
feature so i think we're not going to

940
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,920
cover all the things but at least we are

941
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,800
giving the idea how these tools work so

942
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,119
this tool again coming back to our

943
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,079
initial

944
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,160
topic it's give the visibility of your

945
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,800
security postures and it also protect

946
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,720
you

947
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,000
so what's time now

948
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,599
okay

949
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,440
oh yeah one more thing so about the

950
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,920
workload protection start your workflow

951
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,800
so for example uh something happened

952
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,760
and we want to automate that

953
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,720
scenario so we come here

954
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,240
and i have one workflow defined here

955
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,359
and that is for the like the block

956
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,000
yeah the sequel

957
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,720
brute force for example uh

958
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,280
someone is trying to brute force our sql

959
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,320
server

960
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,440
and what we want if

961
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,560
someone

962
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,960
is trying to the boot first then just

963
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,760
uh

964
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,480
find that ip address and block that ip

965
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,440
address

966
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
so and that can be do automatically so

967
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,599
we have done here so this is workflow

968
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,359
and and in the background of the

969
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,119
workflow the logic app works so again

970
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,200
the azure logic application the kind of

971
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,839
service that do the workflow automation

972
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,839
so i want to

973
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,560
show that as well so go to the logic app

974
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,240
and it was yes you called boot first

975
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,799
blocking

976
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
it

977
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,200
so like it has like all the

978
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
all the process and the workflow so what

979
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,640
we are doing we are if we get any alert

980
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,480
on the security center

981
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
okay so older name is the security

982
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
center the new navy defender for cloud

983
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,720
so here is the old name so if any we get

984
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,640
any alert then

985
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,800
we find the ipad desktop attacker so it

986
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,480
will find the ip address of attacker and

987
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,760
then what we'll do

988
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,480
that put that ip in the block list for

989
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,200
the nsg the firewall rules

990
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,359
and so we will all the steps are here

991
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,760
and and then at the last we'll do other

992
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
things and then we can and the new rule

993
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,680
will be created

994
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,880
so how the this workflow happened and

995
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,320
the attacker app will be blocked

996
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
automatically we don't have to take any

997
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,599
actions

998
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,560
so this is the workflow

999
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,040
automation in the case of

1000
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,119
sorry in the case of attack so you can

1001
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,839
also configure that

1002
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,200
there are few more items

1003
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,119
they want to cover so let's go to again

1004
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,119
environment setting go to the

1005
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,599
subscription

1006
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,240
so defender for cloud has like two plan

1007
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
one is the like free so you can say

1008
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,400
enhance feature off and the defender for

1009
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
cloud on so this one is free but this

1010
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
has only two capabilities

1011
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,280
secure escort and the continuous

1012
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,480
assessment

1013
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,240
like still you are

1014
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,800
getting the visibility and the

1015
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
recommendation

1016
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
uh

1017
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,760
for this one but for the paid one we are

1018
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,079
getting so many advanced features and

1019
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,079
but for that we have to pay here so

1020
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,480
there are some kind of like for for the

1021
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,520
vm

1022
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,560
for servers so per server 15 usd per

1023
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
month so i have a four unit server that

1024
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,280
means i have to pay 100 usd per month

1025
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,079
and and and so on

1026
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,240
so still if you are not want to pay for

1027
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,400
this service if simply you can

1028
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,000
enable that one you still you are

1029
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,520
getting the visibility and the secure

1030
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,280
scores

1031
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,040
and we talk about auto provisioning

1032
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,359
already then

1033
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,520
we can also notify so whenever the

1034
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,359
alerts come here you can notify like

1035
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,960
send this alert to this particular email

1036
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
address or somewhere

1037
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,119
and then the integration

1038
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,160
you can also send the

1039
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,400
alert or the recommendation to the other

1040
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,319
tools like the defender for endpoint so

1041
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,040
on

1042
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,480
we'll talk about that

1043
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,040
we also talk about the security policies

1044
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,279
okay

1045
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
so i think we have cover pretty much so

1046
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
maybe we are happy to take the questions

1047
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,200
all right

1048
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,079
done with the demo right

1049
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,560
yeah yeah okay thank you so much

1050
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,640
suckerdeep and suman for this amazing

1051
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,960
informative session and i am sure that

1052
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,680
our participants uh must have found some

1053
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,560
knowledgeable inputs so guys if you have

1054
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,200
any questions you can drop it in the

1055
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,839
chat box

1056
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,880
yeah so this is one question of what is

1057
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,839
cwp so cwp is like a cloud docker

1058
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,800
protection so it's like a set of tool

1059
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,280
the concept that include in the tool

1060
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
that will protect you your all the cloud

1061
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,359
workload as you can see like

1062
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,200
when someone is trying to attack my vms

1063
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,920
i got the alert so that is the cwp and

1064
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,680
the cloud security process management is

1065
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,119
like it's the tool that you give the

1066
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,119
visibility so you can see here

1067
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
the tool was giving the secure score

1068
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,960
that was 38 percent and it also was

1069
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,480
giving the recommendation so these are

1070
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
the controls has misconfigured and if

1071
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,560
you configure that well you will get the

1072
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,880
secure score increase so this is the

1073
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,960
tool and the defender for cloud is the

1074
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,040
tool that includes this both concept so

1075
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,240
you can see these are the two concepts

1076
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,560
and that comes under the many cloud

1077
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,240
provider tools

1078
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,839
recording okay announcement

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,720
okay how would the security rating done

1080
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
and are the security policy and

1081
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,880
benchmark taken from the

1082
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,040
framework and standard yeah so we

1083
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,720
already talked about there are so many

1084
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,560
different type of security policies one

1085
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,480
is like the default policy that every

1086
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,319
cloud provider given by default for

1087
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,079
example in the case of azure the

1088
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,000
geosecurity benchmark they have their

1089
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,760
own security benchmark

1090
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
that is very similar to cs benchmark

1091
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,160
that is default one if you want of

1092
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,200
course you can also use the pci dss ios

1093
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,240
one other yes

1094
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,560
and

1095
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,710
[Music]

1096
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,040
uh i have a question uh which are the

1097
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,079
best automated

1098
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,720
csmp tools available at the moment

1099
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
okay yeah so this is a very tough

1100
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
question because every cloud provider

1101
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
say we are the best like in your stage

1102
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,040
we are the best aws you are the best and

1103
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,359
this and the other so what i can say is

1104
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,760
suppose you have the your resource in

1105
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,800
the azure then go for the azure tool if

1106
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,119
you have it source in the like aws go

1107
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,680
for the aws because they support native

1108
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
so even like microsoft azure state we

1109
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,079
support the azure resources as well as

1110
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,560
third party cloud resources like aws and

1111
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,040
gcp but of course i think

1112
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,280
for the aws resources the workload aws

1113
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,400
tool will be the best

1114
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,599
okay

1115
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,400
uh

1116
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,640
we also have a question from paige what

1117
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,760
is the c i s benchmark is it necessary

1118
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,599
to learn

1119
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,640
someone can you cover that

1120
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,000
uh it's a standard so you don't have to

1121
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,599
like

1122
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,720
you get to know whether you are

1123
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,560
compliant as per she has benchmark or

1124
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,079
not

1125
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,880
yeah so cis is benchmarking like set of

1126
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,160
extender

1127
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,319
for the security so it's defined a set

1128
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,160
of rules like this should be done that

1129
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,520
should not be done

1130
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,240
and then i don't think uh it's it's

1131
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,000
covered more of a configuration thing

1132
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,720
and maybe yeah since almost a decade

1133
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,680
more than decade i believe yeah i i even

1134
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,319
almost all tools are like no this

1135
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,400
benchmark and they all already they have

1136
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,280
their depository and and if you enable

1137
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,000
that bcs benchmark the tool will

1138
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,240
compare your current configuration with

1139
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,000
the cs benchmark configuration it will

1140
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,440
give you the

1141
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
like information or finding that you are

1142
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,640
not comp compliance in the css benchmark

1143
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,960
and how it's necessary to learn i think

1144
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,359
no if you are using the tool then tool

1145
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,680
will do all work for you but if you are

1146
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,119
auditor then of course you should know

1147
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,040
all this thing

1148
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,839
okay uh we have another question from

1149
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,119
jaimandi

1150
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,599
uh how to go for integration when we

1151
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,119
have resources in aws and azure uh

1152
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,240
anything on app security front also we

1153
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
saw only about the infrastructure

1154
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,040
okay yeah perfect

1155
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,319
yeah so for the aw uh so adjective just

1156
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,200
told

1157
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,760
all the tools support from a multi-cloud

1158
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,839
so in the case of azure let's go here

1159
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,839
okay

1160
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
so you can see here and this tool also

1161
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,040
support the azure also aws in the gcp so

1162
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,440
for the azure i have the pi for the aws

1163
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,760
and this if you don't have anything so

1164
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
it's you can also connect

1165
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,560
this tool to the aws and gcp resources

1166
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,960
using the api and it will get all these

1167
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
things in some information same finding

1168
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,720
for that what's the question again

1169
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,560
yeah yeah so you can integrate easily

1170
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,880
with the with the other cloud app

1171
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
provider as well

1172
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
and app change yeah so let me cover few

1173
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,359
things for the app as well so it's of

1174
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,680
course also support the app security but

1175
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,720
f security is not trump of the code

1176
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,520
like as a platform level for example you

1177
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,800
are using the

1178
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,520
what is your app service or the or the

1179
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
functions then of course that will give

1180
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,760
all the recommendation but if you want

1181
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,160
to do the abstract at the

1182
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,920
code level then of course we have to use

1183
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
some kind of different tool and that

1184
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,480
mainly using the ci cd pipelines like we

1185
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
do all the kind of scanning there or

1186
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,880
maybe someone can talk more about that

1187
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,319
security but let me first show how that

1188
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,680
we can do

1189
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
for everything here

1190
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,280
so if you go to recommendations

1191
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,520
and there must be something for app as

1192
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,520
well

1193
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,040
therefore app is almost everything cover

1194
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,920
yeah we can see here so for this though

1195
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,880
we have the web app 15 web app and they

1196
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,839
find that ftp should be required

1197
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,119
so ftps so these are the

1198
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,720
opportunities they find in all these

1199
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,200
websites web apps but still we are

1200
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
talking about the the

1201
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,760
web app but on the platform

1202
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,880
level not at the code

1203
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,200
goes to others

1204
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,520
level things

1205
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,520
or maybe you can unmute yourself and you

1206
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,119
can talk

1207
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,319
so

1208
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,400
what i believe for app is better to go

1209
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,160
with traditional dashed and slashed

1210
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,558
approach

1211
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,040
controlling app security through cspm

1212
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,480
you you won't be getting that kind of

1213
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,319
control yeah because because this tool

1214
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,280
is for the like the cloud

1215
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,440
visibility like visibility and resources

1216
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,119
whatever resource you have in the cloud

1217
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,599
it could be vm it could be network uh

1218
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,400
web apps database for that things but if

1219
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,240
you are talking about the code level

1220
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,319
then of course if you're using the ci cd

1221
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,160
pipelines to deploy the code again then

1222
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,319
there's so many tools you can use there

1223
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,640
like solar winds or some size water tool

1224
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,800
name

1225
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,839
for the

1226
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,119
scanning

1227
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,000
oops

1228
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,400
white source voltage there yeah yeah

1229
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,520
yeah that you can use

1230
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,280
i hope answered your question

1231
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,599
yeah so i think

1232
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,079
those were all the questions that we had

1233
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,280
uh thank you so much once again and

1234
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,440
thank you all for your participation in

1235
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,440
today's webinar session thank you

1236
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,800
everyone thank you thank you
