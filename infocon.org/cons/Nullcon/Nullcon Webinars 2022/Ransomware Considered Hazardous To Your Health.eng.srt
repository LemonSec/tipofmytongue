i've long wanted to attend to norcon and

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440

that opportunity yet so this is a this

88

taking the time to listen to me

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,040
so um when when suctioner team contacted

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
me about um

94
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,080
about doing this presentation it it so

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
happened that um

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,439
at that time there was this kind of

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,280
quite remarkable advisory issued by um

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
by cesar

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
uh the fbi and the u.s uh british

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
ncsa and australian uh cyber security

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,238
authorities that spoke about this um

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,680
increased global threat of ransomway um

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
and it was extraordinary mostly just in

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
the sense that it was this collaborative

105
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
effort by by governments worldwide

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
and

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,639
it uh it

108
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
it caught my attention

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,479
uh because you know because of its

110
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,320
profile but i was also very interested

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,560
to see what they had to say you know

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
what were they basing their uh their

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,600
assessment um because of course

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,199
ransomware is something that myself and

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,360
my team have been studying

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
very intensively for several years now

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
and it's curious to me to see whether

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,000
you know our assessment and their

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
assessment combined and so with the

120
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
invitation to speak at melbourne i

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
thought it might be an opportunity to

122
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
use this

123
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
advisory

124
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,840
kind of as a framework for

125
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,639
for examining our own findings and data

126
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
and assumptions about the ransomware

127
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
about the ransomware threat so i come to

128
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
you today not with any particular point

129
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
in mind i don't have a you know an

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
argument to make or a story to sell

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
or something to

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
convince you of i really just have a set

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,400
of observations that are oriented around

134
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,280
this um this

135
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
extraordinary advisory

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
um and i'm going to base my observations

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,720
on a set of data that that we have now i

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
want to be clear that i believe that

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
when cesar the fbi ncse and australian

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,440
cyber security authorities say something

141
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
that they're saying it with um

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
uh with good reason

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,479
they've got data they've got analysts

144
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
they've got intelligence that we will

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
probably never have

146
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
um and so when i present our data i'm

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,360
not presenting it as uh you know

148
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,759
superior to to theirs um really just as

149
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,479
a counterpoint to see um

150
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,560
you know as i said what to what extent

151
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
our perspectives agree or disagree with

152
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
theirs

153
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,919
and the first the first data set

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,880
we have is from the you know so-called

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
double extortion league sites my i saw

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
my colleague diana was able to join us

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
this morning hi diana

158
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
um and she runs a project in which we

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
try and identify league sites like the

160
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,039
conti one uh on the open web of the dark

161
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
web where the

162
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,919
the sort of

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
uh common

164
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
almost common form of uh ransomware's

165
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
played out this so-called double

166
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
extortion attacks

167
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
um

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,479
and we have been analyzing those sites

169
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,759
for about

170
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,960
two years

171
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
um sorry that's not the one i wanted to

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
show you i'll show you some data on it

173
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
in a moment uh but we have about we have

174
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
over 4 000

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
records

176
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
enriched records of the victims of these

177
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,880
actors which we can use to

178
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,720
give us some insight into how ransomware

179
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
works

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,479
the next thing we have of course as of

181
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,759
just a week ago is the the now infamous

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,199
conti leaked

183
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,000
so from this uh this almost geopolitical

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
dispute that emerged within the county

185
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,919
organization considering one of the big

186
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
ransomware groups

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
um there was a big dump of the internal

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
chats and and messages

189
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
spanning about a two year

190
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
well yeah the one and a half year period

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
and as you can see from the screenshot

192
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,039
dinah and the team have collected about

193
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,759
200 000 messages

194
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
across in excess of 160 people uh who

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
make up this group and although we're

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
still very early in our examination of

197
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
this data it does also provide us a lot

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,400
of really interesting insights

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
in the um the next

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
data set that that we have is um

201
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,639
is really a model that that we create

202
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,599
called the um

203
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
our state of the threat model and the

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
state of the threat model

205
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
argues that

206
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
the threats that we face on any given

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
day

208
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,440
it's the picture that you see on the

209
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
right are really a function of several

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
systemic factors that collude

211
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,800
and and coincide to to create an

212
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
emergent

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
reality

214
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
and we track and record

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,839
track organize and record those um those

216
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,839
systemic factors on a graph

217
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,599
a screenshot of which you can see here i

218
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
know it's very difficult to make sense

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
of this graph

220
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
in this picture but that's not the goal

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,200
the goal is just let you know that we

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
have a graph like this in which we

223
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,480
record all the elements of the landscape

224
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
and try and reflect how they interact to

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
create the realities that we see today

226
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
and i'm going to be referencing this

227
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
data set also

228
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,120
so coming back to the

229
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,959
to the data leaks uh the data set that i

230
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,240
started with so i should have shown you

231
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
the slide a bit earlier

232
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
but just to give you a sense of it so

233
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
you'll see that

234
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
we track somewhere between

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,600
you know

236
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
high 20s and low 30s on average unique

237
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
actors over time in 2021 we observed 53

238
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
unique actors so far in 2022 that's 21

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
unique so those are ransomware groups

240
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
that are publicly releasing their

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
victims or publishing their victims on

242
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
online

243
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
and then on the right you can sort of

244
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
see a breakdown of who those actors are

245
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
so when it comes to conti for example

246
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
we've recorded 654

247
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
publicly disclosed victims and i want to

248
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,360
be clear here this data set is not

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,880
talking about attacks it's not

250
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,279
reflecting what these ransomware crews

251
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,000
are trying to do who they're hitting

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
uh you know how hard they try these are

253
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,079
the recorded victims this is the end

254
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,720
statements the winds for these

255
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,640
for these gangs and so it's a it's a

256
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
useful data set

257
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
um mostly just because it's so it's so

258
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
simple and sort of self-explanatory in

259
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,519
its uh in its nature

260
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,399
all right

261
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,240
so what i'm going to oh sorry and then

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
we have one last data set which is um

263
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
our cyber sock

264
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
cybersock data so we we offer a managed

265
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,760
threat detection service

266
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,959
for

267
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,360
you know dozens of clients

268
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,519
across the globe but mostly oriented

269
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,720
around europe

270
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
and

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
in a year last year we collected about

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
94 000 incidents that were investigated

273
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
by our analysts

274
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
of which about 34 000 turned out to be

275
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
confirmed security incidents

276
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
and those 34 000

277
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,519
uh incidents also give us some insight

278
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,640
into what's happening in the threat

279
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,600
landscape and i'm going to be

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,839
referencing that data also

281
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,800
okay

282
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
so but that's uh that's the background

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
that's how i'm going to approach it so

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,959
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

285
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,320
take snippets from this report

286
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,399
and then share my perspective on that

287
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,959
snippet and the first snippet comes

288
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,560
from early on in the report right up in

289
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
the beginning it's this highlighted part

290
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
on left here

291
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,880
and there you can see the countries

292
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
united states australia united kingdom

293
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
and then they say

294
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,360
they observed an increase

295
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
firstly

296
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
sophisticated high impact

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
critical infrastructure and globally and

298
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,720
i'm going to sort of check all of those

299
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
adjectives

300
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,880
so let's start by looking at increase

301
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,519
this is our data from the from the data

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,040
leak site

303
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
and i added a trendline and you can see

304
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
that i think it's fair to say that it is

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
increasing

306
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
in fact

307
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
that's the period

308
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,839
reflected in the csa report so

309
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,120
2021 um and you can see that it's a

310
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
steady increase across the year in the

311
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,160
month on month volumes of these attacks

312
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
that diana team

313
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,680
observe and record

314
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,680
if we compare 2021 with 2020 that's

315
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
about a 53

316
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,800
increase in the volume of these

317
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,599
of these attacks

318
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,920
so the problem is definitely growing

319
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
and i'll comment a little bit later on

320
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,839
on why i think that that may be the case

321
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
then i want to comment on the question

322
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
of whether it's global and this is also

323
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,000
um

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,519
this is also something we can look at

325
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,279
very nicely through the data that we

326
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,000
have i will offer you two perspectives

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
um in fact i'm going to offer you

328
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
several perspectives on this so on the

329
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
left hand side we see a breakdown of

330
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
victims per country so again these are

331
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
end state victims not talking about who

332
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
they're attacking i'm talking about who

333
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
they're compromising

334
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,519
um

335
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,519
and the two things i want you to note is

336
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,480
that there are several dozens of

337
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
countries listed in this victims list so

338
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
so businesses in every country are being

339
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,399
hit

340
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,200
but

341
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,240
there is a very strong orientation on

342
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,839
the left-hand side

343
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
towards what i would call the major

344
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
english-speaking

345
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,120
economies so the usa and canada is in

346
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
there also

347
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,959
and then after that the the major

348
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
european economies so yes it's global

349
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,800
but it's also very concentrated

350
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
in terms of ectomology

351
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,760
um and then on the right-hand side graph

352
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
what we see is a count as sort of a

353
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,360
distribution

354
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,480
of the number of countries hit by each

355
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
of the actors

356
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
and basically what i'm trying to show

357
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
here is that

358
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,000
on the whole actors are hitting several

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,399
different countries so you see lock but

360
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
in excess of 60 different countries on

361
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
the victim's list rival 40

362
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,360
uh club where's conti i don't see

363
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
confidence anyway i didn't list the um

364
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
i didn't explicitly list the the actors

365
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,760
in the bottom the thing i wanted to show

366
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
you was the shape of this curve so on

367
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
the right hand side down towards the

368
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,560
bottom you do see some actors that have

369
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,040
only hit one or two victims but on the

370
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,320
whole in

371
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
different victim countries but on the

372
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,399
whole

373
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
uh these guys are hitting

374
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
diverse countries all over the uh all

375
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
over the globe and we don't see any

376
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,399
indication

377
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,839
that there is kind of strong

378
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,560
specialization in other words

379
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
the u.s is being hit a lot

380
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,839
but other countries are also being hit

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
by the different groups i'll come back

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
to that in a sec

383
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,199
so if we then dive into this question of

384
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,600
who's being hit uh which countries are

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,959
being hit

386
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,839
what we can do is to

387
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,600
correlate these leak volumes per country

388
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,760
with the assessed

389
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,839
you know gdp national gdp for those

390
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,959
economies and what you'll see is that as

391
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,360
a general observation

392
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
taking the us canada france germany

393
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,160
britain

394
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
even italy as a

395
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,560
you know as a benchmark that the number

396
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,160
of victims that we see in those

397
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,399
countries is a function or correlates

398
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,120
with at least the number the size of the

399
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
economy in those in those countries

400
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,160
so

401
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
our hypothesis is that when you look at

402
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
that distribution that shows a strong

403
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
weighting towards the west that's simply

404
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,839
because there are more online businesses

405
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,120
in those

406
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,360
in those countries not because of any

407
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,240
kind of deliberate um choices that the

408
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,560
attackers are making

409
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
so think a little bit a little bit about

410
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,800
uh

411
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
you know um

412
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
you know you throw a you throw a paw boy

413
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
at a fan and it splatters the paw paw

414
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,440
and hits the wall it's going to hit the

415
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
wall

416
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
uh you know more or less

417
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
evenly and if your part of the wall is

418
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,920
bigger like the use economy is bigger

419
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,959
they're obviously going to get more

420
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,000
popcorn

421
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
but analogy hops

422
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
there are however some some obvious

423
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,279
exceptions

424
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,279
so we could say for example on the

425
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,600
bottom right that russia is

426
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
under-represented

427
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
as a

428
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,199
in terms of the number of victims given

429
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
the size of their economy you would

430
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,639
think that they're sort of up there with

431
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,280
italy or at least with

432
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,680
[Music]

433
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,920
austria but they're not and i think we

434
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
know that that's because um

435
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
many of these threat actors operate out

436
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,639
of the cis countries

437
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
um and have a sort of implicit or

438
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
explicit policy of not targeting

439
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
businesses in their

440
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,320
backyard

441
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
but then

442
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
um left of russia you have india

443
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
china japan

444
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
and

445
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,079
okay let's forget switzerland for now

446
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,959
let's go

447
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,240
india japan and china where you would

448
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
also think that the um

449
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
the number of victims

450
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,120
seems disproportionate

451
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
given the size of the economy and and

452
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,919
japan and china i think are the great

453
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,679
examples of that and they've got

454
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,160
enormous economies that hardly feature

455
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,079
at all in terms of our list of victims

456
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
and that's an interesting point that i

457
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,919
want to elaborate on in a minute

458
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
but before i elaborate on it i want to

459
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,679
point out some other data that diana and

460
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,439
her team

461
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,559
collected so again looking at the number

462
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,799
of victims per country

463
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,480
and examining the growth between 2021

464
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,720
and 2022

465
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
what we see is that there is very strong

466
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,280
growth in

467
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
across all the all the

468
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
geographies

469
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,080
so 30 percent in the u.s 16 in canada 25

470
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
percent earn your increase in um

471
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,520
in the uk but remember what i said on

472
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,480
average or in total it was a 53 increase

473
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
between 21 and 22.

474
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,600
and the the difference between this 30

475
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,640
on the left and the um

476
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
and the 50

477
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
total

478
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
uh is in the enormous growth that we saw

479
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
in other countries 76

480
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
collectively for the for the eu 34 in

481
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
brazil 125

482
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
in japan 86 in india and 360

483
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
in china

484
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
and so on the right if you look at the

485
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
impact that this growth has on their on

486
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
the proportion of those countries

487
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
amongst our victims you'll see that

488
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,360
proportionately the

489
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
us has decreased by eight percent

490
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
while europe has increased by

491
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,679
three percent and so what we're saying

492
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,799
is that

493
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
this is a global problem

494
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,120
it does tend to focus around the bigger

495
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,679
english-speaking economies but it's

496
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,440
shifting

497
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,760
it's shifting towards bigger

498
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
non-english speaking economies like

499
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
europe india

500
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
china and japan

501
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
and the question is well why would that

502
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,600
would that be

503
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,880
to answer that question we can look into

504
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,640
the actual chats of the of the conti

505
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
group and i've i've just given you a

506
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
snapshot of the organizational structure

507
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
of this quantity group to give you some

508
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
some context

509
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,399
so in a cluster that deal with um

510
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
that deal with

511
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,880
recon and negotiations you see those two

512
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
little network things on the one right

513
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,880
there is a guy or a girl called skippy

514
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
and she reports into quite a big shot

515
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,039
called called mango and this is a

516
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
conversational part of a conversation

517
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,280
between skippy and mango skippy is

518
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,679
talking to mango about a case that she's

519
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,280
working on meaning she's negotiating

520
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,280
with a victim for a ransom um and she

521
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,679
says she needs some some advice

522
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,640
um

523
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
and she wants to know

524
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
what can we

525
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,120
um what

526
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,840
what

527
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,480
what should we extort them for

528
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,039
what can be extorted from them says

529
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
and then she goes on to say

530
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
it's like some kind of

531
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
city

532
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,480
i don't really understand and this

533
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,559
totally i understand is a word that says

534
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
in russian like or something she says

535
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
it's some kind of city or something i

536
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,200
don't really understand

537
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,880
and they they want to offer only 20 000

538
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,400
as ransom

539
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,960
and what this shows us is that the

540
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,559
and this is a very important point the

541
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
actual crime that we're examining here

542
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
when those victims end up on the league

543
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,600
sites is not a crime of hacking it's a

544
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,360
crime of extortion

545
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
which means that a negotiation has to

546
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
take place in which the criminal

547
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,559
understands or tries to understand the

548
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,520
value of what they've hacked and then

549
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
effectively sell it back to the to the

550
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
victim i hope that makes sense

551
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
and so they see this report that that

552
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
mango

553
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,159
refers to they actually have a group of

554
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
people that go and examine they call

555
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,400
they call it during reikwan they go and

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
examine

557
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
the victim it's already the victim

558
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,120
they've already compromised them but if

559
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
they're going to examine them from a

560
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,480
business point of view to understand

561
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,120
what can be extorted from them

562
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,799
and my point is this that where

563
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,240
where these non-english speaking russian

564
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
based actors

565
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,360
can't understand the businesses that

566
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,600
they've compromised they

567
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
they find it very hard to extort a

568
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,720
ransom

569
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
and so the

570
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,280
the theory that we have is that the

571
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,720
barrier

572
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,600
for these actors to um

573
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,679
to compromising

574
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,000
businesses outside the english-speaking

575
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,159
west is cultural they struggle with the

576
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,440
language they struggle to read the

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
business stocks they they they don't

578
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,039
have the tools that they would

579
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,280
ordinarily have to

580
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
um

581
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
to to determine what a business is worth

582
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
you know what their net worth is what

583
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
they turn who the executives are

584
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,919
etcetera

585
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,240
um and and that indicates a bit before

586
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,600
preference so it feels like my door has

587
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
been banged down on the right

588
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,720
that indicates a preference for

589
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,440
businesses in economies that they can

590
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
understand

591
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,520
but

592
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,799
as

593
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,120
those economies get almost saturated

594
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,559
with victims and as we see pressure from

595
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,480
governments in the west

596
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,640
against these actors we believe what

597
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
we're seeing is a move towards

598
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,600
target markets that have previously been

599
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,240
more difficult to penetrate because of

600
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
this cultural impediment i hope that

601
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,159
makes some sense

602
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,280
so yes the problem is global but

603
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
it's changing shape so it's shifting

604
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
from the english-speaking big economies

605
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,559
to the non-english speaking big

606
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,840
economies and that's going to include

607
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,919
places like india where you are and

608
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,559
south africa where i am as well as china

609
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,600
and japan

610
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,799
and the um the the the barrier to entry

611
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,520
we believe for this is probably

612
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,960
something to do with language and

613
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
culture

614
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,320
rather than the sophistication of the

615
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,080
technology or security controls in those

616
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
environments

617
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,280
okay

618
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
then it talks about the report talks

619
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,679
about critical infrastructure

620
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
organizations globally

621
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
and i've shown on the left from the

622
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,280
cesar page what they consider to be

623
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
critical infrastructure and it makes it

624
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
kind of hard because they have

625
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,600
almost

626
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,799
all the

627
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
sectors have got

628
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
something critical in them

629
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,919
um so i can't really say you know

630
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,039
whether critical infrastructure

631
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,240
is being affected more or less

632
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
what i can say from the graph on the

633
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
right which again shows victimology is

634
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,440
that we see an overwhelming

635
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,679
bent towards victims in the

636
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
manufacturing sector manufacturing this

637
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,880
is as defined by naics standards so it's

638
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
a broad category

639
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
and it'll be sort of manufacturing and

640
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,400
associated

641
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,159
businesses and i guess

642
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
you know that's going to correlate with

643
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
a number of the sectors listed as

644
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
critical in the cisa reports including

645
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,918
things like critical manufacturing

646
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,640
and that's then followed by

647
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
professional scientific services and it

648
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
kind of goes down from their finance and

649
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,960
insurance it's actually not particularly

650
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
high up utilities you'll see or right

651
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
down at the bottom there we almost see

652
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,559
no victims in that space in terms of

653
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,240
the victimology

654
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
agriculture even further down

655
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
um so it doesn't

656
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,679
seem to me that

657
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
there is the there is a bent towards um

658
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
manufacturing but we have some more data

659
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,880
that we can examine

660
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,760
and again i'm using the same trick here

661
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,159
as we use to examine the

662
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,559
geography the nationality of the victims

663
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,039
which is to correlate with industry

664
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,720
science

665
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,120
and when we do that

666
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,240
the volume of victims in

667
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,960
some industries becomes

668
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
obvious so we can see professional

669
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
scientific and technical services which

670
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,480
is

671
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,919
you know one of the highest groups of

672
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
victims it's also one of the biggest

673
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,200
industries so that kind of correlation

674
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
makes sense

675
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
and i would say from there kind of down

676
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,840
to you know educational services the

677
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,279
correlation still makes sense

678
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,840
where there's an anomaly again is in

679
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
manufacturing

680
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,279
where you can see that manufacturing

681
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,120
represents a disproportional

682
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
percentage i think it's something like

683
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
23 of all our victims

684
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,080
uh fall into this category it is

685
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,360
actually relatively speaking a small

686
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,799
business sector

687
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,320
so that does certainly seem to be a kind

688
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,279
of stand-out feature

689
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,559
and again i think

690
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,120
we can draw some uh observations and

691
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,520
this is a little bit sort of tangential

692
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
um but we can draw some uh

693
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
observations by looking at the checks

694
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
between some of these players and in

695
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,840
this case

696
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,720
uh it's it's a it's a guy or a girl

697
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
who's sort of in the infrastructure

698
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
development and malware side of the

699
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,960
business called rashev and that same

700
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,840
negotiator we a negotiator

701
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,960
who was called pin

702
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,799
and in this in this discussion i just

703
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
thought this was interesting they are

704
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,000
talking about targeting

705
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,720
a hospital and rashev is actually

706
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,919
um

707
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,080
what's where he's criticizing or

708
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,679
lambasting pin

709
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,159
for having hit a hospital pin response

710
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
by saying no but it was in the hospital

711
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,520
um i i i watched a hundred times meaning

712
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
i looked at it very very carefully and

713
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
rasheed said nobody looks like a

714
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
hospital and pin responds by saying no

715
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
but they don't do any hospital things

716
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
they just treat sport injuries

717
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,799
and they've got

718
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,159
insurance for three hundred thousand

719
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,559
dollars

720
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
and then rasheed responds by saying okay

721
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
but remember we decided not to touch the

722
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,480
health sector at all

723
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,600
even like this so let's let them go

724
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,440
and i just thought that was interesting

725
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,080
sort of counter insight that shows that

726
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
at least in part

727
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,120
when

728
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,880
some of these groups announce that

729
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
they're not going to target a certain

730
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,039
sector they do kind of mean it but they

731
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,440
maybe don't control it to the extent

732
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
that

733
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,799
that we might like to believe

734
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,640
and i think that's an interesting point

735
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,760
because

736
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,600
one of the things that emerges when you

737
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
examine

738
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,399
the chats like this

739
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,520
is um on the one hand how you know well

740
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,039
organized and

741
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,120
how well they communicate

742
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,559
but on the other hand how kind of

743
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,880
incidental a whole lot of stuff is

744
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,520
so um you know this this targeting of

745
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
the hospital sort of came up in a chat

746
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,440
between pin any sort of manager superior

747
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
um it's not enforced like in a

748
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,760
government you know these things still

749
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
happen whether they decide that they're

750
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,240
going to target health or not

751
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,279
but you know it's not all

752
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,520
it's not always clear as perhaps we like

753
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,880
to think

754
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,720
so critical yes we see it being impacted

755
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,120
but i don't get the impression from any

756
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,600
of the data we have that it's uh that

757
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,279
it's particularly a

758
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
target and i'll make one more point on

759
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,480
this a little bit later again

760
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
folks i hope this is proving interesting

761
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,679
so far

762
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,159
stick with me please and run away

763
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,080
and then i also wanted to talk about

764
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
sophistication because it says in

765
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,919
sophisticated high impact ransomware

766
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,039
attacks i'm not sure exactly what the

767
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,559
report means by sophistication here but

768
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,080
i think they're referring to

769
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,279
[Music]

770
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,039
technical sophistication

771
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,760
and i spotted coincidentally just this

772
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,880
uh

773
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,799
this dialogue you can see i was looking

774
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,880
i've been looking at pen and richev

775
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,399
and their relationship

776
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,799
and uh pin asks rasheed who's on the

777
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,240
development side you know when will the

778
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,159
linux locker be ready

779
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,760
um

780
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,080
and uh and rasheed says yeah well you

781
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,919
know for some it's but it's ready and

782
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,039
tested but

783
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,919
you know there's problems with es6i etc

784
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,720
in other words in 2021 one of the big

785
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,039
advancements um

786
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
that this particular group made is that

787
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,960
they were able to develop a locker so

788
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,480
that's the actual you know ransomware

789
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,799
encryption software that could also run

790
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,200
on linux and you know as an industry

791
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,760
made a big deal of it but actually it's

792
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
not such a big deal

793
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,240
you know to port malware from windows to

794
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,159
uh to linux isn't exactly

795
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,679
game-changing

796
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,679
and so on the

797
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,159
on the question of sophistication i want

798
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,919
to make the point and i'll probably make

799
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,039
it again

800
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,520
that yes they are advancing in terms of

801
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,840
sophistication but actually if you look

802
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,320
at it from a technology point of view we

803
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
think the real innovation is more on the

804
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,799
criminal side than on the cyber side

805
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,960
um and as a meaning it's not so much

806
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,679
about the technical advancement this is

807
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,520
constant and you see it in the chat this

808
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,399
constant cat and mouse game with um you

809
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,279
know the anti-malware uh vendors and so

810
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,440
on but i don't think that's that speaks

811
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
to advancement that's just that's the

812
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,200
game they've been playing for probably

813
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
decades now

814
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,919
um

815
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,080
the the real the interesting innovation

816
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,200
we think is uh more on the business side

817
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,799
of what they're doing than on the

818
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,600
technical side of what they're doing

819
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,559
right

820
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,840
then

821
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
and i'm jumping around in the report a

822
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,559
little bit

823
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,559
uh but the report speaks diver to

824
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
diversifying approaches to extorting

825
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
money and this is a good thing that they

826
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,200
mentioned because we think it's we think

827
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
it's true also

828
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,279
so they talk about triple extortion now

829
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
by threatening to publicly release

830
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,159
stolen and sensitive information disrupt

831
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,360
internet access that's with ddos uh or

832
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,440
dump the um

833
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,360
or dump the data

834
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,279
and again we've got some relatively

835
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,120
solid data on

836
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,320
on this

837
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,360
uh you'll see that in 2020 we almost

838
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,240
exclusively observed just standard data

839
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,330
extortion

840
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,480
[Music]

841
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,399
is that right and no sorry standard

842
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,240
ransom attacks

843
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,679
which is that you know standard

844
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,640
encryption but then in 2021 we started

845
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,820
to see other forms of extortion

846
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,000
[Music]

847
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
of extortion emerging and so now we do

848
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
observe within those kind of 4 000 odd

849
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,600
victims we do observe a diversity of

850
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,799
extortion

851
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,919
methods

852
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,720
and this is a very important thing to

853
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,440
note um even though you'll see the

854
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
percentages are small i can't remember

855
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,320
what the numbers are i looked them up

856
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,519
the other day but it's like less than

857
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,039
six percent

858
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,580
of the of the

859
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,559
[Music]

860
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,679
incidents involve anything other than

861
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,519
standard ransom

862
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,200
but it is emerging

863
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,440
and the reason it's important to note it

864
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,080
is not so much because it changes our

865
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,159
tactics now

866
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,519
but because it illustrates the point

867
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,080
that i was making earlier which is that

868
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,720
um the innovation here is not in the

869
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
technology the innovation is in the form

870
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,840
of crime

871
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,399
so if we improve our technology to the

872
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,519
point

873
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,000
uh or we manage to you know convince

874
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,039
everyone to do backups to the point

875
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,559
that um

876
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
you know traditional ransom through

877
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
encryption

878
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,640
uh

879
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
you know cyber lockers are not effective

880
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,559
anymore then we'll see we'll continue to

881
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,559
see this pivot because the crime is

882
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,159
extortion that's how they're making

883
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,159
their money through extortion the crime

884
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,799
is not packing and that

885
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,360
reorientation is extremely

886
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,880
important

887
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,519
in fact my team and i feel so strongly

888
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,679
about that reorientation that we're

889
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,720
we're in a campaign to convince people

890
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,760
to refer to the crime as cyber extortion

891
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
or science

892
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
which is you'll see in the definition

893
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,799
there's a form of computer crime

894
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,080
in which the security of some asset

895
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
where security can be defined as the

896
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,679
confidentiality the integrity or the

897
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,039
availability of that asset is

898
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,399
compromised

899
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,840
and then used in a thread to exert some

900
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,640
form of uh of payment

901
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,919
and when we choose to define the problem

902
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,640
as a crime cyber extortion rather than

903
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,360
as a technology ransomware

904
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,919
then a whole lot of new things open up

905
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,559
to us for example

906
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,679
we can then examine the prime through

907
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,720
the lens of criminal theory

908
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,880
which which my team and i have done and

909
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,720
and

910
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
surfaced a whole lot of really

911
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,719
interesting perspectives

912
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,119
for example if you if you apply like

913
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,599
traditional um

914
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,119
crime theory

915
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,239
then it suggests that you must have an

916
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,599
offender who's motivated you must have a

917
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,520
victim who is considered suitable or

918
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,599
attractive to the offender and you and

919
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,839
there must be the lack of a guardian so

920
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,918
law enforcement security controls etc

921
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,159
are missing from the equation and when

922
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
those three things converge that's when

923
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,879
a crime can happen

924
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,879
and if you take this

925
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,239
kind of higher level crime oriented view

926
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,399
rather than the lower level

927
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,960
technology oriented view then you can

928
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,399
think about this problem much more

929
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,918
holistically and again i'll come back to

930
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,520
this point later

931
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
so although i do

932
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,079
wholly agree with um

933
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,240
with the report on this comment about

934
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,960
diversification of the extortion

935
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
i'm still disappointed to see people

936
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,359
like uh cesar referring to this as

937
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,400
random way where ransomware deform

938
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,839
defines a form of malware and the form

939
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,920
of malware is not the problem we're

940
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,680
dealing with the problem we're dealing

941
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
with is a form of crime

942
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
called extortion

943
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,400
so this is a crime of extortion

944
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,079
and the how

945
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,320
the how they get something from you to

946
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,560
extort money from you is secondary

947
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
that's not the point and that's going to

948
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,800
continue to evolve and until we can get

949
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
our heads around that

950
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
we're not going to be able to have a

951
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,320
meaningful impact

952
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,800
on this problem

953
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,040
all right i feel like i'm preaching at

954
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,640
you i hope it doesn't feel to you like

955
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,280
i'm preaching at you

956
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,599
so the next point they make is another

957
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,119
point they make is that they then jump

958
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,599
into these these initial axis vectors so

959
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,440
how do the guys get in they get in via

960
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
phishing stolen

961
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,440
rdp credentials

962
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
or brute forcing and exploiting

963
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,359
vulnerabilities so yeah that's i mean

964
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,359
that's pretty much it that's that is

965
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,640
pretty much how anyone gets in anywhere

966
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,960
uh these days so i certainly won't

967
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,440
dispute that and on the left-hand side

968
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
of this you can see our own guidance and

969
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,920
our kind of ransomware guidance report

970
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,680
that we publish that talks about you

971
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,079
know exactly the same sorts of things

972
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,960
and

973
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,280
one of the lovely

974
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,920
outcomes of these

975
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,480
of these negotiations is that the

976
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
criminals will often

977
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,119
disclose in quite a sincere way to the

978
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,160
victim

979
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,839
what they did wrong in order to be

980
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,800
compromised and

981
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
what they should do differently so so

982
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,640
here's guidance from again rasheed to

983
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,440
pin

984
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
on what he should say to the customer

985
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,160
and saying to the customer hey you know

986
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,119
these privilege use unique passwords

987
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,599
check on your admins install an edi has

988
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,960
some good names

989
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
um you know do better with your storage

990
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,079
systems and

991
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,320
you know protect our system so everyone

992
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,720
is in agreement about what needs to be

993
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,520
done

994
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,040
technically or what can be done

995
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,760
technically to block these guys but i

996
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,160
also want to point out to you that

997
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,560
this is not complicated or rocket

998
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,119
science security this is

999
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,800
um we're not asking people to do a lot

1000
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,020
in order to

1001
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,200
[Music]

1002
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,880
if this is what it takes

1003
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
to stop ransomware here's my point if

1004
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,960
this is what it takes to stop uh cyber

1005
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,359
extortion attacks from happening then

1006
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,760
it's very hard to understand how we're

1007
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,079
recording 260 unique new victims a month

1008
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,040
you know

1009
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,200
it's incongruent the the

1010
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,119
simplicity of the technical guidance

1011
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,079
doesn't

1012
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,800
uh correlate or correspond with the

1013
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
volume of victims that we see

1014
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
and the reason for that

1015
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,119
comes from this concept that i

1016
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,400
introduced early on of of the systemic

1017
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,640
factors so i said to you we have this

1018
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,599
model that kind of tries to map

1019
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,839
you know what the underlying systemic

1020
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,079
drivers are that create a particular

1021
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,560
problem and so i can zoom into that

1022
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,680
model

1023
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,880
and

1024
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,040
and zoom in on a problem like cyber

1025
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,880
extortion is persisting

1026
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,599
and then examine what the underlying

1027
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,400
drivers are that

1028
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,680
that bring us to that point so why is

1029
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,320
extortion persisting and what you see

1030
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,680
and i you know i won't have time to

1031
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,839
explain all of these drivers but what

1032
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,200
you see is there are literally a myriad

1033
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,280
of powerful underlying systemic forces

1034
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
that put us in the position today

1035
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,400
where this crime of cyber extortion

1036
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
continues to um

1037
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,400
to persist

1038
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,480
and um and and you can imagine you know

1039
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
what many of them are cryptocurrencies

1040
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,040
is a big contributor you know insurance

1041
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,599
is a big contributor security debt is a

1042
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,520
big contributor

1043
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
and lack of

1044
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
repercussions for the criminals is a big

1045
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
uh is a big contributor

1046
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,280
ineffective law enforcement is a big

1047
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,520
contributor etc etc

1048
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,720
etc

1049
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,560
and the the reason i introduced this

1050
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,880
into the discussion now is to make the

1051
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,359
point that with this volume with this

1052
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,560
weight of systemic pressure on a problem

1053
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,880
the idea that we're going to deflect

1054
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,640
this problem will significantly reduce

1055
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,359
it

1056
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,880
by implementing some security basics

1057
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
in my mind is

1058
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,880
naive that that is not going to happen

1059
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
and

1060
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,000
but if you zoom out as i suggested

1061
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,640
earlier and and you look at this from

1062
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,119
from a holistic perspective uh that

1063
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,800
involves like how do i how do i

1064
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
demotivate the offender how do i make

1065
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
the victim less suitable

1066
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,200
and how do i put guardians in place then

1067
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,440
some other perspectives

1068
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,400
emerge

1069
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,560
and so speaking of the defender of the

1070
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
offender in the top left

1071
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,200
the first one that emerges there and

1072
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,640
i've just highlighted a few of these

1073
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,800
points that i think are important is

1074
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,040
that we need to reduce the flow of funds

1075
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,839
from victims the conti leak showed us so

1076
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,720
clearly how money washes through this

1077
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,160
environment all via cryptocurrencies and

1078
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,720
there is a bitcoin address in every

1079
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,440
second message in those in those chats

1080
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
money's going in and out of the bitcoin

1081
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,000
ecosystem and until that money stops

1082
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,920
flowing until these guys stop

1083
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
either getting rich or just living off

1084
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,839
the money as normal kind of technical

1085
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,400
guys we're not going to put it in this

1086
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
crime

1087
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,960
on the right hand side

1088
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,680
we we make the point that in terms of

1089
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,359
guardianship

1090
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,119
so this is the thing that's supposed to

1091
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
intervene and prevent a crime from

1092
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,800
happening

1093
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
we really think that security

1094
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
technologies

1095
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
are

1096
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,839
not going to be able to provide the kind

1097
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
of guardianship that's needed

1098
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,200
and i'm not going to explain this in

1099
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
detail now with the time that we have

1100
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
but i invite you if you find this topic

1101
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,839
interesting to have a look on our

1102
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,400
website um we've published a full paper

1103
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,319
on this so ping me and i'll send you a

1104
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,440
message

1105
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,760
um but we think there's several reasons

1106
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,839
why

1107
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,200
this you know this crime is not going to

1108
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,800
be stopped by putting better locks or

1109
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,920
gates

1110
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,760
on our you know better gates or locks on

1111
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,040
our doors and what's really needed is

1112
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,359
a concerted partnership effort that

1113
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,960
includes

1114
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,079
the victim and is prepared to engage

1115
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,200
with this criminal to stand up to them

1116
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,599
in a way by operating as a

1117
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,680
as a community as a collector

1118
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,079
and then as far as the suitability of

1119
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,319
the victim is concerned how do you make

1120
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,800
the victim less attractive so there are

1121
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,240
certainly things that the victim or

1122
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,720
potential victim can do

1123
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,319
but as i've highlighted there and it

1124
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,000
includes things like you know decreasing

1125
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
vulnerability make sure you patch your

1126
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,200
stuff absolutely

1127
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,040
um but i think there are several other

1128
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,960
things you can do including

1129
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,599
just reducing your attack surface

1130
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,280
being agile in detection and response

1131
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,000
and then recognizing that when the crime

1132
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,680
is cyber extortion

1133
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,920
what the criminal is stealing is not

1134
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
something that's of value to them

1135
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,960
but something that's of value to you

1136
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,480
so if you can reduce the apparent value

1137
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,880
of a digital asset to yourself

1138
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,560
you um

1139
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,800
you reduce the likelihood of this crime

1140
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
attacking and i know that maybe sounds a

1141
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,000
bit ridiculous but if you

1142
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,160
uh you know take that home as homework

1143
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,560
and think about that idea with extortion

1144
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,240
you know this famous uh scene there's

1145
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,000
always this scene in the in the old

1146
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,640
american russian uh army movies

1147
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,920
where um

1148
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,440
the you know the good guy is taking

1149
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,960
somebody hostage he's like

1150
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,000
he's in a corner and and he grabs the

1151
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,359
you know he grabs the bad guy's

1152
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,520
girlfriend and he hides behind her with

1153
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,240
the gun and he's like okay i'm safe now

1154
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,760
because i'm shielded behind this um

1155
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,079
behind this innocence and his reasoning

1156
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,800
is because i have something of value to

1157
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,520
the bad guy i can now ex i can extort

1158
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,440
him i've got leverage and what does the

1159
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,960
bad guy do you've all seen the movie

1160
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,800
immediately shoots the victim the bad

1161
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
guy then shoots the spur defenseless

1162
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,560
woman dead so she disappears as a shield

1163
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,119
he's reduced the value of that thing to

1164
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,280
himself that's the idea that i think we

1165
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,920
should ponder and i would invite you to

1166
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,720
think on it a little bit

1167
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,480
okay so

1168
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
my summary of that whole thing about the

1169
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,640
guidance is yes it's absolutely good

1170
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
guidance we give the same guidance even

1171
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,040
the criminals give that guidance but

1172
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,680
this is not a problem of technology

1173
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,079
and you know you're not going to stop a

1174
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,720
countrywide mafia gang by putting better

1175
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
locks on your on your door you have to

1176
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,800
understand how they operate understand

1177
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,520
where their mind goes use intelligence

1178
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,040
stand up to them like you would stand up

1179
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,960
to other other bullies

1180
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,640
and engage with them if we're going to

1181
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,880
make this problem go away anything else

1182
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,200
is just putting our finger in holes in

1183
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,640
the dyke

1184
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,720
having said that i think there is one

1185
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,800
technology thing you can do and forgive

1186
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,680
me for the poor quality of this um

1187
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,079
image but i think you can uh hope for

1188
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,839
the best and plan for the worst in other

1189
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,359
words

1190
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,359
response and recovery

1191
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,040
are essential technical disciplines

1192
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,000
and

1193
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,640
i think much more could be done to kind

1194
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,119
of think carefully about what it would

1195
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,200
feel like if your systems got

1196
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,440
compromised in this way and your data

1197
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,920
got encrypted or you got ddos and making

1198
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,480
sure that you have a plan that is that

1199
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
is ready that it's tested and has been

1200
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,799
exercised

1201
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,839
all right we're um we're sort of

1202
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,920
trotting on towards the the end i do

1203
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,119
still have a little bit of time i hope

1204
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,800
you're all still awake

1205
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,680
um

1206
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,760
so then they talk in the report about

1207
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,240
this idea of using cyber criminal

1208
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,960
services for hire this market is

1209
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,400
becoming professionalized and the

1210
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,079
criminal business model is well

1211
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,920
established i think everybody knows that

1212
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,200
to be true

1213
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,079
um

1214
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:10,880
and

1215
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,040
we in fact in our paper make the

1216
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,200
argument that

1217
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,480
we are

1218
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,079
dealing with several crimes that are

1219
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,760
being committed by

1220
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,079
several different kinds of people

1221
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,040
um

1222
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,000
in several different places

1223
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,839
and some of them you know we recognize

1224
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,240
we recognize the initial access broker

1225
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,079
is that the crew that does the initial

1226
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,839
hack uh we recognize the affiliates who

1227
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,000
consume services from the operator and

1228
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,680
uses that to

1229
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,760
do the exfiltration encryption and then

1230
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,520
we we have the operator themselves who

1231
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,160
develop the tools put the sites in place

1232
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
etc etc

1233
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,280
in fact

1234
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,599
though and i uh forgive me please for

1235
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,800
the for the

1236
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,560
quality of this picture but it's really

1237
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,319
just to illustrate a point

1238
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,560
if you map out the players in that

1239
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,359
ecosystem there is much much more than

1240
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,000
just those kind of three levels

1241
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,560
um and i think we you know we talk about

1242
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,240
like services for higher but really what

1243
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,920
you're looking at is a business

1244
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,720
ecosystem with the with the supply chain

1245
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,040
and it kind of operates as an ecology

1246
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,400
and there are

1247
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,520
um

1248
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,160
you know hundreds if not thousands of

1249
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,760
people engaged in some elements of this

1250
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,960
operation

1251
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,800
and that's interesting and important to

1252
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,960
us not just because it's you know

1253
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,040
fascinating to learn that they they

1254
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,440
operate like real businesses

1255
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,160
but also because it gives you a sense of

1256
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,920
how

1257
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
robust and persistent this is going to

1258
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,240
be you know you can you can catch one

1259
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,920
guy and lock him up

1260
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,960
um but to tear an ecosystem like this

1261
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,000
down

1262
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,480
um really requires like market results

1263
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,560
it's a big job and it's another reason

1264
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
why this problem isn't simply going to

1265
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,480
go away

1266
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,960
and we see it illustrated beautifully

1267
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
in the in the county league so as i

1268
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,480
mentioned to you

1269
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,240
204 000 messages in

1270
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,560
2021 alone about 160

1271
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,960
about 160 different players

1272
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,800
and we've started to make sense of it i

1273
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,560
know this picture doesn't

1274
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,920
it doesn't look like we're making sense

1275
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,200
of it

1276
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,720
but we you know we

1277
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,599
we can identify the different players we

1278
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,520
can track the message flows from one to

1279
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
another and you can sort of start to see

1280
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,480
who the uh you know who who the big guys

1281
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,880
are in this and how they cluster

1282
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,119
together and so some of those messages

1283
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,800
and those old structures that i shared

1284
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,640
with you earlier are coming from

1285
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,720
um our work to kind of understand you

1286
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,160
know what's happening around stern

1287
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,480
what's happening around defender what

1288
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
role does dollar play who are these guys

1289
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,520
that orient around trump and pumbaa

1290
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,760
and in this way we can start to

1291
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,240
sort of tease out how they operate

1292
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,160
um but the other thing i wanted to point

1293
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,839
out which is which i found was really

1294
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,000
interesting is when we built this bra

1295
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,760
i kind of anticipated that there'd be

1296
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,920
very clear clusters you know a cluster

1297
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,720
for

1298
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,119
development in malware a cluster for

1299
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,960
finance and management cluster for

1300
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,079
whatever

1301
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,599
um but one of the first things that

1302
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,520
strikes you when you look at it is

1303
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,760
actually how intermeshed it is

1304
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,520
everyone there are exceptions you see

1305
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,119
these guys on the outsides that are sort

1306
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,280
of just talking to one big player but in

1307
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,680
the middle there's a vast amount of

1308
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,000
communications going up and down between

1309
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,200
these

1310
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,440
these different players and it's very

1311
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,280
if you like almost

1312
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,280
a flat structure you know despite what

1313
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,359
everybody says

1314
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,319
so

1315
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,240
the point to take away from this so far

1316
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,640
is that this is a crime ecosystem and

1317
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,119
because it's an ecosystem it scales it

1318
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,200
adapts and persists

1319
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,599
don't don't fall into the trap of

1320
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,920
thinking that there's one guy or one

1321
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,040
group

1322
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,960
that have to be taken down or one piece

1323
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,680
of malware that we have to solve for um

1324
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,240
you know think about how you would end

1325
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,520
well think about how successful we've

1326
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,119
been at ending the drug trade for

1327
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,200
example and that'll give you a sense of

1328
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,920
what the problem is that we're facing

1329
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,000
they also talk about in the report

1330
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,359
uh moving away from big game hunting

1331
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,680
which is this idea that um

1332
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,119
you know big businesses were being

1333
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,960
specifically targeted and i can very

1334
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,559
quickly point out

1335
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,200
that in our data across the board but in

1336
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,440
this case i've just visualized the sort

1337
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,359
of five biggest players from our entire

1338
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,720
data set

1339
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,200
they predominantly target what we would

1340
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,880
call smaller businesses small small

1341
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,559
small small small small little bit of

1342
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,359
medium almost no big businesses

1343
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,440
having said that

1344
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,599
part of the reason is because our

1345
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,839
internal definition of small

1346
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,599
is any business with up to a thousand

1347
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,839
employees so small is not like the two

1348
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,440
or three man shop

1349
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,640
um

1350
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,920
it's you know it can still be a

1351
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,119
substantial business but we um

1352
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,960
and very many businesses would fall into

1353
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,440
that category but

1354
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,480
but

1355
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,000
despite that and overall i think we

1356
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,040
would agree with this assessment that um

1357
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,960
big game hunting is actually a little

1358
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,200
bit of a fantasy

1359
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,760
and i think the reason that that's uh

1360
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,599
important is that even the term hunting

1361
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,280
is wrong i don't think that hunting

1362
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,599
happens in this

1363
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,440
in this system this is more like a

1364
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,559
harvest

1365
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,680
um and it's driven by opportunism and

1366
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,079
internal market forces the guys you know

1367
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,480
the initial access brokers uh they're

1368
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,760
not hunters they you know they're

1369
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,800
walking around picking fruit off trees

1370
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,960
um and then once they've picked a whole

1371
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,839
basket of fruit and they bring it back

1372
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,839
it's internal market forces that

1373
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,000
determine who actually gets victimized

1374
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,440
and that's based on you know what's this

1375
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,079
business worth or um

1376
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,160
do we understand what language they

1377
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,040
speak or do we have time for them or

1378
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,200
anybody even notice them

1379
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,720
being compromised and one of the saddest

1380
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,520
things of looking at those breaches

1381
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,319
um the internal chats is you see victims

1382
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,319
being completely forgotten somebody gets

1383
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,839
owned and his um you know they end up on

1384
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,720
some internal tracking system

1385
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,040
they're called newbies

1386
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,800
and and nobody notices and so this

1387
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,400
victim just sits there you know in a

1388
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
database somewhere and none of the

1389
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,599
criminals even bother to process them

1390
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,960
so

1391
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,400
yeah i think we need to move away from

1392
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,200
terms like hunting and i prefer the term

1393
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,240
harvest

1394
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,319
because it reflects that anybody and

1395
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,400
anything may be caught up in the

1396
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,480
internet

1397
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,119
okay they also talk about in the report

1398
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,440
the idea that organizations

1399
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,680
get targeted and again they use the term

1400
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,680
targeted which i'm not sure they what

1401
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,119
they mean by that

1402
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,559
um

1403
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,960
on holidays and and weekends

1404
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,040
uh when we look at the data we can

1405
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,200
firstly look at the at the threat data

1406
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,440
so when did the leaks actually happen

1407
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,520
um and one of the things we noticed is

1408
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,480
that there were significant dips

1409
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,440
in

1410
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,920
january of the the two januaries that

1411
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,440
we've got to observe

1412
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,640
now there are possibly um

1413
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,400
other factors like for example the

1414
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,880
tricked up trickbot takedown or maybe

1415
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,240
the uh

1416
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,960
the rival arrests that may have sparked

1417
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,480
uh those dips

1418
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,720
um but it is it is quite

1419
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,280
noteworthy i think that

1420
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,720
these actors actually seem to slow down

1421
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,520
over christmas for example uh rather

1422
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,839
than speed up

1423
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,280
let's look at those same leaks

1424
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
by day of week so what days of the week

1425
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,119
do the leaks happen

1426
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,720
and i've organized it from monday on the

1427
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,040
left to sunday on the right so there you

1428
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,760
see the the weekends day seven and day

1429
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,800
one um and it seems to us that the leaks

1430
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,119
are overwhelmingly uh not happening on

1431
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,079
weekends but that's of course the

1432
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:59,200
external perspective right that's what

1433
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,319
we see when we uh

1434
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,839
when we look at the leaks which is an

1435
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,160
outcome but what about the their own

1436
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,200
activity

1437
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,359
so if we look at their own chat activity

1438
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,520
here on the on the left

1439
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,839
you see those same dips happening again

1440
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:14,800
in

1441
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,640
the end of the year

1442
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,480
maybe again for other reasons but it

1443
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,800
does seem noteworthy

1444
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,319
and if we look at the kind of

1445
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,760
organizational let's call this the

1446
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,000
company chat which is jabba

1447
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,200
you see it dipping again significantly

1448
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,319
um

1449
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,800
on saturday and sunday and if you look

1450
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,480
at their technical chat which is the

1451
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,000
rocker chat so what are the hackers

1452
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,040
doing same thing tips significantly on

1453
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,440
the weekend so i'm not saying these guys

1454
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,200
don't engage on weekends and i'm not

1455
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,559
saying that you know if you hit

1456
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,839
solarwinds or caseya or you know some

1457
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,119
other big target that you're not going

1458
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,040
to be smart enough to work when they're

1459
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,400
not working

1460
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,800
but overwhelmingly the impression we get

1461
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,040
is that these guys work a pretty regular

1462
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,640
work week

1463
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,839
and we

1464
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,240
we observe something similar when we

1465
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,800
look at our data of the incidents that

1466
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,079
we detect

1467
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,760
for our customers

1468
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,680
so in this graph we've taken customers

1469
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,280
across the world and we've measured how

1470
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,200
many incidents we

1471
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,079
confirmed incidents we deal with on an

1472
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,760
hour-by-hour basis during the day

1473
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,160
and what you see is that the number of

1474
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,960
incidents tracks the average working day

1475
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,400
almost perfectly right so early in the

1476
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,800
morning late in the evening very little

1477
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,480
uh

1478
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,000
over lunch time there's a nice little

1479
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,559
gap when the incidents stop happening

1480
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,119
and um and so it peters off right this

1481
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,400
this is just a graph of working hours

1482
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,240
um and so this is interesting to me

1483
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,839
because

1484
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,440
you might argue that it says the

1485
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,720
attacker is working working hours

1486
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,280
um and even taking a break at lunchtime

1487
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,359
but because we've normalized it across

1488
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,480
countries

1489
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,160
this isn't showing

1490
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,079
when the attacker is operating this is

1491
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,280
showing when the victim is operating

1492
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,640
and i want to show you another graph

1493
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
which is going to help me make the point

1494
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,359
that i want to make which is a graph in

1495
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,920
which we correlate the number of

1496
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,440
incidents

1497
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,319
that we record with our customers in

1498
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,599
this case we're looking specifically at

1499
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,920
droppers and downloaders so the early

1500
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,559
stage of a ransomware attack and we

1501
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,319
correlated with covert lockdowns so the

1502
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,640
lockdown severity

1503
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
so the gray bars at the top show how

1504
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,440
severe the lockdowns are and the orange

1505
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,160
bar shows how many droppers

1506
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,520
we record

1507
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,839
in our threat detection business

1508
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,200
and basically you see an inverse

1509
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,960
correlation so you'll see as the

1510
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,319
severity

1511
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,000
of the lockdowns increase in the

1512
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,119
beginning of january the number of

1513
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,599
you know ransomware related security

1514
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,319
incidents decreases and as the lockdown

1515
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,240
starts to

1516
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,799
decrease in june july the number of

1517
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,960
incidents increase

1518
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,839
and what that says to us is that the

1519
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,760
volume of security

1520
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,760
incidents is correlated with victim user

1521
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,280
behavior

1522
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,240
more than it's correlated with attacker

1523
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,559
behavior or at least as much

1524
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,559
so we can definitely see

1525
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,359
that the attackers work kind of normal

1526
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,640
business hours in their time zones

1527
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,680
but actually the number of incidents

1528
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,359
um that we record is just as impacted

1529
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,839
by what the victim is doing

1530
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,240
than what the attacker is doing and

1531
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,079
that's very largely to do with the fact

1532
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,079
that the computer needs to be on the

1533
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,319
victim needs to click on the link

1534
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,000
you know you need to install the

1535
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,680
malicious software that's been sent to

1536
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,319
you whatever the whatever the case is

1537
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,440
and so

1538
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,640
um

1539
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,359
in

1540
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,160
in summary of that section we don't see

1541
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,799
strong evidence in our data

1542
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:55,599
that

1543
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,119
on a large scale attacks are happening

1544
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,400
on weekends or

1545
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,680
holidays

1546
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,400
we do see sort of a peak almost always

1547
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,880
during the summer holidays

1548
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,839
which

1549
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,160
may be some opportunism on behalf of the

1550
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,880
attacker but we think that the patterns

1551
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,480
we see

1552
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,960
have as much to do with

1553
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,440
the patterns of the target as they do

1554
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,960
with the behaviors of the attacker

1555
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,960
folks i'm aware i've got five minutes

1556
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,559
left and

1557
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,680
i

1558
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,520
had a few more points to cover but

1559
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,440
rather than kind of

1560
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,559
blast through that um let me let me

1561
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:33,760
summarize maybe there's time for

1562
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,839
questions so we see the problems growing

1563
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,559
it's global but it's shaped globally and

1564
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,559
that shape is changing

1565
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,040
um we think that when critical systems

1566
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,200
are hit but that's a problem of impact

1567
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,280
not a problem of likelihood

1568
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,960
uh we think that crime is getting more

1569
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,200
sophisticated not the technology it's

1570
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,119
not about big game hunting it's about

1571
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,960
harvesting

1572
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,720
we think the patterns we observe have

1573
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,040
got as much to do with the behavior of

1574
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,520
the victim as of the attacker

1575
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,280
we think that

1576
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,480
you should

1577
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
hope for the best and plan for the worst

1578
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,640
technically invest in response and

1579
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,680
recovery

1580
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,280
and then i had a whole point about old

1581
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,599
men shouting at clowns but i think i've

1582
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,760
done enough shouting at clouds for today

1583
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,000
so i'm going to stop there and say thank

1584
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,760
you for your time

1585
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,599
please take a moment to connect with me

1586
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,280
on on social media particularly on

1587
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,200
twitter but also i'd love to hear from

1588
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,119
you get your feedback

1589
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,680
and make a connection

1590
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,520
it's actually thank you very much that

1591
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,079
was really awesome thank you so much so

1592
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,960
we do have a few questions

1593
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,400
so the first question is uh in terms of

1594
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,440
uh just looking at their psychology and

1595
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,880
demographics

1596
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,839
uh do they have certain set of hierarchy

1597
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,559
uh in terms of experience like a leader

1598
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,440
who wants or guides the group uh this is

1599
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,680
in the reference to the health care uh

1600
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,960
attack chat as one of them warned uh can

1601
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,680
be

1602
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,799
a leader

1603
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,760
or or not to touch health care but the

1604
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,400
other members was all set to execute the

1605
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,319
attack not mature in terms of

1606
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,839
understanding the consequences

1607
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,240
um that that's an excellent question and

1608
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,200
the the sort of common opinion is that

1609
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,319
they do have clear leaders or a core

1610
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,079
group

1611
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,240
that interact in some some way and call

1612
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,680
the shots

1613
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,400
but to be honest i i haven't been able

1614
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,160
to

1615
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,240
identify that yet there are some players

1616
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,119
that very clearly emerge near the top um

1617
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,400
like stern and mango

1618
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,880
and and you and you see them using you

1619
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,280
know manager or leadership language you

1620
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,559
know they

1621
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,400
they they'll criticize

1622
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,799
they'll uh they'll get angry they'll

1623
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,359
give directions they'll demand things

1624
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,359
uh you can sort of make stern out on the

1625
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,280
top left-hand side there

1626
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,160
um

1627
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,200
as a key as a key player um

1628
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,559
but there's also a large degree of just

1629
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,440
sort of democratic collaboration you

1630
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,680
know let's do this or i already did that

1631
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,160
or dude i didn't hear from you so i went

1632
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,280
ahead

1633
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,079
um

1634
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,160
but the place you see the power is in

1635
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,640
the is in the money flows

1636
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,040
um and and uh

1637
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,119
it's very clear that some people

1638
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,760
manage the money and uh and therefore

1639
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,920
have a certain kind of authority there

1640
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,599
but it doesn't behave in my mind like a

1641
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,079
like a business organization not

1642
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,640
culturally

1643
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,359
all right uh how often are these

1644
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,599
ransomware attacks politically uh

1645
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,799
motivated and what are observations on

1646
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,640
growing ransomware as a service

1647
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,720
activities

1648
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,119
yeah it's also a good question

1649
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,920
um so motivation is a very difficult

1650
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,359
thing to

1651
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,640
pin down because it's it's complex

1652
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,200
and you also need to tease out

1653
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,839
motivation and justification

1654
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,200
um

1655
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,599
diana who is the criminology star team

1656
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,480
uses the term neutralization

1657
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,040
um so there's two elements why

1658
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,359
why do they do it and why do they say

1659
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,559
they did it

1660
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,559
um and when you say

1661
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,079
uh why you did it you're saying that

1662
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,839
partly to yourself

1663
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,078
but

1664
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,119
partly to others but also uh partly to

1665
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,400
yourself

1666
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,839
um

1667
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,599
so i know that's a long-winded answer

1668
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,280
but so your question was how often is it

1669
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,000
politically motivated yeah

1670
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,640
we don't i i don't think we know how

1671
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,599
often it's politically motivated

1672
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,960
because it's hard to look into the heart

1673
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,520
of someone if i were to guess

1674
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,760
we think this is about money

1675
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,440
99 common line it's about about money

1676
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,000
but what you do see is politics being

1677
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
used in the neutralization or the

1678
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,760
justification and there's very clear

1679
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,200
evidence of that

1680
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,680
the major one being the rift within

1681
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,680
conti that led us getting these leaks at

1682
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,799
all

1683
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,359
was a was a argument about

1684
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,839
pro russia versus

1685
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,839
pro ukraine

1686
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,359
and that caused so much tension within

1687
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,480
the group that they you know they

1688
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,200
actually kind of turned on each other

1689
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,000
and we also see for example a little

1690
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,720
banner that these guys will use on their

1691
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,640
communications platforms that

1692
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,280
effectively says we don't hack russia

1693
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,599
you know we're pro-russian we're we're

1694
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,160
patriotic

1695
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,440
but i

1696
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,760
have yet to see

1697
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,559
the primary motivation

1698
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,200
for any significant group of these guys

1699
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,000
being

1700
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,920
political the primary motivation is to

1701
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,640
make money and they use politics maybe

1702
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,039
to shape their victimology or to justify

1703
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,799
this the crime to themselves or others

1704
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,280
all right uh next question we have from

1705
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,160
tony uh is it a reasonable conclusion

1706
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,640
that by improving security

1707
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,200
you don't prevent the crime but do

1708
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,160
prevent the crime on a particular victim

1709
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,480
if the effort to attack his increase

1710
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,559
will an attacker move to a different

1711
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,960
target

1712
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,599
um

1713
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,760
for him this has been the fundamental

1714
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,920
difference between a criminal attack and

1715
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,359
an apd attack and abd more likely has a

1716
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,160
particular target in mind hence can be

1717
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,960
more persistent

1718
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,400
um

1719
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,359
tony

1720
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,359
yeah i think i think that is i think

1721
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,640
that's so firstly your distinction

1722
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,039
between apt and criminal tracks is

1723
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,880
absolutely correct you know if a

1724
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,079
significantly resourced division of the

1725
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,000
chinese

1726
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,400
you know cyber army decides to come

1727
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,599
after you

1728
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:46,720
um

1729
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,559
you're going to have a hard time you

1730
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,119
know and they're not going to give up

1731
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,839
um whereas the these criminal

1732
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,920
actors as i've said are harvesting i

1733
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,440
think not hunting

1734
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,599
um so you know if they can't tug you off

1735
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,000
the tree for the first few times they

1736
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,400
are going to um

1737
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,839
they're going they're going to move on

1738
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:06,720
you know

1739
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,440
you're going to you're going to survive

1740
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,039
so in that sense i think you're right

1741
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,000
but where i think we need to be careful

1742
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,400
is in

1743
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,799
um

1744
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,400
is in

1745
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,480
in the

1746
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,480
in the way we understand the linearity

1747
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,359
of this

1748
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,320
so

1749
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,319
[Music]

1750
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,480
that just just like the this harvesting

1751
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,119
mechanism is opportunistic the hacking

1752
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,839
mechanism itself is also opportunistic

1753
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,839
in other words um

1754
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,240
the the the volume of attacks that

1755
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,079
you're facing isn't so much because one

1756
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,240
guy is going after you

1757
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,000
over and over and over again it's

1758
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
because lots of guys are going over

1759
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
after lots of people

1760
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,880
um

1761
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,480
and there's a very good chance that you

1762
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,319
get caught in the crossfire i don't know

1763
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,799
if i'm making sense tony but um

1764
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,760
i i think it would be um

1765
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,920
a mistake to think that they sort of

1766
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,559
come knocking at your door and then try

1767
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,920
two or three times and when that's too

1768
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,280
hard they move on

1769
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,039
um i think they're just trying

1770
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,440
everywhere all the time and so if you

1771
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,039
make a mistake

1772
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,079
somewhere

1773
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,160
um the chances are that mistake is going

1774
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,558
to cost you

1775
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,960
all right so we are almost exceeding the

1776
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,280

1777
