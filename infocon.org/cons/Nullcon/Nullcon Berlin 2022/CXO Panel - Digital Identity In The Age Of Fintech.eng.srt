1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
hello welcome i'm benoit flippen i am

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,280
the ciso for scout 24

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,840
and we have a lovely panel here to talk

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
about identity problems in fintechs and

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,800
i think that will also

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
be relevant outside the fintech space

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,840
because identity is a pretty big topic

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,359
and i do actually want to have each of

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,720
the panelists quickly introduce

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
themselves so about a minute each

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,240
why don't we start all the way on the

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,039
right keto

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,840
hey

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
my name is good heisman i'm doing

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
security at solar spunk so solarspang is

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,440
like

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,360
the european biggest banking as a

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
service platform

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,440
and we enable other

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
companies fintechs

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,640
to embed financial services into

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879
their own products and i'm doing

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,120
security there for six years

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,079
um

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
building a team

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
establishing a security management

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,079
there and

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,520
yeah pretty

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
tough ride at that fast growing company

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
hello

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,880
i'm alessandro i work at nuri here in

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,560
berlin uh notice uh assado security and

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
infrastructure so we basically provide

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
um

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
where one of the companies that solaris

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
bank actually enables so it's uh our

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,640
back end for the banking side and we

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
provide uh

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
the possibility for customers to have a

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
bank account integrated with crypto uh

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
products so we're more like on the

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
investment type rather than exchange and

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,680
uh

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
i'm most involved also let's say my team

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
spans gross information security plus

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,798
product security and many other artists

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
so hi i'm sheeta i have i'm the ceso of

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,720
finoa you know is a cryptocustodian

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
company i have around 20 years of

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,920
experience in information security and i

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
really look forward to answering any

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
questions you may have

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
hello um so my name is travis kerlock i

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,919
am the cso for n26 bank well group um

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,400
and so yeah i've been in the technical

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,120
side for most of my career and then

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,720
recently moved over to the dark side of

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,239
management probably about three years

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
ago

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,238
yeah and enjoying it

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
yeah so why don't we jump right in um

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,360
the interesting thing for me

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
about

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
the whole topic of authentication and

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
authorization is that to me this is the

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
most central topic in security like who

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
has access to what

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,440
we as security professionals need to

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
ensure you know only the right people

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
can access the right resources we have

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,720
to understand who is who

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
but this is something that in my

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
is almost never actually managed or done

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
by the security team themselves and

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
pretty much every place i've worked

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
there's been a difference of how much

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,000
involvement how much oversight there is

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,239
between security and operations either

79
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
on the product or the internal side

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
so i guess my first question to the

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,959
panelists is you know in your companies

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,040
how much role does the security team

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
have in

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,200
either defining or operationalizing or

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,879
oversight or whatever of the

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
authentication infrastructure in your

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
companies so

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640
who wants to jump in first

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
i i'll go

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,280
um so there's there's two types right

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
there's internal authentication so for

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
your employees and your uh and there's

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
for your customers

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
so uh for our customer point of view

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
that is uh product and engineering teams

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,879
that work on that

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,480
um they uh they they're they're our off

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,920
team however um our product security

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
teams probably like most you are

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
embedded in all of our engineering teams

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
um so you know cross-functional type of

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
teams so everything has to go through

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,959
kind of a security review for release

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,840
um and then also in addition to that we

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
also have another layer

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
of a team called our trust and safety

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
team that actually looks at

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,080
uh kind of the process flow and the va

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
and the verification mechanisms um and

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,279
any kind of gaps there so we do a lot of

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,560
threat modeling uh so for example

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
you know uh i don't know if yeah it may

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,600
it may be for the fintech but i think it

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,199
happens for everyone people are watching

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,800
your flows all the time

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
and so whenever you change say say you

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
need a customer loses their phone so in

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,639
fintech like we repair customers phones

119
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,280
after the know your customer process um

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
sorry this might be too many banking

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
terms

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
but um but yeah and so uh yeah so we

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
trust we we we develop a trust

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
relationship with your phone almost as a

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
second factor um and so if you lose your

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
phone that's a big that's a big deal um

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,479
and so we have this trust and safety

128
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,960
team that goes through uh also does uh

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,160
this like this process view of how could

130
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
um how could this how could our flows be

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
leveraged leveraged for account

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,919
takeovers and things like that and then

133
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
on the internal side

134
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
that is actually in our security team or

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
at least in our security group so we

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
have an information security group

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
there's about six teams under there and

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,479
iam identity and access management team

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,039
is is squarely in that org

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,280
now we do have a tech ops

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
division and they kind of handle

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
day-to-day but the people that set up

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
the actual engineering and the

144
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
structures are part of the security

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
group

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
so

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,039
okay

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
so well at finra so it's uh it of course

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
you know when when you think about

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
introduction of uh

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
of topics like uh you know insecurity as

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
such in a company you also have to think

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,080
about the size of the company right so i

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,160
come from a company that that is at the

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
moment smaller than in 26 but i would

156
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
say also much more riskier

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
uh because of the of the kind of

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,880
business that we are in

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
so uh when we have um when when i'm when

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
i'm trying to roll this out i see it at

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,039
as um

162
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,840
and in three different levels so first

163
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
at the policy level where you state

164
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
exactly what you want and you try to

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
understand

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,319
in in like from the buff in introduction

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
um you know

168
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,160
requirements and from the bait

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
requirements which is also the

170
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,280
banking requirements coming for it

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
coming from buffing we try to understand

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,919
exactly what regulatory environment is

173
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,000
looking for and try to convert that into

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
a policy that can be accepted then of

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,120
course you know as travis has very

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
beautifully put it it's not something

177
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
that the security team can completely be

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,639
responsible for be accountable for it

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
but we're not responsible for it

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
and these responsibilities lie with

181
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
different teams then you know so for

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
instance if it is internal of course

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,440
it's somewhere within tech ops who are

184
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
really handling those tools that can

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,000
manage that kind of internal single sign

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,479
on and

187
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
ensure that there is identity in access

188
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
management for our employees then of

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,599
course the parts that's relating to the

190
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
product you know how we authenticate our

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
customers there again it is the product

192
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,120
team uh and

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,199
as he rightly said you have to threat

194
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,919
model you have to be very careful

195
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
i'm coming from a banking environment so

196
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,800
we are very very careful and we do our

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
due diligence very well so right from

198
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
the start of the product when you think

199
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,599
about

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
about um what kind of structures you

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,680
would need you would have to also keep

202
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
identity and access management in mind

203
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,720
and threats that can come out of it at

204
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,960
various levels and make sure that you

205
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
are addressing this

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
this

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,919
making sure that you're addressing it is

208
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,400
the responsibility then is in in my

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,440
company which is a not as big as as

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
telefonica sorry as uh n26

211
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,680
uh we have um

212
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,479
the security engineering team which will

213
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,199
then ensure that these requirements that

214
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
we have brought out in the threat

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,960
modeling is basically um vetted and

216
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,919
checked and implemented so that's that's

217
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
how we have implemented it and i pass on

218
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
to you

219
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,720
yeah

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,080
for those who don't know can you quickly

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
tell people what the buffing is

222
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,958
okay

223
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,519
who's who's who's who's good in german

224
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,479
here

225
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,360
okay

226
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
it's a tongue twister

227
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,240
it's i would i would i would like to

228
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
hand over to a german

229
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
widow yes

230
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,640
yeah

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,440
so it's a bundes of 16 financing so it's

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,399
a german governance organization that

233
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
oversees

234
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
the banks in germany gives the banking

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,279
licenses

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,360
and also the right bank has a bank full

237
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
german banking license so we also need

238
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
to

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
stick to their roles which is um defined

240
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
in the so-called

241
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
there to stand the most important

242
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
standard is called emma risk and there's

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
the bit which is more concrete

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
on an ite

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,560
level and also there's a lot of security

246
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
um

247
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
um requirements there so they find that

248
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,760
you have to have a security management

249
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
system so we as a large punk set up iso

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
2701

251
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,760
as a standard

252
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,000
and they defined that you have to have

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
information security

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
risk management

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
and so on so and um

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
when you come to

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
access management so at banks you need

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,480
to also um divide

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,399
between first and second line so there

260
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,080
is also a third line which is like the

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
auditors

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,160
um

263
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
and secure so as a verify the

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
information security team we are in the

265
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,959
second line so we are more like the ones

266
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,279
defining the requirements

267
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
uh for for the access management so this

268
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
means

269
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
we define the process so how should

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
access be granted

271
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
to applications to employees what are

272
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
like the default permissions when

273
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
developers start for example

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
how do they get higher permissions how

275
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
is this documented how is the process

276
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
and the implementation is then on the on

277
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,279
the first level so which is the first

278
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,079
line

279
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,079
which is usually uh the tech departments

280
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
or the asset owners or the owners of the

281
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
applications

282
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
and we just need to check

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,200
over and over again so uh twice a year

284
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
of this is what the regulation requires

285
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
we have to review

286
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
accesses so the most critical more often

287
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
so like admin accesses we have to review

288
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
like twice a year

289
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,839
and um

290
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,160
this is very challenging also because if

291
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
you have like

292
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
is very fast growing so we have a lot of

293
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
assets also party providers cloud

294
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,800
services et cetera et cetera so it's

295
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
it's a challenge to

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
get this all together and

297
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
sometimes if you have a

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
architecture implemented at a certain

299
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,279
stage when you grow you need to

300
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
throw this over and maybe introduce

301
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
something more

302
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
professional more automated

303
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
and i think that's a that's a big

304
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
challenge

305
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,279
um

306
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,959
yeah i will say that

307
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,480
more or less

308
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,760
we also do

309
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
a combination of what has been discussed

310
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,079
right so like our approach here

311
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,360
um

312
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
or at least my my approaches to on one

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
side uh there is of course the

314
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
regulation part where you have okay look

315
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
there are certain things that you need

316
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
to do in my opinion identity manager in

317
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,959
general also for customer but especially

318
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,240
international company you need the

319
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,519
governance

320
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,680
so you need uh basically to establish

321
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
all the policies the framework all the

322
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
requirements and so on but then it also

323
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
gets to the actual implementation bottom

324
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
the customer side and um

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,480
and on the internal side on the cusp on

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
the customer side of course uh uh what

327
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
you already mentioned threat modeling

328
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
like design thinking or trying to look

329
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
into how is the authentication actually

330
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
working despite of the requirements and

331
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
are there any way to actually bypass the

332
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,279
authentication so we do this of course

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,920
with internal reviews uh with security

334
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,079
engineer we also do external uh

335
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,920
vulnerability assessment or penetration

336
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
tests or our platform on a regular basis

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
to try to one to cover as much as we can

338
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,959
uh to potential attacks we face

339
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,639
um

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
yeah and um i would say that's it

341
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
great thank you um

342
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,399
i think the next question i have is

343
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
around you know the all of the hype

344
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
around next gen authentication you know

345
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,399
for for the last couple decades everyone

346
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
in security has been

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,160
bemoaning the failures of the whole

348
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
username password thing but we haven't

349
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
really come up with a better way yet

350
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,399
that

351
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
is workable

352
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,839
um but i think now we're starting to get

353
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,440
especially with a lot of the the

354
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
different providers out there this whole

355
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
you know modern authentication

356
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
whatever adaptive mfa type ideas

357
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
my question is how much of that do you

358
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
use do you see it used with your

359
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
customer base and does it make them both

360
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,839
more secure and

361
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,399
easier to access the platforms or not

362
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
um yeah i mean i can only talk about how

363
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
we do kind of authentication i'm not

364
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
sure if it's next-gen or not there's

365
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,000
always a next-gen by the way i'm old

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,519
enough that there's been a next-gen

367
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,040
since i was 10.

368
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,079
um

369
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,920
i'm old um anyway so yeah so what we try

370
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
and do is um we use a lot of signing for

371
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,399
what we do and so again it's important

372
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,079
because we use this uh we're a mobile

373
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,639
first bank and so we use the properties

374
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
of the mobile device so the secure

375
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,199
enclave and things like this and so for

376
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,760
us what we try and do is um

377
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,720
sign

378
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
everything and sign everything and

379
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,240
especially anything important and didn't

380
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,639
do these challenges for this signature

381
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,040
um so for example if you come into

382
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
customer support well that's a signed uh

383
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
request into customer support so now we

384
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
know who you are and has been verified

385
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
because you're coming from your phone

386
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
uh that's already been through the kyc

387
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
process and so you you're you're that's

388
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
your second factor already there because

389
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
you logged into your phone and you

390
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
logged into our app so that's your old

391
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,560
username password and then we know who

392
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
you are automatically on that on that

393
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
method methodology also um

394
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,519
i'm about to say another banking term

395
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
how many know about psd2

396
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,880
all right yeah okay so uh we do the same

397
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
sort of thing to challenge psd2 so pst2

398
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,519
is this open banking thing right where

399
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,040
you're supposed to allow everyone to

400
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,079
come into

401
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
uh and use your accounts basically

402
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
you've got to open up your api to the

403
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
world um but the but

404
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
we rely on the the merchant are there

405
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
whatever the other person to do the

406
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,440
strong customer authentication so we

407
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
don't always trust that um because we

408
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
don't know that they're doing strong

409
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,839
customer authentication we might get to

410
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
this later um

411
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,720
yeah and so um and so there we can also

412
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,240
if we think it's suspicious if we think

413
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
something's weird we'll just send a

414
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,720
challenge right um so maybe you verified

415
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
with somebody else we'll still go ahead

416
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
and send a challenge if it seems like a

417
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,519
risky behavior and then you have to

418
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,040
answer with your phone your paired

419
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,199
device your second factor everything

420
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,360
like that so that's some of the ways

421
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
that we're using

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
kind of this sort of new technology

423
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
and leverage it to make it faster and

424
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
better

425
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,279
that's impressive

426
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,000
yeah well um i would say with

427
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
what we i completely agree with all of

428
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
you there so there are of course a lot

429
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
of next-gen uh we've been talking about

430
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,880
password list for a while right

431
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,639
and we've been trying to implement it

432
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,120
but we also see a lot of of constraints

433
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
with going ahead with with technologies

434
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
like that so most of the time when it

435
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
comes to real um

436
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,399
to rolling out in real life we are very

437
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
traditional

438
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
so of course um

439
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
we don't trust the password that's

440
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,639
that's not like the thing

441
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
anymore we have two-factor

442
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,160
authentication um and uh i think what

443
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
what we do at the moment traditionally

444
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,959
is to bind it to the phone

445
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
and as as travis has rightly said you

446
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,399
can have a lot of nuances you get from

447
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,440
the phone

448
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
uh that you can collect and and identify

449
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,120
say for instance if the app has been has

450
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,920
been tampered with and uh that's that's

451
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,880
basically how we can also detect it so

452
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,839
that's

453
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,040
that's my two sense here

454
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
um

455
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
yeah so from my perspective um i mean in

456
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,920
the context of passwordless no um if you

457
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,880
look at the strong customer

458
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
authentication password password right

459
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,279
now is considered the knowledge element

460
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
i mean there might be other knowledge

461
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,800
meant of course but uh

462
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
basically when you do uh in our case uh

463
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,199
like the mobile authentication for

464
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,599
fintech uh of course you you first asked

465
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
for a password then you are basically at

466
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
that point you pair a device where uh

467
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
you get for example the um

468
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,520
let's say in that case you have a

469
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,439
signature from the device and from that

470
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,919
moment on you can start uh interacting

471
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,760
with the customer that way of course

472
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,679
there is a third level uh which might be

473
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,520
the biometry and the link to the

474
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,119
transaction where when a customer is

475
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,200
doing a transaction you want to provide

476
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,120
the context basically as to authorize

477
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,679
based on um there has to be information

478
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,960
about what is transferring or not um

479
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
so

480
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
yeah in terms of uh next generation in

481
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,559
my opinion uh one of the issues with

482
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,960
most uh fintech of course like the main

483
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
problem is um

484
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,080
most of us don't have uh offices

485
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
so like for example when a psd was

486
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
started i forgot to activate psd to a

487
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,559
match podcast account and it was an

488
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,320
account i was not using so much after

489
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
seven months i said okay now i want to

490
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
use to locate a deal like back here i

491
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
had to go in as parker say office and

492
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
then they verified my id my password by

493
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,799
the way the photo was 10 years old so

494
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
who knows if they actually verified it

495
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,360
and then i finally got access i got

496
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
i went back with the 10 things or

497
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
something like that uh next time this

498
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
happens again i will lose it again so

499
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,640
um

500
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
in any case like the problem right now

501
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
with mobile banking is in my opinion

502
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
that on the authentication side there is

503
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,320
too much linking to sms to amtan

504
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,360
uh

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
which is something that in my opinion in

506
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
the long term has to disappear so

507
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
where basically like even when you use

508
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,919
device binding or you're pinning the

509
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
device to use a signature you still have

510
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,400
the main flow that starts with an sms so

511
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
in some cases where uh you could uh like

512
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
if you find a way to get to the sms

513
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,559
maybe compromising customer phone you

514
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
can initiate the entire flow pair a new

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,880
device in certain circumstances and and

516
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
that's something that of course needs to

517
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,640
be addressed in long-term terms in my

518
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,039
opinion

519
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,120
um yeah for the lifespan it's a bit

520
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,240
different because we are like on b2b to

521
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
see

522
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,520
company so we are not offering any

523
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,640
banking

524
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,440
applications directly but apis so for

525
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
example nuri

526
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
back-end connects to our back-end api so

527
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
there we do classical authentication

528
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
where all

529
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
two

530
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
and combine it also with the second

531
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
factor like whitelisting or of ips

532
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
um

533
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,799
so we are also

534
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
and and when it comes to end custom

535
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
authentication also the api we offer

536
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
this device finding

537
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,280
and

538
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,799
we ensure that

539
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
because this is who also applies to us

540
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
so we have to ensure that all our

541
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
partners follow this um

542
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
uh second factor authentication we also

543
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
always ensure that one the practice is

544
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,240
always

545
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,799
a large also that is device priming to

546
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,840
us or

547
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
uh sms through us

548
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
and um that's also very special about

549
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,679
our business model because we have the

550
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
banking license but we already doesn't

551
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
uh so we have to somehow check if newark

552
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
does a good job

553
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
so we require them to go to pentest or

554
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,919
we even

555
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,280
use blood checks for some of the

556
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,559
companies that order them so this is

557
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,080
a bit

558
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
special about our user product

559
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
and i think that actually

560
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
comes right into what travis was hinting

561
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
at before this whole topic of kind of

562
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,320
federated identity

563
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,720
which psd2 is a part

564
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,320
but you and solaris also

565
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,559
see yourself kind of driving a wider

566
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
federated identity between partners and

567
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,039
kind of like pushing the whole

568
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,320
fintech

569
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,918
scene forward in that realm

570
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,080
um

571
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,360
it's more

572
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
yeah difficult question i mean pst tool

573
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,559
is

574
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,400
the regulation is quite clear we have to

575
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
fulfill it

576
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
um

577
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
so i mean there there are some you know

578
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
visions of having like digital identity

579
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,559
at some point in the blockchain and

580
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,919
there's also initiatives driven by our

581
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,080
governments or even i think anger or

582
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
metal was driving this a couple of years

583
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
ago already but until there's like a

584
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,039
standard that is really commonly

585
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,080
acceptable and regulated i think it will

586
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,280
take

587
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
more time and at the moment we can only

588
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,000
do

589
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,159
uh what we have to do or we need to

590
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,440
comply to

591
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,799
so um

592
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,440
yeah that's how

593
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,119
[Music]

594
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,559
um

595
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,280
yes also like um

596
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
let's say talking not in terms of

597
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
regulation but what would be like in

598
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
general um like the evolution of it i

599
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
think there are multiple problems that

600
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
need to be addressed so for example

601
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
there are like projects like um aidas or

602
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
a digital identity you have a question

603
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,799
there do you actually want everybody

604
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,799
that has your uh to authenticate you

605
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
into novia api who you are after you uh

606
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
verified your identity and um

607
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
i'm personally more for a distributed

608
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,400
approach where i authenticate myself to

609
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
the bank but uh

610
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,919
for the specific use case but not that

611
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,600
there is like a distributed database

612
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,919
where my identity is being thrown around

613
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,799
uh

614
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,120
around the world yeah and um

615
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
it is um

616
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,159
but for sure like there are some some

617
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,760
systems that are actually using aidas

618
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
but banks are not really uh

619
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
implementing or adopting them right now

620
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
like for example there are very few

621
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,559
banks that allow to uh the

622
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,360
aid or address in germany also like in

623
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
italy there is um

624
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
it's called speed in italian let's say

625
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
it's a system using someone for

626
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
authentication macedonian are actually

627
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
using that but some banks are starting

628
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720
now to do that in france as well there

629
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
is a similar system it might be an

630
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,400
alternative uh still with the time

631
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,760
concerns but

632
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
uh more like in the direction of making

633
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
sure that people can just uh

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,520
iterate fast and you know reduce the

635
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
interaction or having to talk in a video

636
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
conference with somebody or in a video

637
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,760
course or

638
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,919
yeah i mean for me federated all has has

639
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,200
good and

640
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
near puzzle and minuses like everything

641
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,240
uh the pluses are um because pst2 means

642
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,320
we have to trust kind of anybody's

643
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,840
authentication um you know and i don't

644
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
trust well i don't trust any i'm

645
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,039
insecurity i don't trust anyone um and

646
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
so to have some sort of central

647
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,240
authority uh that is highly regulated

648
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,320
highly audited you know and and that

649
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,520
sort of stuff

650
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,039
it would almost but for me it almost

651
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,080
need to be and careful i know what i'm

652
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,919
saying that this special word here a

653
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,240
government authority because if you if

654
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,840
you did it within fintechs or if you did

655
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,120
it within banks i mean being that master

656
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,320
authenticator gives you access to all

657
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,720
the data's right of every customer of

658
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
every bank of all the transact if you

659
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
wanted to you know i mean it depends on

660
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
the scope obviously but then that that

661
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,559
makes that central person be very

662
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
powerful so if that's a

663
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
a deutsche bahn kind of thing then they

664
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,799
would that would be way that would be

665
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,960
very very unfair kind of like to to the

666
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
rest of the ecosystem kind of so

667
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
um

668
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
yeah so the the authenticate the

669
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,320
distributed model means you have to

670
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,919
trust a lot of people that you hope they

671
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,679
do a good job and yet like we did you

672
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,360
have to put in special controls to make

673
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,520
sure that you know even if they didn't

674
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
do a good job the customer is somewhat

675
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,279
protected because it's still your

676
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,960
responsibility their money's with your

677
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
bank

678
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,640
um

679
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
and then the centralized model might

680
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,880
have better security but then that's a

681
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
whole lot of power to put in one place

682
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,919
and then you also have the password

683
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
database kind of the issue where you

684
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,320
crack that place and um

685
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
good luck to everybody in the country

686
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
so yeah there's a there's a there's some

687
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,159
plus and minuses basically

688
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,799
i think i think that is also very very

689
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,880
risky and very dangerous for a larger

690
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
number of people especially if it's

691
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,559
coming from banking

692
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,279
and uh yeah identity and access

693
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,279
management even like when we think about

694
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,320
tools

695
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,559
i think this panel would

696
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,600
uh

697
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,919
would uh really

698
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,600
well talking today about about the

699
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,039
attacks that happened in identity and

700
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,880
access management if you talk about what

701
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,400
happened to octa

702
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
we can see the kind of impact right it

703
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,279
just rolls out to so many different

704
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,480
companies

705
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
and uh so even when we uh forget about

706
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
federated identity but even when we are

707
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
like looking at an identity provider we

708
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
can use in our environment there are so

709
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,919
many factors you need to

710
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,760
you need to think about

711
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,799
till probably their end of supply chain

712
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,919
so

713
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,919
yeah

714
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,760
i'd say maybe one more question for the

715
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,360
panel for me and then we'll open it up

716
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
to all of y'all

717
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,159
um maybe let's go a little bit more down

718
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,000
onto the technical side

719
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,559
how do you deal with um kind of the

720
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,760
scale of api authentication um and in

721
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
particular the problem that i'm thinking

722
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
about is

723
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,120
managing tokens tokens and sessions such

724
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
that you don't overwhelm your off server

725
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,760
with every single call to your bank

726
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,000
requiring a you know a separate auth but

727
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
then also making sure that you can

728
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,679
immediately de-provision a token if

729
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,440
someone logs out or if you recognize

730
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
something as compromised or anything so

731
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
how do you do that balance of session

732
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,840
management

733
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
um yeah for us

734
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,840
well we offer

735
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,240
as previously explained our apis to

736
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,840
other companies

737
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
and

738
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,039
we have that second factor so we write

739
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,960
list ips so we are

740
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
we can have a bit of longer sessions but

741
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,120
still we

742
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,400
we have a session timeout

743
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,360
that requires frequent renewal it's also

744
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,559
documented um api documentation so

745
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,200
whenever a new partner uh so we call our

746
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
customers partners whenever a new

747
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,600
partner like movie will onboard and want

748
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
to connect with

749
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
they have to read our

750
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,720
api specification and they can implement

751
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,559
against it so then

752
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,440
um

753
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
let's say we have a session timeout of

754
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,799
10 minutes and they need to send a

755
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,200
window like every 10 minutes and this is

756
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,120
shortly specified and um so far as it's

757
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,720
pretty easy because we set these

758
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
requirements and then

759
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,120
um

760
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,360
these requirements can be implemented

761
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,000
implemented by our partners i think the

762
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,480
challenge is more on the end user side

763
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,960
because they usually have a

764
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
smaller you want a smaller session

765
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,679
timers and there has to be a balance

766
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,200
between convenience and security

767
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
maybe

768
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
i mean in terms of uh

769
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,559
or scanning it depends i mean on the

770
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,279
customer side uh of course we're using

771
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,440
um let's say

772
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
uh backhanded are a little bit faster

773
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
for example radius for storing sessions

774
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
so that'll be that allows us to uh to

775
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
keep as much as we can in memory um

776
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,120
especially in case of where we are

777
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
spikes in traffic like in case of a

778
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
crypto company you have a another change

779
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
in the volatility of the time currency

780
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
and suddenly you get to like the 10 000

781
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
people more logging in one minute just

782
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
to check the price

783
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,840
so of course you need to to scale there

784
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,399
we don't have very much a distribution

785
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,320
model like our problem right now at

786
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,039
least on the customer side uh internally

787
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,679
like um like a synchronizing decision or

788
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,440
expiration session between application

789
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,399
i'm also

790
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
for the distributed approach there where

791
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,640
you basically have okay let's say the

792
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
company you have a central let's say

793
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,919
authority that this

794
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,480
let's say a federated entity that gives

795
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
the access to a certain application and

796
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,559
then the application managed to use a

797
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,360
session uh locally so that you actually

798
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
don't have to overload the centralized

799
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,840
system on an api level it depends i'm

800
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
also trying to use the distributed

801
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
approach so that means that

802
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,039
we have let's say hundreds of

803
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,080
microservices uh distributed in multiple

804
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,320
uh let's say uh

805
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,039
platform or cluster services and uh each

806
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,080
one has its own session storage uh when

807
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,000
it comes to for example to a solar span

808
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
backend or to another part of my

809
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,158
backhand um and so on

810
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,039
well i think um you've brought to light

811
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,200
a very good point so session management

812
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,080
can

813
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
uh like we've i've had these arguments

814
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120
with the product team a lot because uh

815
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,200
we're coming from where uh well of

816
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
course as part of security you need to

817
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,039
ensure you have a very good session

818
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,559
management in place you're following a

819
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,320
certain practice and then from a product

820
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
point of view you're like you're

821
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
actually just annoying the life out of

822
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
the out of the end customer so

823
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,559
yes we need to uh then i would say

824
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,679
when you need to speak with the product

825
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
owner to really understand

826
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,919
what is your end customer what is the

827
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,840
activity that they are doing

828
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,120
and what is the risk that we face out of

829
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,679
out of this and you know when we do the

830
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,600
threat modeling then we kind of consider

831
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,880
a little bit more um the architectural

832
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,159
differences and we would i would suggest

833
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,880
doing a tailor-made so depending on the

834
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,480
situation um and you you can create um

835
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,960
you you can set up your own periods of

836
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,399
session management that's just

837
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,440
yeah so um kind of like i was talking

838
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,360
about earlier we kind of work with

839
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
signatures a lot and so um

840
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,039
you know

841
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,640
obviously we use the oauth flow so you

842
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
have the long lived and the short-lived

843
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
token uh and so um so

844
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
i mean we found that very few people

845
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,559
actually in their mobile device

846
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
click to the settings and click log all

847
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,279
right and so they're actually kind of

848
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,720
always there and and so if it's a new

849
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,320
device you know if there's if there's

850
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,039
certain indicators of ip coming from

851
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,880
weird ips and you can obviously take

852
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
preventative measures but generally if

853
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
you're doing device signing that's much

854
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
faster less computationally intensive

855
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
than asymmetric right

856
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,640
you don't need so many calls back and

857
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,399
forth that sort of stuff and you start

858
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,840
and you still have

859
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,159
that kind of security as long as you

860
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,840
trust the device

861
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
now

862
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,399
we can go into a discussion if you want

863
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,880
to trust the device that much but so far

864
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
our account takeover numbers are super

865
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,039
low so i think we're working

866
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,080
um but yeah so and then um because i

867
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,640
mean at least we're cloud-based

868
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,720
you know the computational resources are

869
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
i haven't gotten to that argument yet

870
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
just quite yet uh we'll basically just

871
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
throw some horsepower at it if we needed

872
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,919
to

873
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
um now i guess we will open it up to

874
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,519
questions from the crowd

875
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,799
thanks guys

876
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,240
uh

877
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,120
i have a question serious one so over

878
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,760
the last three years of like hacking

879
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,440
fintech

880
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,760
i've noticed that

881
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,960
you guys

882
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,159
have

883
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
more responsibilities and less

884
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,720
options uh of like how we can affect the

885
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
process yeah so what's happening is like

886
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,840
over the last few years i see how

887
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,240
google points out visa saying hey this

888
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,600
is their fault this is how we

889
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,720
implemented things you guys from n26

890
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,799
pointed out on some vulnerabilities in

891
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,960
in apple touch id because you must rely

892
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
on that in your uh

893
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
signing features obviously alessandra is

894
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,320
fully dependent on the guys from solaris

895
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
bank and when i came to alessandra he

896
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,640
said hey guys this is not we can do

897
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
anything with that and just point it out

898
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,000
to the guys from solaris bank and that's

899
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,919
what i see over the last three years so

900
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,320
my question is do you guys on that side

901
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
of the fence feel the same like you

902
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,360
stuck between entities that require

903
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
something from you but from another side

904
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,679
you don't have like enough power to

905
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
affect the process or it's just in my

906
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,399
head

907
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,840
i mean um uh i have um a personal

908
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,760
interpretation of this

909
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,600
uh i mean i'm not german i'm an italian

910
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,279
but i've been in germany ten years and

911
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,279
my my my idea like one thing i noticed

912
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,279
when i moved to germany was the the

913
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,159
german the german government in general

914
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,880
tends to uh to have very strict rules

915
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
and they tend to renew these rules very

916
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,799
often and i think that's what happened

917
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,679
uh for example with mrs with buy team

918
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,200
but also like in general the european

919
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,279
level with the psd2 so what they said

920
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,880
they said okay look there are so many

921
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,399
banks that are doing this wrong let's

922
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,279
just do like buy tea it's basically i.t

923
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,960
requirements for banks yeah and if you

924
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
look at the the norm like three years

925
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,880
ago in my opinion it was innovative

926
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,480
because they say okay well something you

927
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,880
know something you own plus the

928
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,000
biometric where like many many companies

929
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,840
in private sector were not doing this so

930
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,120
the problem is that then the fast

931
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,039
forward a few years things starts to

932
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,000
become obsolete yeah and uh but but in

933
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
general of course you know where

934
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,119
something was innovative three years ago

935
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,520
like with overtime it's not the case

936
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
anymore and the same people who met

937
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,199
three years ago basically they're

938
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,320
probably not there anymore or uh it's

939
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,159
very difficult to basically come up with

940
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,440
uh very fast with uh improvements and of

941
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
course there are also like companies

942
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,159
like solarizebank or like everybody we

943
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,159
do certain investment into implementing

944
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,000
these things so you actually need to be

945
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
agile and tweeted it fast but the norm

946
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,719
actually doesn't change

947
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,918
so often as uh you like to have and we

948
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,719
are very very strict in my opinion uh

949
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,000
margin to improve things uh because if

950
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
we try to do something that is too

951
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,879
innovative

952
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,480
we will get under the regulator

953
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,280
voted high

954
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,440
yeah i just wanted to add

955
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
because you said

956
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
people are pointing at each other so i

957
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,079
think

958
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,200
as fintechs are growing usually very

959
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,359
fast and they have to be fast on the

960
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,320
market

961
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,560
so not everybody is implementing stuff

962
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,599
by themselves so we rely on other

963
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,920
third-party services we embed other

964
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
frameworks that are already out there

965
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
there's a lot of open source that is

966
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,960
used

967
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
and i think the challenge is to really

968
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,720
not

969
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,359
fully trust those things but really do a

970
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,800
proper assessment

971
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
and i mean

972
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,240
 mentioned octa i mean many

973
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,599
companies rely on it and now we saw um

974
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,599
they didn't really do well in this

975
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,320
situation so people might rethink they

976
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,960
really want to full rely on octo

977
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,280
maybe use somebody else for a second

978
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
factor or

979
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,359
you know not put full trust on one

980
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,320
uh one element or one third party

981
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,000
and um yeah i think that many of us

982
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
to to build a product fast to the market

983
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,440
you rely on our open source and you

984
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,400
rely on on providers that offer certain

985
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,200
security features

986
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,040
um so i would say yes

987
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,200
we have constraints all over the place

988
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,320
constantly um but a lot of it comes from

989
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,480
like probably most of you that work for

990
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,560
some sort of web company comes from the

991
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,720
product side you know i mean customers

992
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,599
want

993
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,200
all these a lot of these features they

994
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,119
want to make sure that we work with uh

995
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,880
you know apple pay and and all the

996
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,320
various other features out there and

997
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,520
then we have the government regulations

998
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,119
which is of course the psd2 sort of

999
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,599
stuff and then we have uh what he's

1000
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,880
talking about bit which for me bit is a

1001
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,680
27-page document that says nothing

1002
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
except for hey do stuff securely and

1003
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,520
we'll interpret it if you did it when we

1004
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,119
come to your door uh so so you know yeah

1005
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,359
auditing is quite is quite interesting

1006
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,320
here um in this yeah in this phase but

1007
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,839
yeah there's constraints

1008
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,320
constantly um and and we're also in a

1009
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,920
growth market i mean

1010
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
and so there's a lot of competition

1011
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,599
going on so that's why

1012
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,119
for for me we always try to do

1013
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,599
risk-based approaches uh example this

1014
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,599
psd2 thing um

1015
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,599
you know there's a there's a regulation

1016
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,040
around like if they if they make a

1017
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,440
transaction 50 euro or less then we take

1018
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
one action

1019
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
if it's if it's a hundred euro or more

1020
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,119
it's more if there's a re if that if we

1021
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,280
if we have that user as a risky credit

1022
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,960
score maybe then we'll take a different

1023
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,680
action and so for us there's a lot of

1024
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,359
internal logic on how you can um address

1025
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,440
the action at the point of time of that

1026
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,240
action um so that's kind of yeah that

1027
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,440
that's that's the way we look because we

1028
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
want to our end goal is always to

1029
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,359
protect the customer because they're the

1030
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,960
ones that are angry with you they're the

1031
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
ones that are going to go to boston and

1032
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
complain um and then that can cause you

1033
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,480
all sorts of trouble so yeah i yeah

1034
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,040
there's constraints constantly

1035
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
i'm not sure if that answered your

1036
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,680
question

1037
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,160
i'll try and uh also answer it from my

1038
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,000
perspective

1039
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,560
well what i can tell you is fintech is

1040
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,040
heavily regulated and we really want to

1041
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,920
do our best to ensure that we are

1042
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,760
meeting up with all of the security

1043
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
requirements because we we know how

1044
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,240
risky it is for the end customer right

1045
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,160
so um

1046
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,280
yes whatever is under our control you

1047
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,160
know in terms of processes um in terms

1048
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
of rolling out products as you said you

1049
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,640
know we try to make sure right from the

1050
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,280
scratch right from ideation in fact that

1051
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,000
we put security requirements into the

1052
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,280
product and embed it in and those areas

1053
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,520
i would say of course we have control

1054
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
and we make sure that that security is

1055
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,400
taken seriously when we work in fintech

1056
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,920
uh but

1057
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,560
out of our control is is things like

1058
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
partners and you know third party

1059
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,920
integrations that that we have to we

1060
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,240
have to use as part of trying to meet up

1061
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,119
with all the requirements of of making

1062
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,200
the business profitable as well and

1063
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,920
that's where i think baffin helps us

1064
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
because we have to do

1065
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,359
because we have to as part of of

1066
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,359
complying with baffin

1067
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,480
really ensure we do a thorough job with

1068
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,760
uh evaluating each third party before we

1069
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,359
onboard it so for instance um even octa

1070
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,839
yeah so when when you ta when you're on

1071
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,240
boarding a customer like octa you have

1072
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,359
to really ensure that before your before

1073
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,800
you have them on board you have

1074
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,839
considered all the risk elements and you

1075
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,000
have an assurance around each of it so

1076
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
yes it is difficult for us but

1077
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,079
well we are trying our best

1078
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,119
um

1079
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,400
so an

1080
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,200
entirely different question or

1081
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,720
i'm asking for a clarification here um

1082
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,760
you some of you mentioned uh eid and the

1083
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,800
uh

1084
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,000
the id card in germany and

1085
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,560
i still wonder why after 12 years we we

1086
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,280
are not seeing this you being used more

1087
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,079
in

1088
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,319
any area for for identifying people

1089
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,079
because it has been

1090
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,880
done

1091
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,480
for that there's

1092
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
hardly any security risks and i think

1093
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,000
someone someone mentioned that you don't

1094
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,920
trust it because then you would have a

1095
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,400
single entity in which would be the the

1096
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
german state

1097
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,440
and uh

1098
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,760
maybe you can explain this further why

1099
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
why you're not trusting it or why you're

1100
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,200
not using that

1101
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,040
well um so we do have teams that are

1102
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
kind of like looking at different ways

1103
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,160
we can do um

1104
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,079
we would use that in our kyc process

1105
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,200
right because

1106
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,960
like once you want to know the customer

1107
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,280
um you you have to uh you know use

1108
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
method methodologies to identify who

1109
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,839
they are um so while i you know we are

1110
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,599
looking at that but

1111
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,640
at n26 where we try to look at solutions

1112
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,920
that's the other thing that's kind of

1113
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,839
weird is um because we work in so many

1114
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
markets not just germany but france and

1115
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
italy and spain and well um that uh they

1116
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,280
all have their own regulations and so we

1117
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
were thinking about that but we were

1118
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
thinking about maybe using say your

1119
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,839
passport chip and maybe be able to scan

1120
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,119
your passport chip or something that's

1121
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,960
more kind of ubiquitous

1122
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,839
across the eu um but yeah i mean that's

1123
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,200
it's

1124
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,520
that's that's really not not a bad idea

1125
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,839
to be honest with you um to you to kind

1126
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,359
of look at that as well

1127
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,319
um

1128
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,560
we do use third party kyc providers um

1129
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,960
so we are kind of limited sometimes with

1130
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,359
with what they can also intake

1131
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,680
um yeah so that that would be my answer

1132
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,520
there but we are trying to look look

1133
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,680
ahead um because i'm certainly um

1134
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,480
kyc is is a heavily looked at portion

1135
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,640
from the boffin you would say right

1136
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,280
yeah and and aml and that sort of stuff

1137
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,040
so yeah

1138
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,480
we're trying we're getting there

1139
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,319
yeah so that was mostly a personal

1140
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,720
observation so i don't get that in the

1141
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,280
way so for me like the argument aida's

1142
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,560
uh or digital identity is uh uh for sure

1143
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,440
it can

1144
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,359
help customers uh

1145
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,599
verify faster yeah

1146
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,040
one of the problem in germany for

1147
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,599
example um i don't remember the exact

1148
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,400
data but i think uh until a few years

1149
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,240
ago it was not mandatory to have the

1150
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,960
chip enabled and actually i think 40 of

1151
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
the german people were required and

1152
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,160
would request an id card they actually

1153
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,400
requested the chip to be disabled

1154
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,119
and uh now it's enabled by default but

1155
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,640
you still have then the user has

1156
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,760
actually to

1157
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,839
uh to on board itself uh so basically

1158
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,040
like if you look

1159
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200
at the company that wants to

1160
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,440
invest in the integration of that and

1161
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,040
you look just at the what is the

1162
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,880
conversion rate that you can get okay

1163
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,800
how many customers are in berlin can

1164
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,040
actually on board with the tool after

1165
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,240
like we spend three months of

1166
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,680
implementation then you look at the real

1167
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,040
number you see oh and

1168
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,560
another problem is here for example if

1169
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,319
you look at the italian system that is

1170
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,480
based on a saml protocol and federation

1171
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,440
that's actually compatible with the ida

1172
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,240
specification but still for a company

1173
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,960
like entering six uh us or whatever you

1174
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
need to integrate with the italian

1175
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,280
system with the french system with the

1176
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,040
german system and uh you also so so it

1177
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,920
is uh possible but like the way this

1178
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,760
works is not really standardized or the

1179
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,680
overall cross hero

1180
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,839
so it's just difficult to implement and

1181
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,240
again kyc is the one of the most

1182
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,400
controlled areas from buffing i would

1183
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,839
say so

1184
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,800
your marching there is very very small

1185
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,359
yeah so

1186
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,000
i have worked in the past for a digital

1187
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,520
identity company called weary me

1188
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,800
yes so uh i think

1189
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,480
i agree with you alessandro it's

1190
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,599
actually not so easy to get the trust of

1191
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,640
of people to really use this digital

1192
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,440
identity with the government backing it

1193
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,160
uh because sometimes you they they trust

1194
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,000
they have fears about their privacy

1195
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,560
sometimes they have fears about what

1196
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,960
about the central organization or if it

1197
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
gets act

1198
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,119
and

1199
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,599
so yeah it it will take a long time if

1200
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,000
at all the government um

1201
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,079
you know tries to roll it out in a much

1202
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,319
more organized way and makes it stricter

1203
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,800
to use those kind of identification

1204
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
methods maybe it might work in the

1205
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,280
future but as of now yeah it will take a

1206
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,079
huge implementation from our side to uh

1207
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,640
to really

1208
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,119
embed those into our systems when we see

1209
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,680
that it's not really

1210
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,560
that accepted

1211
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,720
any other questions

1212
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
so um i wondered if you could talk a

1213
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
little bit about the history of the

1214
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,839
federated identity and the objections

1215
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,839
that like the existing pre-existing

1216
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,079
silos had to it because i'm seeing a

1217
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,240
kind of similarity potentially between

1218
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,200
that and

1219
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,599
where we are with messengers

1220
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,240
in with the dma space at the moment like

1221
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,079
you know they're siloed and they won't

1222
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,400
not want to stay that way but people are

1223
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,079
pushing governments pushing for

1224
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,599
federation so

1225
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,200
is there a similarity there or i'm

1226
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,839
imagining it

1227
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,000
because no one else will answer um

1228
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,920
well so um

1229
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,280
kind of could could you restate your

1230
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,440
question a little bit uh so that like i

1231
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,560
said when i was talking about the

1232
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,400
federated auth um

1233
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,640
it puts a gatekeeper in there right and

1234
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,319
so that so

1235
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,480
who will be that gatekeeper is is kind

1236
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,560
of my question to that

1237
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,119
so so i was thinking back about like who

1238
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,520
objected to open banking like who didn't

1239
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,200
want open banking to happen in the past

1240
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,720
oh um okay i can't speak to the

1241
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,079
regulatory and uh ongoings of psd2 uh i

1242
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,520
just comply

1243
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,160
uh so yeah

1244
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,319
um so how do you uh deal with the threat

1245
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,480
of the militias insider for example like

1246
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,040
what are their other like anomaly

1247
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,200
detections for like accessing a huge

1248
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,319
amount of clients like octagon bridge

1249
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,040
um so what's your take on this

1250
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,359
that's it i mean that's a huge topic

1251
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,599
right i mean insider threat at a bank is

1252
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,640
is

1253
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,359
a real deal um

1254
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,359
yeah so it depends on exactly what

1255
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,280
system you're talking about and this is

1256
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,760
part of where i rely on like um

1257
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,520
product security people over there and

1258
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,960
26.

1259
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
um

1260
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,760
but um yeah so everything needs to be

1261
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,000
threat modeled for its particular

1262
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,560
instance so we have a customer support

1263
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,440
um

1264
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,599
platform that we built in-house so yeah

1265
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,720
metrics on that uh vip list block list

1266
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,880
too many accesses within one hour you

1267
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,720
know there's just different reporting

1268
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,440
features both technical and operational

1269
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,200
that we would use but that's just for

1270
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,480
that um

1271
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,400
you know again someone talked here about

1272
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,440
how iem is very strictly controlled so

1273
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,280
yeah i've worked you know again i'm old

1274
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,119
so i haven't been in 26 my whole life

1275
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,160
and the i the the user onboarding all

1276
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,079
supporting user recertification not just

1277
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,559
for privileged users but every third

1278
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,359
party every application every database

1279
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,280
needs to go through user recertification

1280
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,040
for us every six months

1281
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,359
and so that that's that's how you start

1282
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,920
to get that idea um

1283
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,200
zeem or sim is is basically one of the

1284
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,040
new not new but in the last two or three

1285
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,520
years it's a big buzzword and and boffin

1286
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,119
and vit and for them in my old days azim

1287
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,960
used to be something that like took

1288
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,800
security metrics a little bit and kind

1289
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,599
of would

1290
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,599
plug it out now it's the magic answer

1291
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,079
box and so it needs to be plugged into

1292
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,440
everything

1293
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,240
you go to every business process owner

1294
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,480
who has supporting assets and you say

1295
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,920
what could go wrong with your supporting

1296
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,240
assets uh let me collect all the logs

1297
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,960
from your supporting assets itss

1298
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,520
and then let me go and put in a bunch of

1299
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,079
user alerts for that and and you just go

1300
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,960
through every process in your bank

1301
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,240
uh and do that sort of anomaly detection

1302
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,079
and so yeah insider threat is is a huge

1303
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,359
huge issue um yeah and it's a culture

1304
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,119
thing too because uh last thing i'll

1305
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,559
give it to you

1306
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,400
um it's a culture thing too because we

1307
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,680
have a lot of techies and a lot of

1308
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,520
techies and i used to work at soundcloud

1309
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,400
right

1310
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,680
and so

1311
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,119
inside a threaded soundcloud was like

1312
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,200
hey man what we all trust each other

1313
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
nothing new and so you have a lot of

1314
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,480
engineers and you have a lot of people

1315
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,040
that come from that that sort of mindset

1316
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,400
and then you come to the and you come

1317
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,079
into the bank and so now you have to

1318
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,119
kind of

1319
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,680
help work with everyone to say um

1320
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,000
look this this is serious we have entire

1321
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,839
criminal organizations that try to get

1322
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,880
people on the inside all the time um and

1323
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,160
it's not that we don't trust you it's

1324
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,000
not that we don't want a group hug and

1325
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,880
everything but we have customers to

1326
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
protect and one of my culture things is

1327
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,960
i'm i also said you know i also let

1328
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
everyone know 50 of our employees have

1329
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,240
n26 bank accounts so you're not just

1330
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,880
protecting our some ephemeral customer

1331
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,640
or some market share or whatever like

1332
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,160
that you're actually protecting your

1333
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,559
colleagues and so this is this is this

1334
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,720
is kind of how we address inside of that

1335
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,680
sorry i

1336
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,800
[Laughter]

1337
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,720
okay um

1338
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,480
well i mean for me we would have to

1339
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,240
discuss two hours just about that but

1340
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,319
it's more like the approach is the

1341
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,880
you need a security program yeah and you

1342
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,319
need to have a later security approach

1343
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,240
so securing multiple layers so for

1344
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,920
example internal application you need to

1345
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,800
have a reuse reconciliation you need to

1346
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,520
have less privilege for as principle

1347
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,400
segregation of duty all the trail into

1348
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,880
every internal tool uh you need to

1349
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
monitor this audit trail you need to the

1350
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,720
alerts on satellite event it means you

1351
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,559
have to sit down you need to say what is

1352
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,079
irrelevant to you because otherwise you

1353
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,599
will have a dashboard exploding with

1354
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,319
alerts uh then for access to production

1355
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,920
infrastructure for example you want to

1356
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,640
have things like short-lived tokens uh

1357
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,000
where you also need a four-eyes

1358
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
principle so there has to be an incident

1359
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,200
declared or a maintenance cycle

1360
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,359
somewhere in a dedicated system a second

1361
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,200
person that approves before the token is

1362
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,520
actually issued uh you want to have a

1363
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,839
good sdlc in place where you are

1364
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,440
actually deploying production system via

1365
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,839
pipelines where under normal sequesters

1366
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,160
nobody looks into any production system

1367
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,520
and you generate them to meet the

1368
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,160
letters with adapters code reviews with

1369
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,800
two reviewers where nobody can merge

1370
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,720
until anticipated rules are happening

1371
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,920
static code analysis um dynamical

1372
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,000
application security testing so it's a

1373
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,119
collection of everything and um

1374
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,280
unfortunately that's you're still not

1375
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,839
secure you just raise the bar

1376
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,720
so uh insider threat is a very good

1377
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,800
topic and it's it's really scary for

1378
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,240
fintech because

1379
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,119
uh yes we have and especially for what

1380
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,880
uh what the business that i am in in

1381
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,839
crypto right we have a huge risk that

1382
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,800
frau and uh of course people know that

1383
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,839
people with inside knowledge or or with

1384
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,839
you know they publicize themselves on

1385
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,319
linkedin and you know each person's each

1386
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,400
person's position and who could be

1387
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
who could have more information than the

1388
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,960
other so insider threat is like a very

1389
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,520
big deal for us and i see a couple of

1390
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,160
ways in which you can handle uh insider

1391
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,800
threat um number one of course the

1392
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,599
easiest way is the contract so you have

1393
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:06,480
very

1394
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,720
heavy requirements on the contracts

1395
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
depending on which role they're taking

1396
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,280
is it customer support is it is it the

1397
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,599
syste admin role or you know whatever

1398
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,520
role that you're taking in what kind of

1399
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,720
what kind of

1400
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,240
of detail should be put into the

1401
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,000
contract based on the risk that that

1402
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,119
role gives second thing is uh you need

1403
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,440
to have a very thorough

1404
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,079
knowledge of your system as as travis

1405
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,000
just said you have to understand how

1406
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,599
your processes work and how you uh what

1407
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,480
system

1408
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,760
connects to what who's working on what

1409
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,079
you need to know how to intelligently

1410
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,720
separate your systems so for that i

1411
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
always begin with a threat modeling yeah

1412
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,559
so you the threat modeling will give you

1413
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,079
a very clear picture of uh all the

1414
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,480
possible threats that you would have

1415
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,240
even from an insider point of view or

1416
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,280
from a service point of view and uh you

1417
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,119
have to take threat modeling output very

1418
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,520
seriously it is a very detailed process

1419
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,440
it's tiresome i guess i guess the

1420
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,000
security team gets exhausted doing it

1421
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,240
but as an output of it you kind of

1422
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,440
understand

1423
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,119
who even internally could be a threat uh

1424
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,559
to this environment that we're talking

1425
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,680
about

1426
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,240
the third thing is i would suggest is

1427
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,240
having a internal bug bounty program

1428
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,400
so what you would what the benefits of

1429
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,119
the internal bug bounty program is that

1430
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,680
you you kind of uh incentivize it you

1431
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,240
gamify it you say that you know we of

1432
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,000
course as part of being in this business

1433
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,720
want to make it very secure the security

1434
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,599
team is a layer above the real tech team

1435
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,400
so

1436
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,839
is it um is it possible for you guys to

1437
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,000
to hide to take that security role

1438
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,480
seriously and identify if not in your

1439
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,559
project don't don't embed it into your

1440
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,760
project but in any area that you find

1441
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,520
you know if there is if there is a low

1442
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,480
hanging fruit for say an insider or for

1443
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,880
from outside that we have not already

1444
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,559
considered as part of our security

1445
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,839
process please inform us and

1446
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,160
and we will we will provide you a bounty

1447
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,760
and the bounty is usually of course we

1448
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,079
don't uh i would suggest not

1449
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,079
putting in like cash bounties onto it

1450
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,000
but more like a team event so you

1451
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,079
celebrate that we have hardened our own

1452
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,400
environment and you know the hero from

1453
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,960
our team has basically found this aspect

1454
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,680
and and you celebrate it internally so

1455
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,160
internal bug bounty has brought to light

1456
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,720
a lot of issues um

1457
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,640
that we wouldn't have been able to find

1458
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,280
with even penetration testing uh so

1459
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,480
that's also one one uh area which i

1460
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,440
would suggest companies to use

1461
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,079
yeah those those and uh there are of

1462
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,480
course a lot more around audit that i

1463
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,160
could keep speaking about but i would

1464
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,839
please hand over to good okay

1465
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,280
thanks don't know if i have a lot more

1466
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,359
to add people are i think starving want

1467
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,000
to go for lunch so i i think everybody

1468
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,160
has been sad so i also think you need to

1469
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,200
really understand your business

1470
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,040
processes and that where i would start

1471
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,640
before you even do the threat modeling

1472
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,319
because you need to know what's going on

1473
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:13,760
in your business what information is

1474
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,079
processed and what assets you use and

1475
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,240
then you need to

1476
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,200
on a risk level um apply

1477
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,960
different security layers and you should

1478
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,960
always do multiple layers because one

1479
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,720
taking all this fail you need to have

1480
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,440
2fa you need to have monitoring um so

1481
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,119
for example we on our production

1482
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,720
environment we have

1483
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,640
we see every activity that is done by

1484
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,480
somebody who has access to production

1485
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,520
and we have to you know sign it off

1486
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,359
this is just one measure and then also

1487
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,839
of course awareness culture

1488
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,160
and um

1489
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,640
great i guess um if you have any more

1490
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
questions feel free to hit up all of the

1491
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,040
panelists during lunch and

1492
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,900
have a great rest of the day

1493
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,349
[Applause]
