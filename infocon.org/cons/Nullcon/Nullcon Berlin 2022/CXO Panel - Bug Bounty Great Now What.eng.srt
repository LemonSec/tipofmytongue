we have

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,640
i'll briefly introduce and then let you

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
guys introduce yourselves in

independent security researcher

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,280
all right so one second

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,399
hi everyone

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,440
i'm madeline i uh joined microsoft about

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
eight months ago prior to that i was

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,519
working over at hackerone

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,439
helping to run their vendor managed bug

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,200
bounty programs so i'm excited to be

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
here today and talk to you guys about my

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
experience at both hacker one and

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
microsoft and some of the differences

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
there

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
thank you i'm dominic at gitlab for a

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
little over two years and we have our

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,360
bug bounty program

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,439
managed by hackerone and

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
a bb particularity is that we have

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
mostly open source software so you can

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
look at our source code and this

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
makes an interesting dynamic with

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
researchers

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
yeah my name is thomas roth i'm probably

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,240
better known as stack smashing

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
and i come from the researcher side so

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
i'm the guy who submits to the buck

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
bounties and gets burnt all the time and

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
so it will be an interesting discussion

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
i think

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,040
i'm david caligaris i work for huawei

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
for five years i'm leading the team of

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
vulnerability research and also the back

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
bounty program so my team is doing

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
charging variant analysis and we use the

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
vulnerabilities receiving the bug bounty

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,880
program to improve this process

56
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,440
[Music]

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,239
all right so yeah bug bounty as you know

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,040
has moved from nation to mainstream

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
security testing process now

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,560
it's

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
killing our business too because we are

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
a print testing company

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
but anyways yeah now if you see a lot of

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
uh companies from different domains we

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,920
talk about healthcare automotive

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
financial

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
all of them have some sort of

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
program so

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,200
with this panel what we're going to do

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,319
is

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
we're going to talk beyond starting a

73
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,879
vulnerability program specifically in

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
terms of

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,200
how do we

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
optimize returns on bug bounty practices

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
to effectively incentivize and reward

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
researchers

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
nice

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
focus and prioritize targets

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
maintain testing engagements with the

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,959
security community so with that

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
let's start with the first question

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,680
all right beyond launching how do you

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
develop

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,319
the the community

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,879
i can start that

88
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,760
uh

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
so with our bug bounty program a lot

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
like how a lot of the company

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,200
works at get lab we think that

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
our transparency is what helps

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
moving forward with researchers we don't

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
we don't have too many secret practices

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
or whatever our process on how our

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
engineers triage bugs is public and i

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
mean if someone doesn't like it they can

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,519
even open a merge request to change it

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
it's truly transparent and public we

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
disclose the security issues

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,080
and as i said we're an open source

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
company so you can look at the code you

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
can look at how previous vulnerabilities

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
were fixed so this sort of stuff really

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
builds a little community around that

106
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
they get to know get kind of to feel

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
like they're almost part of the company

108
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
because they get to see the discussions

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
that have happened around their bugs so

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
beyond

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
the incentives beyond the challenges or

112
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
the contests we can build uh the

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
transparency around the entire

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,680
development process helps

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
incentivize people to just stay around

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,918
and be part of the whole thing and i

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,440
think it's very

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
motivating for

119
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,680
many of our top hackers

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
i know i'm going to get some spice

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
so as i mentioned coming from hacker one

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,199
definitely using a vendor based program

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,479
is going to be different because there's

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,320
a captive audience there within that

125
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,360
community

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
so

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
as dominic had said there's a lot of

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
really great uh tools that you can use

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
to build a community like within hacker

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,440
one

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
moving over to microsoft it's a little

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
bit of a different

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
set of researchers and one of the things

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
that we've really focused on is that we

135
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
don't just have a microsoft research

136
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,240
community but rather we have a global

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
researcher community we're always

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
looking to have anyone and everyone

139
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
submit to us no matter their region

140
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,240
um

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
and so something that we've been working

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
on is making it more accessible

143
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
um so beyond just our mbr program and

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
some of the outreaches that we're doing

145
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,199
we are looking at revamping um quarterly

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
leaderboards we're

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
starting up uh badges digital badges so

148
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
that our researchers can probably go on

149
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,759
their twitter or their linkedin and

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,520
promote the fact that they are a high

151
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
accuracy researcher within microsoft and

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
then also looking at some development

153
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
paths for researchers when they do come

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,680
in if for example if they

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
happen to focus in a specific area what

156
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,039
does it look like then bringing that

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
researcher on for a grant or for a

158
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
private challenge and then developing

159
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
more opportunities for them within the

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
space

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,840
yeah i think that's the you mentioned

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,400
the rewards program and so maybe a bit

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,440
of a of a story on community building so

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
um i get invited to a lot of buck

165
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,479
pontius and i get a lot of emails like

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
hey do you want to join our researcher

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
program do you want to join xyz

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
one of the problems is that i get an

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
initial mail i get an invitation to the

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,919
program

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
and i think that's that's the only point

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
in time where the program exists because

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
afterwards i never hear of it again i

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,840
never get an email again for example in

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
the context of microsoft i i know it's

176
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
changing

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
i got invited to this researcher rewards

178
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,039
program

179
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,680
and then i got access to msdn that

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
expired i

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,039
tried to reach out again hey guys do you

182
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,720
still do this is this program still

183
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,639
alive and i just got you know like sorry

184
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
i moved departments i'm not sure who you

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
should ask i couldn't find anything on

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
the internet and i felt like

187
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
where's that community i controlled

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
about but i guess that's changing now uh

189
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
so i'm excited about that

190
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
thomas i'm so glad that you brought that

191
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
up

192
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
um for anyone who is looking for

193
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
information or for support from our

194
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
researcher community definitely reach

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
out to bounty microsoft.com we are happy

196
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
to help support you and make sure that

197
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
you get routed to the appropriate teams

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,199
so

199
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
thomas can i expect to get an email from

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,800
you

201
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,690
[Laughter]

202
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
from my side what i can say to engage

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
researchers is helping them to set up

204
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
the target so maybe

205
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
despite my colleagues here they

206
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,919
analyst my produce finalist here they

207
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,680
run a back bounty program on public

208
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
website instead i'm running a back

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
bounty program on a device and starting

210
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,319
on a new device means a lot of cost

211
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,840
because you need to create your own

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
device on your debug environment to find

213
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,759
bugs and so on

214
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
so helping researcher to have access to

215
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,319
expensive device this is something that

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
can be helpful or provide him

217
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
instructions how to debug some aspects

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,759
inside the mobile phone or whatever

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
or for example with some trusted

220
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,160
researchers that they submit via history

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,960
they submit bugs to us and so on we can

222
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
give them devices that are in beta and

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
then since the products are in beta

224
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,759
maybe it's more easy to find bugs and

225
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,360
the experience becomes also more

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
reminiscent

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
yeah i think that's a great point and

228
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,639
even

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,720
us at gitlab even if it's open source i

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
think many people here will have cloned

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,640
an open source repository and had no

232
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,360
clue how to build the application so so

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
we also have all our development

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
processes are public and we also have

235
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
docker images if they just want to run

236
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,880
everything so really just making it easy

237
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
to get started because

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
there are so many other programs that

239
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
are probably easy to get started so if

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,640
you have like a three hour three day

241
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
ramp up to just figure out your

242
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
environment you might lose a researcher

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
to another target that's more fun to

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,279
work on so

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,560
really just

246
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
make it easy if you if you wake up in

247
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
the morning hey i feel like hacking on

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,560
gitlab it should be easy to be doing

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
that within a reasonable amount of time

250
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,959
and not just setting up endlessly

251
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,399
all right

252
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
now for the next question please give me

253
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,800
some you know disagreements and

254
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
controversies please

255
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,519
how do you handle conflicts so i'll

256
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,480
start with

257
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,959
madeleine

258
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
um so i was actually chatting earlier

259
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,680
today with some folks and we all agreed

260
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
that

261
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
conflicts are sometimes one of the most

262
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
interesting parts of our job and it

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,360
gives us an opportunity to choose to

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,600
respond rather than react that means

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
seeking to understand what is motivating

266
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,120
the researcher to behave in this way

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
what is motivating the researcher to

268
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
continue to reach out once a buck has

269
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
been closed for example as

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
you know not a vulnerability is there

271
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,440
some credence here to to that claim and

272
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
so when handling conflict i think it's

273
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
really important that

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
you do have that moment of let's

275
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,279
understand where this person is coming

276
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
from rather than going straight for the

277
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
band button as i like to call it and my

278
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
perspective on this definitely did shift

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,480
when moving from hacker one over to

280
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
microsoft microsoft has a no band policy

281
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
and what i have found is that even if

282
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
it's you know one interaction to six

283
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,839
months worth of interactions eventually

284
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,079
we do get to a place where um both

285
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
microsoft and the researcher are able to

286
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
work effectively together and we never

287
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
actually want to shut that door to

288
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,519
collaboration because the moment that

289
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,360
you do ban someone is the moment that

290
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
you lose them forever and it is an

291
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,160
impact to like your customers

292
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
yeah so to

293
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,480
sorry about that uh

294
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,160
conflicts

295
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
we don't have a no ban policy however uh

296
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
i haven't seen too many of those in my

297
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,959
couple of years so that's that's a good

298
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
sign that we have positive interactions

299
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
mostly

300
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
uh it's really about discussions and

301
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,279
also

302
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,279
i think that's something that we can

303
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
realize when you you work at a company

304
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
with a bunch of people with a global

305
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,519
background but sometimes in the written

306
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,160
text interaction in the language that is

307
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
my second and quite possibly a third or

308
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
fourth of the person i'm talking with

309
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
some stuff gets us in translation and

310
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
you're like wow this person is so rude

311
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
no it's just how they could explain what

312
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
they're trying to say i probably come

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
off through once in a while so you just

314
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
keep that in the back of your mind and

315
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
say okay let's just

316
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
read what was said with

317
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
the facts that are in the sentence and

318
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,399
let's not try to put an emotion behind

319
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
the sentence but sometimes

320
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,600
it gets

321
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,720
like

322
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
objectively rude

323
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
there's no it's not an interpretation

324
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
this is difficult

325
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,760
we will

326
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,480
we

327
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
we amended our policy to mention that uh

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
basically well as i mentioned we host

329
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,680
our program on hacker one so we

330
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
the hacker one code of conduct applies

331
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
and there are

332
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,920
bannable offenses on hacker one that

333
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,839
that apply if someone is just

334
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,360
outrageously offensive to people or just

335
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,920
resorts to racism or whatever

336
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,800
but

337
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
still we'll try to have like a warning

338
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,040
just say

339
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,720
we can sort this out if we we talk but

340
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,720
if it stays really animated we

341
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
we will just

342
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
try to uh

343
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
we will we will solicit the help from

344
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,519
the the hacker one platform who who

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,200
triages and also it's it's part of the

346
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
of the advantage from a company side to

347
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,839
have these people help us disarm

348
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,680
conflicts and and not

349
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
get too personal with the

350
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
with the person like

351
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,120
not not get into personal attacks or

352
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
anything just have a a barrier between

353
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
to disarm the conflict

354
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
finally coincidentally enough i right

355
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,680
now i have a conflict with gitlab

356
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,839
which

357
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,560
say how how do you feel about the the

358
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
overall process at hack one like sorry

359
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
so i submit

360
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
my buck that i'm not gonna go into

361
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,200
detail about um then i get a message

362
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
from

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
a golden retriever literally um like

364
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
that's like a picture of a dog yeah yeah

365
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,120
for context there's a person on hacker

366
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,760
one who does triage and he's he this

367
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
person is not a a git lab team member

368
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
but they work for hacker one and kind of

369
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,959
to

370
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
not have a name on it it's golden

371
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,560
retriever

372
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,440
right and so um which which already has

373
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,959
very negative wording towards the

374
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,000
researcher

375
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,399
they were the words doubt in their hands

376
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,959
on a very strange wording and then a day

377
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,560
later it gets close to us and formal

378
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,839
without a real

379
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
mitigation path without clearance like

380
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
why is this informal because you know i

381
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,839
compromised the customer using this i'm

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,800
still compromising someone using it

383
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
yeah it's the is the difficulty with

384
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
having

385
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
external people manage the triage for

386
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
your application in many cases in most

387
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,160
cases i would say they get it right they

388
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
it it's either like they either get it

389
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,399
right that it was indeed a bug or to get

390
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
it right that it was not a bug i don't

391
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
think their error rate is any worse than

392
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,600
what it was when we handled it however

393
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
uh it is more difficult from a hacker

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
side i think to to reach to the company

395
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
and say hey i'm sorry you made a mistake

396
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
here this is why

397
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,480
at get lab we basically the entire feed

398
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,199
of

399
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,560
report that comes from hacker one is

400
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
also posted in an internal slack channel

401
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,839
and we have many people

402
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,760
looking at it and keeping an eye on the

403
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,040
things that

404
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
that look wrong basically like if if

405
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
someone comes back and sends a question

406
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,240
there's

407
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
at least it's at least worth

408
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
reading what what's their concern we're

409
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,279
not like

410
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,040
heck one will handle it

411
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
so so that's how we

412
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,880
we tried to resolve this and

413
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
i've been made aware that someone saw

414
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,030
your comment and it's being worked on

415
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,279
[Laughter]

416
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
that's good to you yeah how do you i'm

417
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
kind of curious how do you handle um i

418
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,199
guess on twitter the hottest topic is

419
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,920
like monetary conflicts how do you do

420
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,519
your all deal with like

421
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,760
this like you say it's a 500 buck the

422
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,199
research is no no it's a 500 000 but how

423
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,760
do you deal with that

424
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,360
um first of all in my opinion conflicts

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
starts from expectation so sometimes you

426
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,800
have a guy submitting a vulnerability at

427
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
12 o'clock and then at one o'clock is

428
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,639
where is my trier

429
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,279
it's one hour and then maybe don't

430
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,279
understand the priorities that we give

431
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,800
about the vulnerability internally

432
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
because we don't have only maybe the

433
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
vulnerability of this guy so the guy

434
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,720
maybe is pretending our reply in 24

435
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,560
hours that maybe could be an automatic

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,320
we take care of your case and we will

437
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,279
proceed

438
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
then the vulnerability based on the

439
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
impact and so on is getting triage in a

440
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
reasonable amount of time

441
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
but

442
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
sometimes some researchers like write

443
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,440
every day to ask any update on my

444
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
vulnerability any update on my

445
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,399
vulnerability and that

446
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
could be a reason of conflict

447
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
about the value of the vulnerability i'm

448
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,680
a little bit old school and i say let's

449
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
the code speak

450
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
so if you say that the vulnerability of

451
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
eige impact provide a better poke and we

452
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
will provide even additional money if

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
you provide with a poke that we are

454
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,560
wrong

455
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,959
this is in my opinion we are living in a

456
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,440
society based on science and technology

457
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
and let's evidence

458
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
sustain our claims this is in my opinion

459
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,480
the most fair thing that we can have in

460
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
proving the thing of course we are aware

461
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
that writing a book and writing a full

462
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
exploit for the vulnerability is a

463
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,320
question of time investment and so on

464
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,199
but

465
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,079
i mean

466
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,480
we don't maybe pretend the

467
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
full working exploit but show that you

468
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
can control a resistor or whatever that

469
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
could trigger to a primitive and great

470
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
right or whatever of course we change

471
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
our mind so

472
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,039
we are when you have new evidence you

473
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,480
can change your opinion this is

474
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
something that in my opinion is

475
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,410
[Music]

476
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,799
important think that managing

477
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,959
expectations is a great place to start

478
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,720
and something that we do at microsoft is

479
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
we stick to our bounty amounts that we

480
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,679
publish there are no

481
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,039
expectation exceptions there's no

482
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
bonuses um and

483
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,799
we don't do um kind of like evaluation

484
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,320
based off of

485
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
yeah but this had really big impact if

486
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,440
it's out of scope it's not a scope but

487
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,679
if it's in scope it's in scope and while

488
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,400
that might seem harsh or like we

489
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
don't care about the research that you

490
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
are submitting it's done in that way so

491
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
that each and every researcher has a

492
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
consistent and fair experience with

493
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
microsoft

494
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,559
and i think that another thing that

495
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,840
we've touched on earlier in our

496
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
discussions is that bug bounty is not

497
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,960
necessarily a pay for everything it's a

498
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
tool that we use strategically on top of

499
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
all of our other security tools and

500
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,280
there needs to be an associated roi on

501
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
it so

502
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
our scope is set for his very specific

503
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
reason and our researchers that do

504
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,559
participate in bug bounty are helping us

505
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,440
to achieve a goal which is to understand

506
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
our attack surface gather data and then

507
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
go back and then make broad mitigations

508
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
that then help to reduce that risk for

509
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,160
our customers and so that's why we do

510
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,320
have transparent updates and a change

511
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,200
log and everything published on our um

512
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
on our pages so that when there are

513
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
bounding disputes we're able to go and

514
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
reference that and each and every

515
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
researcher can expect that consistent

516
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
experience

517
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,200
yeah it's a good point with the

518
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,360
expectations i think once again it's a

519
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
place where transparency helps a lot and

520
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,960
if

521
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
you are upfront with what you pay how

522
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,880
you pay

523
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,559
like how long you're going to take to

524
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,960
pay what what what does the researcher

525
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,039
need to submit to get the money and just

526
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,160
really

527
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
leave no questions unanswered that that

528
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,799
solves a lot of conflicts i

529
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,960
and when you you have a

530
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,000
we tie the money to cvss score and which

531
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,919
in itself is slightly controversial in

532
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,760
some circles but

533
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
but at least

534
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
people know ahead of time and we have a

535
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
calculator that we use to map the score

536
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
to money and we test calculator is

537
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
public and inside the calculator like if

538
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,679
uh

539
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,679
at that complexity high low and all that

540
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,400
stuff in our calculator we show like

541
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
what criteria do we use to decide this

542
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
situation is high the situation is low

543
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,799
so

544
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,320
disagreements can

545
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
can exist that's for sure and once again

546
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
this is all open source if you disagree

547
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
you can help us change the calculator

548
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,679
but

549
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,280
you know ahead of time you can even

550
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
basically calculate your bounty and and

551
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,039
then

552
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,360
we can have this discussion if if you

553
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
disagree and it it happens and sometimes

554
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
we don't change but sometimes we change

555
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,880
if the the argument is is interesting

556
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,919
so

557
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
so yeah expectations making this clear

558
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
and also when the question comes in it

559
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
means something wasn't clear so if you

560
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,520
can address that by

561
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,679
adding documentation making the policy

562
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
clear or whatever way of communication

563
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,320
you use just to make sure this question

564
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
doesn't come up again so the next

565
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
researchers can benefit from that

566
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
all right so

567
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
one of the thing is

568
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,679
researchers based in countries where you

569
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,559
have restrictions of payments so how how

570
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,559
do you handle that like paying a

571
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,399
researcher in a specific country

572
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
so um obviously we cannot pay out

573
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
researchers in sanctioned countries

574
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
but we do welcome

575
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,640
any researcher to submit through ethical

576
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
or responsible disclosure and we're

577
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
happy to take a look at those reports

578
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,039
and we appreciate any activity that

579
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,200
the hacker community can provide to help

580
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
protect microsoft users

581
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
and when it comes to payments we stick

582
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,600
to law on that but

583
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
we use a few different payment vendors

584
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,159
so we use hacker one and bug crowd

585
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,679
to help facilitate those payments as

586
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:19,850
well

587
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,799
[Music]

588
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,799
yeah it's a bit of a

589
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,720
cup out answer i guess but since we use

590
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,799
a platform we we just follow whatever

591
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,919
the platform will pay i mean we we never

592
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,640
look at the person's

593
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,039
location nationally or whatever and

594
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
if if the platform will pay there we'll

595
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,000
be glad to send the money and yeah

596
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,159
basically it's handled at the platform

597
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,240
level for us because we don't completely

598
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
run it independently

599
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,039
so basically when someone submits a

600
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
vulnerability we don't know the identity

601
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
of this person because for gdpr this is

602
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,240
in our backbone partner that is

603
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,880
zerocopter is a european company similar

604
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,159
to rocker one

605
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,720
and basically the company is following

606
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
the laws of european union so if

607
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
something for european union is not

608
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
allowed i don't know transfer in some

609
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,159
formats and so on we stick to what the

610
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,480
our back boundary partner is doing in

611
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,159
this case so we are not handling our

612
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,240
finding directly and we follow european

613
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,039
law

614
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
this is also means that

615
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,520
when you submit cabinet to our back

616
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
bounty program you need to go to a

617
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,280
process that certifies that you are a

618
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
person that is not

619
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,440
into money laundry operations and so on

620
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,760
so they have always called it a

621
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
clearance check of the person that is a

622
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
trustful person and so on so

623
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,159
basically here you need to follow the

624
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,280
load and this thing and you cannot pay

625
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
so we have also discussing about

626
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
conflicts before you have some

627
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
researchers that say oh send my money on

628
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,320
paypal

629
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,919
no you need to register in the platform

630
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,760
you need to be a real person and so on

631
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
so this is also a cause of conflict

632
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
sometimes but you need to explain to the

633
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
researchers that you are a corporation

634
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
and you cannot bypass process and do the

635
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,240
simple payment on paypal or poster pay

636
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,799
or defense on the payment but you need

637
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,080
to follow some rules that otherwise is

638
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,720
going crazy

639
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,690
i i don't pay bounties so i

640
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,710
[Laughter]

641
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,320
don't all right so

642
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,039
so all of you are saying that except for

643
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,559
him obviously

644
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,520
uh that you'll rely on um

645
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
on on the third party like whoever is

646
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,679
your payment vendor

647
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,880
or bounty vendor right so theoretically

648
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,440
let's say if

649
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,039
that vendor falls under certain

650
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,880
legal laws where they are restricted to

651
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,240
make payments

652
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
do you see that as a threat in terms of

653
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
uh the researchers then not

654
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,559
submitting to the platforms or to you

655
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
and going in the black market

656
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,640
what a good question um i'm gonna answer

657
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,960
this as diplomatically as i can

658
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,400
without getting yelled at on monday

659
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,440
morning

660
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
um

661
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,640
so

662
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
like i said we will if there are

663
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,679
currently no sanctions um pertaining to

664
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,679
administering back money bug bounty

665
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,960
payments then uh microsoft will then pay

666
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
that researcher so we do have a

667
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,640
microsoft payment option

668
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,600
um regardless of what um our other

669
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,159
payment vendors bug crowd or hacker one

670
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,600
might choose to do with regard to

671
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,039
those

672
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,360
individuals and specific countries where

673
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,479
there might be some gray area

674
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,279
i

675
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,799
i think

676
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,120
maybe it's naive or wishful thinking but

677
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
i think among the bug bounty community

678
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,039
the people

679
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
who are like if i can't get my bounty

680
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,679
then i go to the black market is

681
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,440
a fairly minimal number of people and

682
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
those people were already likely to go

683
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,080
to the black market anyway

684
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
so i think i mean does it increase that

685
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,520
risk probably but by how much i don't

686
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
think it's like a new threat we have to

687
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,360
deal with i think

688
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,919
the black market threat is real and

689
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,880
exists

690
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
regardless of any existing sanctions and

691
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
i yeah i don't think it's

692
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,480
raised by a substantial amount let's say

693
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
it's like that

694
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,360
so if you decide to uh

695
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,799
if you let's say that we get in a

696
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,159
conflict and you don't want you are not

697
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,080
willing to register on our back bounty

698
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,400
platform one thing that we offer is

699
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
donation to charity so we have a list of

700
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,559
charities that if you don't want to take

701
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,559
the bounty you can donate your money to

702
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,200
that so this is done by zerocopter all

703
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,279
the time but there is these options that

704
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,799
is

705
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,240
you have this option to donate to

706
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,400
charities and so on

707
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,279
that i think is a good thing

708
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,640
something interesting that came before

709
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
we were discussing this topic too is a

710
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,799
reminder that um

711
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,080
there are more incentives than just

712
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
financial incentives um there's

713
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
different ways that

714
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,799
programs can work with the research

715
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,039
community to reward them and that looks

716
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
like for example our mbr program which

717
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
thomas is a part of

718
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
i don't know

719
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,440
i can confirm

720
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,240
um

721
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,919
but also the different types of

722
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,400
engagements that we do with researchers

723
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
for example supporting any publications

724
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
or any type of

725
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,159
any type of talks that they want to do

726
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,760
so there are different ways that we are

727
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
able to reward researchers that might

728
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,600
not be eligible for bounty payments

729
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,799
right now

730
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,799
i think it's a good motivation sometimes

731
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,279
like i uh i knew that the uk government

732
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,960
sends you this wonderful challenge coin

733
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,480
if you find something in their system so

734
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,880
i went out to hack them just to get the

735
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,559
challenge point i think there are good

736
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,320
ways that are like even if you don't

737
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
have the capital to save money to to pay

738
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,200
money you you still can like if you do

739
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,039
cool stuff people might still be

740
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,000
friendly towards you

741
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
right

742
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,880
this is slightly out of context but are

743
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,760
you

744
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,520
are you or any companies you know

745
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,559
looking at crypto as uh payment options

746
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,520
for researchers

747
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
i believe that hacker one offers um

748
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,200
if you wanted to get paid on bitcoin or

749
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,559
different options so um there are some

750
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,240
uh platforms that do actually provide

751
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
that already

752
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
yes we pay through hacker one they

753
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
support payment through coinbase only

754
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,120
but with coinbase they have bitcoin and

755
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,840
usdc payments i know a lot of people in

756
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
the hacker community would like them to

757
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
support more than just coinbase but it's

758
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
a start

759
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,760
surely we'll see more in the future

760
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,159
zerocopter is offering bitcoin payment

761
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,120
advertising

762
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,960
we trust for the payments it's totally

763
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,559
transparent to the partner that we

764
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,640
choose for the backbone to program

765
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,559
who also so then we don't really have to

766
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,080
worry about sanctions then in the future

767
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,159
the problem is this will not

768
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,919
solve all of these issues right you

769
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,399
still have very quick kyc and so on so

770
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,000
it's like so

771
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,240
yeah

772
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,159
i mean you need to start despite you

773
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,679
have the payment on crypto you need

774
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,840
still to be a physical person that is

775
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,000
recognizable as a

776
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,159
legitimate person to receive money so

777
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,600
you cannot

778
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
we cannot send a money to somebody that

779
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,919
is not existing with a fake name so you

780
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,480
need to go to a verification process in

781
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
the zero copter platform so that i think

782
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
is very important to be super legal and

783
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,840
transparent in these things

784
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
cool

785
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,399
and

786
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,520
in

787
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,919
you mentioned uh regarding hardware uh

788
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,840
bounties specifically

789
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
uh i know

790
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,960
it's a different challenge to overcome

791
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
when it comes to bug bounties for

792
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
hardware because it's not the same as

793
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
software or something that you can do

794
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,159
online

795
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,559
but overall

796
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,039
what would you do

797
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,039
to match you know what do you do for

798
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,320
matching skill sets of researchers with

799
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,039
the

800
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
with the scope

801
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,640
and your targets

802
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,730
so

803
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,960
[Music]

804
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,600
of course the setup of doing a web back

805
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,360
bounty is taking your pc and try to hack

806
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
the website if you want to do a back

807
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,200
boundary on a mobile phone you need a

808
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,279
list to buy a device you can buy low

809
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,679
land devices or high-end devices and the

810
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,960
price can go from 500 to 1000 maybe in

811
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,120
the process of finding a buck you break

812
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
some devices we are totally aware that

813
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
this can happen

814
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
uh depends on the relationship that you

815
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,240
create with the researcher if the

816
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
researchers provide useful bugs in very

817
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
in the basement or in the other parts of

818
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,240
the

819
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,679
device

820
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,840
we can provide devices to the developer

821
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,679
to the researcher because we know that

822
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,440
he's a trustworthy person that we work

823
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,760
with some neat devices and maybe we have

824
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
a new product coming on the market we

825
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,000
gave him the product in advance of

826
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
course maybe we can have additional mdas

827
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,799
or whatever but it's a question of

828
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,080
creating a relationship with the

829
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,360
researcher

830
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,039
our bounty

831
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,440
offers high rewards with one million

832
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,039
euro so

833
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,640
i think that

834
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
if you provide good research we can

835
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,880
provide other great bounty for that

836
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
it's an interesting point with hardware

837
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,080
black bounties because like let's say

838
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
you you find a vulnerability and like a

839
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,000
harder vulnerability in the phone they

840
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
often only pay to like three thousand

841
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
dollars but the phone you know cost one

842
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
thousand you break one it's not two

843
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,799
thousand so

844
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,320
it's very difficult to get like a

845
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,640
positive return on investment if you

846
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,200
like do bug money for a living let's say

847
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,360
um it's yeah it's an interesting problem

848
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
that i haven't seen being sold nicely

849
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,960
but i guess they're now starting

850
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,080
to do some initiatives

851
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,550
you want to join our website

852
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,070
[Laughter]

853
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
all right so even in general for for uh

854
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,279
software uh

855
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,039
bug bounties how do you

856
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
nurture the researcher in terms of

857
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,200
matching their skill sets with the with

858
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,240
the scope on the target

859
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,600
so when i was with hacker one i made it

860
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,080
a priority to at each live hacking event

861
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,880
get to know a handful of researchers and

862
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,559
then work with those researchers to

863
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,960
ensure that i was pairing them with the

864
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
right scope and the right programs and i

865
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,320
think

866
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,440
from the vendor managed program side it

867
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,080
is about curating not just one or two

868
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,000
researchers that add value to like your

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,440
program but rather curating um

870
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,159
you know 10 to 20 that might be able to

871
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,440
kind of step up into that lead

872
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,279
researcher role and something that we

873
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,799
were discussing earlier is that when you

874
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,559
do have what i call an anchor hacker

875
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,799
it's almost a

876
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,600
disincentivizes the rest of the hacker

877
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
community from

878
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
then

879
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
working on your program because the

880
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,760
assumption is that that one researcher

881
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,519
is submitting bugs and you'll get duped

882
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,320
out on everything else right so um

883
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
one of the things that i started doing

884
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,880
while with my hacker one programs was

885
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,600
reaching out to to uh our hackers saying

886
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,919
do you have availability um we're gonna

887
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,440
be launching this new item into scope it

888
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,640
does align with um some of your

889
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,159
focus areas in the past is this

890
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,679
something you like to do and then

891
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,080
setting up an educational webinar with

892
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,880
the program team to do an overview of

893
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,080
the scope and then give some good

894
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,159
examples of what type of vulnerabilities

895
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,720
they're looking for um so i think it's

896
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,600
mostly around education knowing who is

897
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,279
um

898
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,279
who is you know available for that

899
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,279
engagement and then

900
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,279
trying to deliver value that way

901
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,840
but then since moving over to microsoft

902
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
what i did end up hearing from a

903
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,679
microsoft researcher is that

904
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,000
that was a very closed approach and how

905
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,840
do we engage more of the community that

906
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,919
might not have been able to come and

907
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,919
meet me at um you know live hacking

908
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,880
event

909
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,120
so uh we're now focused on sending out

910
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,480
quarterly outreach

911
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,960
detailing new items in scope new focus

912
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,519
areas and being a lot more broad with

913
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,120
how we're engaging our community and

914
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,360
asking them to reach out to us at again

915
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,279
bounty microsoft.com

916
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,760
let us know what your interest is and we

917
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,000
all work with you to partner

918
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,120
and make sure that we kind of get you

919
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,799
into a program or area of scope where

920
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,080
you'll be most successful

921
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,559
thanks um

922
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
sounding like a broken record a little

923
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,320
bit but we rely a lot on the

924
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,559
transparency and

925
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,799
basically all of our stuff is out there

926
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,679
so

927
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,960
it's

928
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,880
working on when you're working on closed

929
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,960
source software you kind of have to get

930
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,200
used to it to try to understand how it

931
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,799
works and then you kind of figure out if

932
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
that's a target for you maybe

933
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,960
while everything is out there and our

934
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
challenge is just to so that people

935
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
realize that it is out there and they

936
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,799
can go and read about all of that

937
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,960
and we also have a

938
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,480
a software that is updated we have a a

939
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
release a big release on the 22nd of

940
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
every month with a big list of all the

941
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,839
features so if you're it's basically the

942
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,520
menu at the restaurant for a bug bounty

943
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,440
hunter like there's two dozen new

944
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
features like which one am i gonna hack

945
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
but people have to realize that this is

946
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,399
out there that they can look at it so we

947
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,918
we update

948
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,560
we we we use social media we share those

949
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,399
those posts on our networks and also our

950
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,520
bug bounty policy has a list of

951
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,760
of the the good places to go to see what

952
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,599
we're working on what are the the most

953
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,440
recent things we release so people can

954
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,879
can look at the menu and choose what

955
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,440
they what they want and we also we made

956
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,079
a few uh ask me anything session with

957
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,119
our top hackers where we invited people

958
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,879
from the our company but also from the

959
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,879
the community to ask questions those

960
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,879
people see how they work what's

961
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,960
interesting for them and those things

962
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,560
those sessions are public and everyone

963
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
can look at them so it's uh it's fun to

964
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
understand how these people work and to

965
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,680
get some inspiration from them and maybe

966
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,359
while watching that you get an idea and

967
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,119
you can do the same thing as they did

968
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,400
then submit the next big critical bug

969
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
so so yeah it's really about

970
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,160
first step putting the information out

971
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
there and then figuring out

972
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,040
making sure matching information to

973
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
hacker like hey this is out there please

974
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,560
go look at it i swear it's really

975
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
interesting

976
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
well i follow a lot of conference or

977
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
research and blog posts and i try to

978
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,599
reach out to people that is coming with

979
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,079
outstanding research so for example if

980
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,720
there is a person that use frida to hook

981
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,599
a particular system service and whatever

982
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,040
in my opinion i think that these

983
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,359
research can be applied in our products

984
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,680
i reach out oh i am running this back

985
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
bounty program you want a test device to

986
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,480
test your tool on this thing i'm here to

987
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,320
help you to set up the environment and

988
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,720
then submit the bugs and so on

989
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,599
so for me it's important to

990
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,640
harness let's say like that top talents

991
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
and

992
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
i wanna help them that this up phase to

993
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
test our device is minimum as possible

994
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,599
so

995
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,680
some case some things are possible some

996
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,079
things are not possible like providing

997
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,320
root mobile phones is not super easy or

998
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,440
whatever

999
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,359
but in my opinion

1000
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,520
engaging people that is coming up with

1001
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,240
new ideas new research and so on is the

1002
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,000
thing that you have more benefit because

1003
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,320
you are bleeding ads research that can

1004
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
be applied on your product this for me

1005
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,599
is

1006
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,359
with some of these people i had success

1007
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,200
to work and we are super happy about the

1008
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,839
results of this precise direct

1009
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,599
engagement

1010
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,200
yeah i would agree like especially the

1011
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,839
on the community side is very so primary

1012
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,119
again i get like

1013
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,880
at least weekly emails asking me to

1014
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,320
submit to a bug quantity program but

1015
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
very few feel like hey i like very a lot

1016
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,599
of them feel just say hey do you want to

1017
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,880
work for us for free you maybe get 500

1018
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,560
for a critical buck

1019
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,920
that just doesn't work like for a

1020
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,440
researcher right like there's no

1021
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
motivation for me but when you have

1022
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,280
people who are actively like they they

1023
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,400
haven't just seen your name they're

1024
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,920
actually engaged with what you you've

1025
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,320
been doing um that's actually then quite

1026
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
interesting because then they they come

1027
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,839
like hey i've seen you you've done xyz

1028
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,359
we can offer you

1029
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,520
devices to do this and that we can't we

1030
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,200
maybe we can't pay you for it directly

1031
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
but there's a lot more um

1032
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
back and forth it's not just an email

1033
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,640
here's a link to our hacker one program

1034
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
which really like

1035
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,480
i'm not a big fan of factor one not a

1036
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
secret um because i just have been

1037
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,560
burned again and again and again um on

1038
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,280
that platform but uh right which is very

1039
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,119
anonymous because like oh here please

1040
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,960
research our stuff here's a link submit

1041
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,359
a buck and then it gets closed then you

1042
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
start discussing when you start mailing

1043
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,200
people you know at the company and so on

1044
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,320
it's like

1045
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,760
it's a mess right but when you have

1046
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,280
people who

1047
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
on the bounty side engage with the

1048
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,240
people and say like you i guess you even

1049
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,680
sent like cake for christmas

1050
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,760
like that's that's different because

1051
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
then you're also like the good will is

1052
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,599
there um because again if you do bug

1053
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,320
bounty you're already pretty skeptical

1054
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,079
that you will get any return

1055
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,839
and so if this

1056
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,599
better established communication path i

1057
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,200
think that's already like

1058
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
establishes a bidirectional trust

1059
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,560
basically

1060
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,720
another thing that we spoke

1061
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,240
before is monetary bounty is important

1062
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,640
and then we spoke about sending

1063
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,560
vulnerabilities to

1064
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,160
let's say unconventional buyers let's

1065
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,359
say that

1066
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,480
what you do when you have uh selling the

1067
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,280
vulnerability on unconventional buyers

1068
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,160
you cannot brag on your research

1069
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,400
if you submit to a bug bounty program

1070
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,280
with a dialogue with the vendor you can

1071
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,200
say okay we fix the vulnerability and we

1072
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,119
allow our customers to receive the

1073
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,920
update and so on we can reason that you

1074
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,520
can publish the

1075
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,359
in a presentation and show that we

1076
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,520
cooperate together of course

1077
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,920
these require time and also here you can

1078
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,640
have conflicts about expectations oh i

1079
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,320
have a conference next month you have 10

1080
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,000
days to price the bug and i want to go

1081
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,599
to the conference if you don't allow me

1082
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,599
to do that i get bananas and i insult

1083
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,720
you

1084
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,680
you need to find the same oh yeah in

1085
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,240
three months four months give us two

1086
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,000
seconds to look at the patch how many

1087
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
devices how many backboards we need to

1088
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,320
do the patch so it's all the time

1089
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,400
question of connecting with people and

1090
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,880
find reasonable and explain most of the

1091
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
times people submit bugs and they say oh

1092
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,119
okay they have one bug it takes one

1093
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
second to change one line of code they

1094
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,839
can make the patch and send tomorrow

1095
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,400
morning well yeah we have dispatch but

1096
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
then this patch is present in this

1097
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,160
branch is present in this other we need

1098
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
to do backwards we need

1099
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
this other country that don't have this

1100
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
type of devices we need these other

1101
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,040
regions so

1102
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,960
it's all the time creating a dialogue

1103
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
and explaining each other where are the

1104
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,680
each props of the process on this that's

1105
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,599
where a lot of companies fail right like

1106
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,960
if you look at the

1107
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,800
company that builds phone with a fruit

1108
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,960
on the back it's like you you send it

1109
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,599
back then it's silence you ask for an

1110
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,160
update silence eventually you get an

1111
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,480
email like yes we've received your back

1112
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,280
then

1113
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
three months later you learn yeah we've

1114
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,960
accepted your buck a year later you

1115
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,000
learn

1116
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,160
we will fix your buck and then

1117
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,240
eventually it gets fixed and then even

1118
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,440
later you'll learn like whether you get

1119
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
a bounty and so on it's like a complete

1120
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
black hole and there's no way to get

1121
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,520
updates except to actually spam them

1122
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
regularly with emails uh

1123
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,280
you know what i'm talking about i could

1124
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,160
see

1125
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,880
yeah

1126
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
so it's like it's a terrible experience

1127
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
right but

1128
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,839
on the other side they pay very well so

1129
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,319
it's like a two sheet of sword but i um

1130
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,720
yeah it's a lot of companies that turn a

1131
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,560
bug bounty into a complete black hole

1132
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,200
which makes me very reluctant to submit

1133
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,160
box again so i don't say that we are

1134
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
perfect we make mistakes we have

1135
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,920
not

1136
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,760
we are improving we're working we have a

1137
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,440
private background program because we

1138
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
want to give focus on the most prominent

1139
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,280
researchers and not be

1140
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,520
disturbed by a lot of rumor because as i

1141
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,599
say you can have researchers back

1142
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,480
bounding so oh i don't know i think that

1143
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,319
you're familiar with the term

1144
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,319
and then this is taking a lot of time in

1145
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,200
the triage team and so on

1146
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,240
to me when someone submits it i'm asking

1147
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
to myself what is the reply that i

1148
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,920
wanted with a type this type of

1149
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,839
submission what would be a fair

1150
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,000
treatment for me so this is what we try

1151
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,160
to give the researchers of course not

1152
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,920
every case is going perfect we have

1153
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
hitchcock's we try to improve from our

1154
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,119
mistakes

1155
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,520
and we make a triage wrong then the

1156
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,839
researcher sends a better talk but we

1157
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,079
change maybe their work so it's a

1158
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
process that we need also to learn from

1159
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,480
ourselves

1160
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,079
i think we're almost out of time now

1161
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,480
and you guys have been very sweet i was

1162
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,079
hoping some punch is going here and

1163
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,640
there to get even but yeah unfortunately

1164
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,720
that didn't happen

1165
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,440
all right so we'll open uh for audience

1166
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
question i think we just have couple of

1167
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,319
minutes

1168
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,599
any questions anyone

1169
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,119
okay um i had one specific for

1170
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,160
for you

1171
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
and you mentioned before about back

1172
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,599
porting of uh patches so i was curious

1173
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,800
uh you know the fruit logo company they

1174
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
have a lifetime for a device that is

1175
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,319
around seven years so they will patch

1176
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,000
very old devices on android we know

1177
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
that's always mostly not the case how is

1178
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,599
your policy like how you are all

1179
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,319
uh

1180
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,240
like the backboard on how many old

1181
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,520
devices go back in the years

1182
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,880
so if i remember correctly we have three

1183
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,560
years of

1184
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
porting on the on security patches for

1185
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,359
devices i need to cross check that the

1186
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,960
question is that

1187
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,880
you have devices that are different

1188
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,640
region by region so

1189
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
then you have a firmware for india area

1190
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
you have a firmware for africa or

1191
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,160
whatever and that requires time to

1192
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,760
release the firmware for all these

1193
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,400
things so before going for example with

1194
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,920
the vulnerability all the things needs

1195
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,599
to be tested in the different release of

1196
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,040
the firmware

1197
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,960
that's the point i don't know if i

1198
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,000
answer to your question

1199
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,720
okay so something coming down the pipe

1200
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,240
that isn't quite ready yet but might be

1201
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
in like one to three years are zero

1202
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,319
knowledge bug bounties um essentially a

1203
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,000
way for you to mathematically prove that

1204
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,440
you have a bug of a certain impact

1205
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,040
without actually sharing the details of

1206
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,440
it so imagine sending like a screenshot

1207
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,040
of you getting a shell

1208
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
and the company has some ability to

1209
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,599
prove that it's not a forgery

1210
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,359
how do you think that your companies

1211
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,640
would react to the development of

1212
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,079
something like that and mr stack

1213
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,079
smashing would you like prefer to only

1214
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,400
deliver bugs that way and like force

1215
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
people into using it

1216
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,920
like can you weigh some of the pros and

1217
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,319
cons of a system like that being created

1218
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,160
sure i mean like in the end so let's say

1219
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,200
you

1220
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,960
so i'm

1221
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
i will never sell

1222
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,040
exploits also right and so for me a zero

1223
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,640
knowledge my county doesn't really

1224
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,480
change anything just like i would

1225
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,079
basically then i would have the choice

1226
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,119
of either

1227
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,760
either i disclose the back or i don't if

1228
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,520
i just send proof oh look what i have

1229
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
tell me how much you're gonna pay me

1230
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,400
that sounds like extortion to me like or

1231
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
at least it's a path towards it's first

1232
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,880
so i i see the

1233
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,960
i

1234
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,440
well you see yeah that's why uh i i

1235
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,960
don't know i wouldn't call it that way

1236
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,280
the point is i would disclose it anyway

1237
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,880
even if i don't get money and that's

1238
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,920
very important to me personally so from

1239
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,800
from an

1240
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,400
africa like it wouldn't change anything

1241
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,680
for me because i would still have the

1242
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,319
same fight i would still have like i

1243
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,160
will not say just because they say i

1244
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,640
will not pay your money okay no problem

1245
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,920
i'm gonna sell it on the black market

1246
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,079
that's just not me but i see how it

1247
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,160
could appeal to people

1248
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,920
right but uh yeah i i think it's

1249
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,560
technologically i love it um but i just

1250
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,200
don't see for me personally a difference

1251
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,359
if that's the case

1252
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,960
all right sorry guys we are out of time

1253
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
yeah we'll have to close it here you can

1254
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,800
take the questions outside with the

1255
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,160
panel if you're interested in really

1256
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
sorry

1257
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,359
thank you guys thank you
