00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,720
hi

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,919
welcome to the diversity and bug hunting

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,519
uh panel my name is sarah jacobus i run

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,840
the android vulnerability reward program

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,480
at google before i hand the mic over to

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
these fabulous women to talk about their

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,640
background and just to give a brief

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,760
intro

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
i do want to give you all an exciting

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,480
announcement the android vulnerability

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
reward program has just expanded to

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,279
google devices and for a short time we

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,000
will be offering higher rewards for

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
vulnerabilities found in

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,440
nest fitbit and chromecast so if you

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
have any questions on that feel free to

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,440
find me after the panel or check out

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,280
bughunter.bughunters.google.com for more

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
information

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
all right so with that i'll hand it over

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
and ask you all to give us a brief

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
introduction and talk a little bit about

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
your background

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
hi my name is yan i run the security

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
team at brave software

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
and uh i've actually been on both sides

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,479
of the equation so i used to be more of

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
a vulnerability researcher i got

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
boundaries from stripe from google

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,600
chrome

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,920
et cetera but now i actually spend most

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
of my time running the bug bounty at

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,960
brave

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,400
and trying to get more people to

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960
participate

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
so my name is francisco buehler and i'm

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
the officer this company called passletc

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
we are

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
a devops company with an engineering

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,520
focus

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,759
i joined them in 2019 and i always had

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,799
this passion for security so i also

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
pushed this topic very hard for this

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
company

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
and last year i became the chief of this

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
company and now i have a security team

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
and also a security championship program

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
and one of the latest things we did was

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,520
a private time limited bug bounty

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
program and that's why i'm here now

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
that's one of the reasons

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,719
and in my spare time i'm also a

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,679
co-developer of the oas coral set where

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
i helped to maintain

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
enhanced and write rules for web

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
application firewalls

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
so it's apparent that my focus has

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,440
always been on defending much more than

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
on attacking things

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,040
hi i'm sheetal i'm the chief information

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
security officer for finova finoa is a

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,959
fintech it's a cryptocustodian company

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,440
and we're based in berlin

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
i have around 20 years of experience in

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,800
information security and uh well i've

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
worked on both sides both both in

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
security engineering as well as

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
compliance

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
i my first journey i think with bug

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,959
bounty started around eight years back

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
um with hacker one

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
it was a really good experience i liked

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
it so much that i even opened it

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,840
internally inside the company

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
and uh benefited from bugs being

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
identified even inside that we wouldn't

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
have identified with a penetration test

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
and we wouldn't have known because only

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
internals have that kind of deep

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,440
knowledge so i'm really looking forward

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,959
to this discussion today and uh yeah

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,120
i hand over back to you sarah

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
thanks so much all right so for our

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,799
first question

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,879
in 2019 a study by bug crowd found that

86
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
only four percent of bug hunters are

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
women another study found that only 24

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,720
of the cyber security workforce are

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
women

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
why do you feel there is not more

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
diversity in computer security

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
i also want to touch on that

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
i am specifically mentioning uh women in

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the questions that i'm asking but this

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
panel is about diversity in computer

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
security so feel free to talk about any

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
aspect

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
of of diversity

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,640
well

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,280
i think um in general we can say the

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
more diversity a community has

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
the more creativity we have and the more

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
ways of thinking and more ways of

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,439
approaching things we have

105
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,799
um

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,040
and i would like to mention the book in

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
security by shane franklin and she

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
really covers this topic really well

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
and she says that women have another way

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,720
of thinking that women

111
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
tend to assess risks differently than

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
men do and they are

113
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
highly intuitive and very creative and

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,800
these are very important things

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
that

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
very important skills that we could use

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
in this um in this cyber security field

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
and i would also like to mention a study

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
that was made with guitar pull requests

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
in 2015

121
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,479
um

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,160
researchers

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,479
investigated three million pull requests

124
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
on github and they found out that pull

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,840
requests written by women

126
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
are more likely to be approved the first

127
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
time than pull requests written by men

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
so i think this is a really important

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
fact and

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,600
another important thing is that this

131
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
changed as soon as

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
the reviewers knew that it is a woman

133
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
that opened the pull request so

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,240
as soon as

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
it was known that

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
a woman a woman opened this pull request

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
it was less likely to be approved

138
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
and i think now we come to this problem

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
that we all have these biases in mind

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
and i think this is one of the problems

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,880
we have

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
that we are short on women

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
and chen franklin also says that we are

144
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
less secure if we are short on women

145
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,000
this may sound a bit provocative but um

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,199
yeah i think she's right

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
yeah just kind of go off of that i think

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
one of the really great things about the

149
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
infosec community in general and in

150
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,919
particular bug bounties on platforms

151
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
like hacker one and crowd is you you

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
don't really know the gender of the

153
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
person you're interacting with like it's

154
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,840
often very anonymous um yeah i've seen

155
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
probably hundreds or thousands of

156
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,759
reports at this point and i don't really

157
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
notice statistics until you said it

158
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,479
because

159
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,280
it's just anonymous but um so one time a

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
few years ago i did go to this event

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,759
called

162
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,919
bounty craft that was hosted at defcon

163
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,960
by

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,919
google microsoft and facebook for some

165
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,160
of their top vulnerability researchers

166
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
so there's only people there who had

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
like reported um high or critical

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,479
severity bugs to these programs um and i

169
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,840
was actually really shocked because i

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,199
think there was

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,199
one or two women there out of like 50 to

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,759
100 people like it was myself and i

173
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
think like natalie so then so sorry i

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
can't say her name last name right but

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
not only from project zero

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,919
um who's really awesome um

177
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,199
and i don't i don't have a hard time

178
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
explaining that because i think the

179
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,520
statistics for women in infosec are

180
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,560
actually a lot better than for um for

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
about family programs from what i can

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
tell

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
one thing i i have noticed is like with

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
the

185
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
bug grounding program you have to deal

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
with a lot of projections right like you

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
have a lot of times that someone says

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
like this is not a valid vulnerability

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
and you can spend a lot of time on

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,759
something and not get any like payout um

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,120
and so that might be frustrating for

192
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
people who are like you in their careers

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
and just trying to like get a job where

194
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,840
they can have like steady income

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,080
well

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
when i think about it myself i don't

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
think about it as

198
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
say women in bug bounty as such i just

199
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,759
think about it as

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,240
the woman problem

201
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
right uh i think it will even i think

202
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
i've also experienced it as personally

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
there's um

204
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
a lot of difficulties and challenges

205
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,879
that you have to overcome uh

206
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
right from the beginning of your career

207
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
um the way people

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
uh i i would say like sometimes

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,440
when a statement in tech is made by a

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,080
man it is much more likely to be

211
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
accepted than when it is made by a woman

212
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,599
and uh so that that is something that is

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,479
really not right but i have experienced

214
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
it and i've tried my best

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
to make sure that that if there is a

216
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
woman in my team she doesn't feel the

217
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
same or if i notice someone else facing

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,599
that i i highlight it because uh what i

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,799
see why this happens is because

220
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,958
generally you feel like um

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,480
maybe women are um are not seen in tech

222
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
so much and so you

223
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
try to stereotype them to another job

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
uh coming from india where you know 50

225
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
of my class was full of girls i never

226
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,440
faced this issue so much that you know

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
they don't um kind of uh

228
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
take you as seriously as they would take

229
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,560
a man but i i did face it abroad so

230
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
i'm a bit uh uh like surprised by that

231
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,600
but i think it's also

232
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,640
it's

233
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
so when i would just say that when we

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
see that happening we must make sure

235
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,519
that we step in and ensure that ask

236
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
ourselves if that is a bias that we have

237
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
about women or it is

238
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,720
uh something that that is uh

239
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
inherited

240
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
so a follow-up question she talks

241
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
something that you mentioned and also

242
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,279
yan is um

243
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,279
actionable steps and things that we can

244
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
do given that we are all here at a

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
security conference right now there's a

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
ton of other folks in industry and at

247
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
companies um

248
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
you know while we're here talking about

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,839
it are there any pieces pieces of advice

250
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,600
that you would give you know the folks

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
here allies companies other women in the

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,519
field to

253
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,920
make this more conducive to women in

254
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
diversity in security

255
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
i think role models are very important

256
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
so

257
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
if women see other women succeed they

258
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
begin to believe that it is possible

259
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,120
so i would say connect with other women

260
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,760
be part of communities and this can help

261
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,440
a lot and but i also think it's the um

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
companies or communities or conferences

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
um

264
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
they have to to do some things right

265
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
like um

266
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
to to use a gender neutral language for

267
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
example and to show diversity and to

268
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
show

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,399
women on image so images so that others

270
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,800
begin to believe that it is just normal

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,399
um

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,440
yeah i think we should maybe also shift

273
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
away from this problem we we are short

274
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
on women and see hey but we are women

275
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,279
here

276
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,320
we are a

277
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
female women only season panel so i

278
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,600
think this is pretty cool so

279
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
yeah focus on that focus on the positive

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
things we have

281
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,240
so

282
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
kind of going back to your observation

283
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
that women's pull requests tend to be

284
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
accepted on the first attempt

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,959
as long as the gender is not known

286
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
i think so i also reviewed talks for def

287
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,839
con and i noticed a similar effect where

288
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
women who submit talks are their talks

289
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
are generally accepted at a higher

290
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,519
percentage

291
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
in the sense that like yes there are a

292
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
lot more men submitting talks to deaf

293
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
condom women but the likelihood of a

294
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,040
woman's not getting accepted is higher

295
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
because there's fewer

296
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
women applying and the talks are

297
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
generally higher quality

298
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,399
so i think there's a maybe an effect

299
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
where not only women but also minorities

300
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
who feel like they have something to

301
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
prove um or have to do things you know

302
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
right the first time are just trying

303
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
really hard to get things perfect before

304
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,800
they even make an attempt so

305
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
they make sure their talks are really

306
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
polished like are really impressive up

307
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
to the defcon standards or in the case

308
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
of a bug bounty they make they're you

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,240
know hesitant to submit a bug unless

310
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
they're sure it'll probably get a bounty

311
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
um so perhaps uh one advice i would have

312
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
is just kind of lower your standards a

313
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,519
little bit and just um you know like

314
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,680
perfect as the enemy of the good or

315
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
something where just submit things as

316
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,240
soon as you you think it could be viable

317
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,320
versus trying to really like perfect it

318
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
first time

319
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,440
and i would also say it's uh totally

320
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,839
fine to ask for help if you need some

321
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
help it's yeah and it's even allowed to

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,399
fail i would go even further and say

323
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,560
everyone fails from time to time so this

324
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
is okay as well but um

325
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
yeah it's sometimes difficult

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,120
if you're afraid of it yeah

327
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
all right so i'll move on to our next

328
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,600
question and this one is focused a

329
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
little bit more just on bug bounty

330
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
programs in general

331
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
and that is what can companies do to

332
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,880
encourage more participation in bounty

333
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,360
programs and how can companies forge

334
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
better relationships with their

335
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,439
researchers

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
i

337
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
i think about bounty program should be

338
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,760
seen kind of a collaboration cooperation

339
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,399
uh between the hunter and the uh the

340
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
company so i think for the company it

341
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,839
should be it's important that they

342
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,680
respond on time

343
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
for the findings they have and i think

344
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,880
one important thing is um

345
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
that they are friendly to the they are

346
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,839
thankful because the research probably

347
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,920
invested a lot of her time to find the

348
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,880
vulnerability and to help my

349
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,519
to help secure my system

350
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,920
so i should be thankful the work she did

351
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
and appreciate the work she did i think

352
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,639
this is important to

353
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,199
like meet at eye level and

354
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
have a good partnership i think this is

355
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
important

356
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
i i think that's really important i

357
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
think that's something that i really hit

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
home with me the first security

359
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
conference that i went to is

360
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
you know really during

361
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
how much time and effort researchers are

362
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,079
spending into this and when companies um

363
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,760
you know are not being transparent and

364
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
they're not responding quickly i feel

365
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,680
like sometimes the message that you're

366
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
sending is we're not valuing you or or

367
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
your work so that's a lot of the the

368
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,839
feedback that i've gotten from other

369
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
conferences as well

370
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,480
yeah so having having been both a

371
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
researcher and running a bug bounty i

372
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
think there's a lot of misunderstanding

373
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
and frustration because as a researcher

374
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,160
often you feel like people are ignoring

375
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
you like they'll not respond for months

376
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,440
or they'll say like we're busy with

377
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,560
other things

378
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
or sometimes people won't even have ways

379
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,639
to report a bug that you know you can

380
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,240
easily find on their website and so

381
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,880
forth uh but on the company side you get

382
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
so many um spammy reports um my

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
co-worker andrea calls these back bounty

384
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
where people are just like like you know

385
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
it's not a really really critical

386
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
vulnerability but they try to make it

387
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,079
sound like it's really bad and when you

388
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,920
say no they they'll come back and just

389
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,480
try to like get you to pay out so

390
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
i think

391
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
on both sides people need to have

392
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
patience and just like have empathy

393
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,639
i have a question to you um is it

394
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,839
allowed to

395
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,639
not respond to back bounties or

396
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,440
i try to always send a response but

397
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,079
sometimes and they come back again and

398
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,880
again and sometimes it's enough now yeah

399
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
the best part is when they start to like

400
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
threaten you like um intentionally or

401
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,399
unintentionally like if you don't

402
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,160
respond to this we'll publish a blog

403
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,839
post and it'll make you look really bad

404
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
and i think

405
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,160
from my perspective i always respond at

406
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
least and say like this is why we don't

407
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
think this is valid but at some point if

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,279
i don't feel like they're being

409
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
completely um

410
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,160
if i think they're being a little

411
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
disingenuous or trying to like really

412
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,759
exaggerate what they're doing we'll just

413
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,600
stop responding because we know that

414
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
even if they do publish that blog post

415
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
that makes it sound really bad we have

416
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
like a solid counter argument that's why

417
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,399
we didn't fix that

418
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,320
so

419
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
from what i understood your question was

420
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
how can you increase by diversity

421
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
in the bug bounty programs you run

422
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
when i think about it

423
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
to be very honest i would not um

424
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,360
i would

425
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,759
when i have a managed program i have a

426
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,279
limited budget

427
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,240
uh i want the best researchers right and

428
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
and i think uh

429
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,839
um

430
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
if if i come from a like probably a very

431
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
large enterprise of course you can have

432
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
that benefit of saying yes i will give

433
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
some additional uh you know

434
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
points on you know making sure that we

435
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,160
also have women researchers in our bug

436
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
bounty program

437
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
but i see that most startups to be very

438
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
honest would not be in that position to

439
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,399
say yes i dedicate a certain section or

440
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
quota of my my uh bug bounty program to

441
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,560
women

442
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,680
so but what i have seen is

443
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
i feel like it is pretty fair to be

444
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,319
honest because it is enormous it is uh

445
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,280
um

446
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
so

447
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
what i've not i've not really felt that

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,839
it has

449
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,879
any kind of um

450
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,400
disadvantage for women that you know to

451
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
shine out yeah so if they want to you

452
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,359
can right it's it's all anonymous and

453
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,319
you have to just prove yourself

454
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,679
uh so you touched on a really

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,360
interesting point and something since

456
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
you know we're talking about diversity

457
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
in general

458
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
there are also studies that have shown

459
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
that there is a much higher

460
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
likelihood that individuals with autism

461
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
and those that are neurodiverse

462
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
are

463
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
more of them are in computer security

464
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
than in the general population

465
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
and as someone who you know runs a

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
bounty program that was my first thought

467
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,840
well it's not on me i have no idea who

468
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,280
this individual is i don't know their

469
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
gender i don't know their age i don't

470
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
know anything about them but i think to

471
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
an extent it's also on

472
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,440
us as as people who run bounty programs

473
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
to make sure that our language our

474
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,320
emails and our processes are conducive

475
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
to people of all cultures and all ways

476
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,400
of of thinking so the ways that we word

477
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
our rules pages you know is this going

478
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
to make sense to people of other

479
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
cultures started trying to make sure

480
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,440
that we're not using things like

481
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
euphemisms i know i say fire off an

482
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,679
email all the time and that is something

483
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,400
that literally won't translate

484
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,919
so i think that is important to keep in

485
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
mind that you know we can proactively

486
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
make this a much more inclusive

487
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,799
community

488
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
all right

489
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
so um next question is what advice would

490
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,280
you give to someone starting out in the

491
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,919
computer security field especially young

492
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,320
women or those who are diverse in a

493
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,240
minority group in security

494
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,600
well uh when when i think about it i

495
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
feel um they should just not be afraid

496
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
they should believe in themselves they

497
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,600
should know that security is a tough

498
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
field yeah you would sometimes you're

499
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
like you're expected to know everything

500
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
and that's just not possible

501
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
you have to know your strengths and you

502
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
have to stand by it and you have to keep

503
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,080
learning right that's part of life and

504
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,200
you will learn as part of your job so be

505
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,840
confident of yourself and know that you

506
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,039
will succeed

507
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,840
uh don't let negative criticism or you

508
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
know like even when people ignore you

509
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
let don't let that

510
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,919
walk you down just much ahead

511
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
i think you have to keep that positive

512
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
outlook and keep moving on

513
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,360
and i would say to her

514
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,760
did you know that

515
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,799
women apply for a job if they meet 100

516
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
of the requirements and men apply for a

517
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
job if they meet 60 of the requirements

518
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
so i would say have this in mind because

519
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,880
i think

520
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,360
women sometimes feel that they are less

521
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
capable to do things but in fact they

522
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,200
are not

523
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
so with having this in mind this can

524
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,120
change maybe and help maybe to

525
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,000
well to to believe in in herself

526
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
that's actually something on old

527
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,360
co-worker of mines uh said when we were

528
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,760
writing job listings was uh initially we

529
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
were just saying

530
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
saying kind of like you need these

531
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
skills and these are also good to have

532
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,280
and then you should also have these

533
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
skills and it was just a long list of

534
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
skills and we kind of had the implicit

535
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
expectation that people would apply even

536
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
if they didn't have all the skills but

537
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
then a co-worker was like actually you

538
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
know women are more likely or even

539
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,240
minorities are more likely to only apply

540
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
if they have all of these so either be

541
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
really clear that you don't expect

542
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,440
everyone to have 100 of these

543
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
qualifications or just you know leave

544
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,559
some of them out

545
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
um and i would say for people starting

546
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,039
out in their careers that

547
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
uh i really like open the open source

548
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,679
community i think um you know when i i

549
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,559
saw i studied physics and i kind of had

550
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,200
to like self-teach computer science and

551
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,799
programming

552
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,120
after graduating and one of the ways i

553
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,039
learned the quickest was just from

554
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
using open source software saying

555
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,880
there's these bugs i want to fix or i

556
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
want to be fixed so therefore i'm

557
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
motivated to fix them and then like

558
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,159
participating in those communities

559
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,520
especially if you're not at the level

560
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
where you can get a job or internship

561
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,120
easily

562
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
you can still contribute to open source

563
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
so if someone looks at your resume and

564
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,480
they say it says like you've had

565
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
patches accepted to these projects like

566
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
that counts for something even if you're

567
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
not you don't have any prior work

568
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,080
experience

569
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
i would say this concept of mentorship

570
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,159
can help as well but sometimes it's not

571
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,720
that easy to find a good mentor but i

572
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
think this is maybe something that could

573
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
help as well

574
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,039
mentorship and to have a good mentor and

575
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
see others succeed as well

576
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
absolutely

577
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,960
so one of the questions that at least i

578
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
think that i get asked the most when it

579
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,280
comes to bounty programs is

580
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,919
for for anyone any stage in their career

581
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,799
you know

582
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,200
any anywhere in the world uh people who

583
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
are looking to submit their first bug

584
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
it's very intimidating um like you said

585
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
maybe the first one to

586
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,360
a few dozen bugs might get rejected but

587
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
what would you recommend is a good

588
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,200
starting part how can you break into

589
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
this this world of bug bounty programs

590
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,640
i think my first bug was um actually

591
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
just based on having having read

592
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,120
someone's blog post like a hacker i

593
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
really respected about

594
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
a certain class of like web app like

595
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
crsrf bypasses or something and then

596
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,960
just looking for other websites where

597
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,919
this might be a thing because he

598
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,600
initially found it on github and then i

599
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,520
found on some other websites so that's

600
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,440
like a kind of easier way seeing like

601
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
what kind of bugs have been accepted by

602
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
big programs and if i just take this bug

603
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,840
and look for it on other sites i can

604
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
submit it to those programs and get free

605
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,960
money

606
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,200
i think another thing actually from the

607
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,960
people running a bug bounty side of

608
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
things that helps a lot is being really

609
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,039
generous with when you allow people to

610
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,240
disclose

611
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
um because especially for people

612
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
starting out in their careers a big

613
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,159
reason they participate in bug bounties

614
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,640
is so that they can put on their resume

615
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
and write a blog post and get some

616
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
attention for it so if you make it

617
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
really hard for people to write a blog

618
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,440
post they're less likely to be

619
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,480
encouraged to participate

620
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,559
well i'm not a hunter i'm not a

621
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
researcher but i would say

622
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,159
also have a look at all the

623
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,080
vulnerabilities have a look at all the

624
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,039
reports we kind of learn a lot from them

625
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,760
and sometimes things repeat sometimes

626
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
when i see a reporter say oh no please

627
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,039
not this problem again so i think

628
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,840
maybe that is a good starting point

629
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,080
uh so i know that all of us up here are

630
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
more on the side of running bounty

631
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
programs and i know young you have some

632
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,480
experience uh with reporting but

633
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
what would you like to what advice would

634
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,159
you like to give researchers like this

635
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,440
is something that i see all the time

636
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
please stop doing this or please start

637
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,240
doing this other thing um and maybe on

638
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
the flip side

639
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
not to put you on the spot but if

640
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
there's anything that you wish that

641
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
bounty programs knew or would start

642
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
doing

643
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,720
so i i don't know if this is like the

644
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,279
right audience to um tell this to but we

645
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,720
got a lot of reports where people just

646
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
ran like an ssl scanner and it's like

647
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
you use the cipher that's slightly out

648
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
of date or insecure

649
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,559
we really don't appreciate reports

650
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,559
they're just copy pasted of automated

651
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,679
scanners

652
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,039
although sometimes they are actually

653
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
valid um

654
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,679
and then yeah i guess on the flip side i

655
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,840
think as people running programs like i

656
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
said make it really easy for people to

657
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,880
disclose

658
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,799
uh bugs if they want that's that's

659
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,760
probably my biggest thing

660
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
i would say for the company it would be

661
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,159
really helpful if i get a good report if

662
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,720
i have a step-by-step guide on how to

663
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
reproduce it

664
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
because um

665
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
maybe the developer doesn't have this

666
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,039
security knowledge but the researcher

667
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,480
has so she can explain um why this is

668
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
bad and maybe even on how this can be

669
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,760
mitigated this would help a lot

670
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
and i think if um

671
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,480
the researcher provides more information

672
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
why this is bad or why this is a problem

673
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,039
how this can be mitigated

674
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,600
i think the awareness can grow

675
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
at the company's side because if they

676
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
only fix this one report it's not um

677
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
well

678
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,960
maybe the same everywhere will happen

679
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
again and

680
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
if um

681
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,640
we kind of begin to collaborate

682
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
um and explain why this is bad the

683
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
awareness can grow and maybe we can we

684
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
don't have this problem anymore in the

685
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,320
future with this kind of vulnerability i

686
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
think this

687
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,159
awareness security awareness on the

688
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,919
developer side is

689
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,720
a

690
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,559
really important aspect as well i think

691
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,400
yeah i think i agree with you guys that

692
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
you need to have uh i see that a lot of

693
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,840
bounty hunters they when they're very

694
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
really just focused

695
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,480
on that one line and they love doing

696
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
what they do with bug hunting and

697
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,640
malware detection and all of that they

698
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,360
uh

699
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,000
do not focus on any other areas so i

700
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,159
think you have to realize that the

701
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,120
audience that you are reaching out to is

702
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
probably not the bug hunting type and

703
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
they're just

704
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,159
dealing with

705
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,679
creating code

706
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,840
and they don't really understand the

707
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,360
impact of what you are describing so

708
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,159
it is of course very important that you

709
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,080
learn to communicate it well and not in

710
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
that aggressive or in a very bashful

711
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,559
manner but more in a very collaborative

712
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,720
manner that and that will help both

713
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
sides

714
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,480
and for me as the company i always think

715
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
it's very helpful if i know that the

716
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
research has a lot of knowledge about

717
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,200
the technology i use so

718
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,039
then i have the feeling that well we

719
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,799
never have this 100 of security but

720
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,559
maybe if i have a researcher that digs

721
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
deep into uh

722
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,200
technology and knows a lot about it then

723
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,279
i feel kind of

724
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
almost bulletproof yeah i know we don't

725
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,960
have but if

726
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
i know that research has a note a lot of

727
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,840
knowledge of this technology i think

728
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,320
this would be good and

729
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
i also think that um

730
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
reconnaissance is as important as

731
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,720
exploiting things because

732
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,000
for the last bundy program we had a

733
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,039
large scope a white scope and of course

734
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,440
i hope it's not the fact that maybe we

735
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,559
have systems that we have forgotten that

736
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,039
they are running and i think these are

737
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,760
the systems that are dangerous as well

738
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
because they are not patched anymore

739
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
so i think if um

740
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
others help me to find maybe forgotten

741
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,919
systems this would be helpful as well

742
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,480
well i hope we don't have but

743
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,120
we never know

744
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,559
wow you guys were really nice i was

745
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
expecting so i'm like oh my gosh i wish

746
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,679
they would stop sending us this

747
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,320
um but we uh before we turn it over to

748
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
the audience to see if any of you all

749
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
have some some questions for our

750
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,679
panelists uh

751
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,760
final words any other

752
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,200
leaving thoughts that anyone had

753
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
so i really like it when people give us

754
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,559
actual proof of concepts not just so we

755
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,000
get some reports that are really vague

756
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,600
about why like we don't really

757
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
understand why it's a vulnerability but

758
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,880
if you can you know actually like take

759
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,799
over a domain or do something like that

760
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
and show us then we immediately will

761
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,760
notice and triage it much faster

762
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
and i know some people are hesitant to

763
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,799
do this because at least in the us

764
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,399
there's cfa and there's other

765
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,000
anti-computer abuse and

766
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
crime acts

767
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,919
so i think like on the company side you

768
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,120
can just make sure people know that

769
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,559
you're friendly to researchers you're

770
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,480
not going to sue them if they

771
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,320
breach something for the sake of showing

772
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,320
vulnerability

773
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
all right well uh we'll turn it over to

774
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,039
the audience and ask if anyone has any

775
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,520
questions

776
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,919
um so my question goes to you since you

777
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,240
have a lot of experience no finding bugs

778
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
and all that and i wouldn't you know how

779
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,520
you keep up with tools because

780
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,679
this vast majority of you is coming up

781
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
and you know um like i think it's model

782
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
he writes a lot of tools and all the

783
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
other researchers to provide positive

784
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,559
tools is that many apis such domains and

785
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,799
all that so how do you keep up with this

786
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,200
stills

787
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,440
oh thanks so i i i so i had the same

788
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
question early on in my career i'm like

789
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
oh burp suite like kali linux so many

790
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
things uh how am i going to get good at

791
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,600
them all and the answer is you can't so

792
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,200
there's so many bugs in software that

793
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
really if you just get good at a few

794
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
tools you can find bugs um and i think

795
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,840
the general message is don't try to be

796
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,120
good at everything you're not going to

797
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,240
be like an amazing browser exploiter and

798
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
also like an amazing

799
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,559
cloud hacker at the same time so

800
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,159
it's better i think to specialize and

801
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,600
just pick one thing you're going to like

802
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,440
get really good at and focus on that but

803
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,360
of course you know always try to keep

804
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,678
learning

805
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,210
[Music]

806
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
so uh

807
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,480
my wife looks at me

808
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,559
doing security and doing bug bounces and

809
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,039
doing pen tests on the sides and she she

810
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,679
looks at oh my god you got so much money

811
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,200
we don't

812
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,519
and you need to teach me how to do pen

813
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,840
tests we're going to be rich so he's

814
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
she's

815
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,039
fully motivated uh financially i say

816
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,640
it's not only that

817
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,799
so and she knows nothing about computers

818
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,480
which is okay

819
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,080
what is the recommendation for you so

820
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
how do i deal with it at home i really

821
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,919
i really want to help i don't not only

822
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,279
want to fix the printer yeah i mean

823
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,399
what is the advice you have for me

824
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
well i think not the money is important

825
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,919
of course i think it should start with a

826
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,480
curiosity that you are curious to learn

827
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
things that you want to understand how

828
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
it works and so on and so i think it

829
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
should start with this passion for

830
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,640
security and not yeah

831
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,559
not uh because of the money i think

832
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,440
so uh from what i understood i feel

833
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,600
she's quite curious as well

834
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,080
and i think well you could start with

835
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,600
small things that you're you're an

836
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,159
expert and right and you know that

837
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,799
they are easy to pick up it just has jan

838
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,039
said probably a blog that might inspire

839
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,039
her and she could search for the same

840
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,039
thing somewhere else and

841
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,360
even her small exercises that she could

842
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,279
feel confident of executing

843
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,519
i know i'm the moderator however

844
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,600
i will say too something that i really

845
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
like to do with

846
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
people who are very new into security i

847
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
think it's such an overwhelming space um

848
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
something that i also really like to

849
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,080
start with are some easier capture the

850
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,320
flag competitions because i think right

851
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,399
off the bat you are like oh my god i'm a

852
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,080
hacker you know i'm like running through

853
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,240
all this code so i do think that that is

854
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,799
also a way to get that you know reward

855
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,840
uh feeling earlier

856
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,720
any other questions

857
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,320

858
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
