perspectives that we have in this uh

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,860
this particular panel so on my left we

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
have Mr Naveen Kumar Singh who is the

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,700

infrastructure from a cyber security

23

officer he is serving uh and uh comes

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,740
from the jharkhand Carter I just wanted

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,180
to mention two important things about

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,920
Naveen one is that he's from IIT kanpur

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,900
and uh he has won a gallantry medal

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
while in police and these are two

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
different difficult things to achieve

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
and he has taken over ncibc some time

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,560
back and he has been in introducing

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,180
various initiatives which I'm sure you

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,720
will talk about we also have himanshu

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,720
who is a Caesar born in a company born

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,180
in Cloud so we would definitely want to

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,659
hear from you uh himanshu and we have

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,380
Ganesh from icsa Bank joining us

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,000
remotely Ganesh good to see you on

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,960
screen and Ganesh comes from technology

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,399
background himself I am Calcutta and he

42
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,840
has been ciso in icsci uh before that he

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,280
was handling technology management roles

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,660
and uh we would like to hear from uh

45
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,619
Ganesh as well

46
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,040
so the structure of the this session is

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,500
that I will request the panelists to

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,860
give their uh specific perspectives and

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,280
uh then we'll come to the Q a part but

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,520
before we uh before I ask the my

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,599
colleagues to talk about their

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
perspectives I want to briefly touch

53
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,140
upon the topic itself and the topic is

54
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,860
about

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,080
Financial inclusion

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,599
using cloud and the security aspects of

57
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,420
it why Financial included why this

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,120
rather esoteric Topic in a technology

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,879
conference As We Know

60
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,519
you know in India we're seeing so much

61
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,920
of change and so much of transformation

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,220
happening that sometimes it uh it kind

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,720
of uh uh we lose track of time and I was

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,940
just talking to somebody other day of an

65
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,480
event in 1999 I was telling them how we

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,519
didn't have cell phones at that time and

67
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,379
no way of you know using Google to find

68
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,540
the directions and so on of course in

69
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,440
last

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,620
10 years the kind of proliferation of

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,239
technology that we have seen is

72
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,940
everybody's aware how it has been going

73
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,239
most importantly form a government point

74
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,580
of view digital India which is the big

75
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,280
overarching initiative is very important

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,239
from

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,580
uh from governance point of view in

78
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,680
delivery of government services making

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,500
them affordable making them consistent

80
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,019
making them of high quality uh making

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,040
them Reach the you know the last person

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,099
in the society and for this technology

83
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,599
is going to be the infrastructure which

84
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,760
you deliver all this now Financial

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,120
inclusion as we know is the key to

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,140
getting people onto the digital Highway

87
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,319
and uh of course social

88
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,580
media social platforms have been doing

89
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,739
this for many of the middle class people

90
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,440
but if you look at the the next billion

91
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,900
so to say they are all looking at

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,200
tangible services and and technology-led

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,480
financial services ranks very high in

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,820
that now Financial inclusion as you know

95
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,699
is something which uh is something which

96
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,040
is a Holy Grail all governments talk

97
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,139
about it for a necessary for economic

98
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,020
progress and uh recently as you might

99
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,540
have noticed uh especially if you're

100
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,120
from the financial services sector RBI

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,340
has come out with a index which measures

102
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,080
Financial inclusion

103
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,040
and the index has 97 parameters and it

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
is a way RB is measuring how the

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,120
proliferation of technology and its

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,639
increasing reach is helping Financial

107
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,220
inclusion itself now if you look at

108
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,160
Financial inclusion it comprises of

109
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,259
banking digital insurance and pension

110
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,240
the four different verticals within

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
financial services and within that there

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,800
are

113
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,860
uh you know Supply LED sides like access

114
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,720
and there are demanded sites like

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,080
quality and uh

116
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,120
frequency views uh as you might have

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,340
seen India has done very well on access

118
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,400
in recent times almost 75 percent

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,620
progress has come from providing access

120
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,800
which includes the jam Trinity and the

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,780
kind of payment service proliferation

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,820
that we have seen in recent months

123
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,139
particularly during the pandemic time

124
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,979
and these this boards well because now

125
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,600
uh you go to a smaller shop and there is

126
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,580
a UPI option available for making

127
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,320
payments and so on

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,880
so

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,639
how will Cloud help in this now that is

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,120
the question and uh as we heard in the

131
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,340
previous session also this is something

132
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,020
which takes away the infrastructure

133
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,380
related hassles of the or organization

134
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,539
which are building and delivering

135
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,880
products and services and uh the

136
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,039
challenge for security communities how

137
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,419
to keep safe

138
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,280
so with that background I think we have

139
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,560
an excellent panel which comprises of

140
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,539
somebody from the regulatory side

141
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,660
government side law enforcement side and

142
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,539
then we also have a large Bank

143
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,180
represented and we have a born in Cloud

144
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,280
company so I would request my

145
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
co-panelists to share their perspective

146
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
starting with Mr Naveen Singh if you

147
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,400
would like to share

148
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,780
[Music]

149
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,560
hi everyone I think India has done a

150
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
reasonably well in

151
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,240
improving the financial inclusion in the

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,819
country in the last decade

153
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,340
and

154
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,020
this is a largely due to the various

155
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,539
initiatives of the government of India

156
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,720
the most important one of it uh

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,000
Mr nand Kumar already talked about is

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,880
the digital India initiative through

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,919
which um

160
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,940
I think the major thing was to provide

161
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,860
the Broadband connectivity toward the

162
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,660
rural areas if you actually see the

163
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,240
amount of optical fiber cables which

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
have been laid in the last five years

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,880
that is simply phenomenal and we are

166
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,520
almost reaching every panchayats now

167
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,660
through it

168
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,539
and apart from that a lot of

169
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,819
these governments uh service deliveries

170
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,699
they have been improved by uh moving on

171
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,539
to

172
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,139
um digital uh mode of delivery of

173
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,720
services whether it is payment of

174
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
the

175
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
subsidies or or

176
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,240
direct transfer of the benefits so all

177
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,340
these things by making it electronic the

178
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,680
government has improved transparency and

179
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,380
delivery so it is not only helped in

180
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,300
governance but it is also empowered the

181
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,319
people

182
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,199
and and this is because of the clear

183
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,180
directions from the government and apart

184
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,580
from this the government has also

185
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,080
started this financial inclusion Mission

186
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,979
uh uh the objective of which was that

187
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,720
all Indians should have a bank account

188
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,500
and due to this since 2014 the number of

189
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,599
bank accounts if you see have increased

190
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,360
by more than 4.5 times and now the

191
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,819
number of bank accounts in India

192
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,560
is around 109 crores as per the uh the

193
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,680
figures I had seen last end of 2021 so

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,720
that almost shows that most of the

195
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,580
Indians are now having a bank account

196
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,080
thanks to the initiatives of the

197
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,280
government and then of course

198
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,820
demonetization this pandemic these have

199
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,339
all contributed to the increase in

200
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,419
digitization and and hence in the uh

201
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,760
Financial inclusion but I think one

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,860
thing which has played uh the most

203
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,920
important role here is the the is the

204
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,600
new Financial products which were

205
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,640
offered by the cloud native companies

206
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,519
basically the e-wallets and the npci

207
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,140
they have really done a phenomenal job

208
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,360
in the sense that they have cut the

209
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
Monopoly of the

210
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,080
um credit card companies like MasterCard

211
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,000
and Visa where we are to unnecessarily

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,279
pay commission for every transactions

213
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,920
with India having its own payment

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,019
gateways and the payment infrastructure

215
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,140
now we are also not under the threat of

216
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,660
any kind of

217
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,700
of sanctions or any of non-availability

218
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,399
of services and all this has happened

219
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,160
mainly because of these Cloud native

220
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,019
companies where where they could reduce

221
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,480
their their costs and they could focus

222
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,360
on the developing the the right kind of

223
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,860
financial services products without

224
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,800
bothering for the infrastructure and and

225
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,040
without and it being a cost effective so

226
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
I

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,540
I I I feel Cloud uh adoption has

228
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,640
definitely helped us in uh Financial

229
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,899
inclusion

230
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,300
and more Innovative products in the

231
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,640
insurance pension and maybe in the

232
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,140
credit disbursement

233
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,600
and the credit repayment things if more

234
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,300
Innovative products are are there in

235
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,580
these fields also then definitely the

236
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,160
financial inclusion is is going to

237
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
increase and

238
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,740
a cloud because it helps in the

239
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,019
scalability of the operations it helps

240
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,480
in quick adoption of the technology it

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,760
helps in

242
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,500
in quick Innovation and testing of your

243
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,240
products before launch of the market so

244
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,480
I see Cloud definitely has a role in in

245
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,880
improving the financial inclusion in the

246
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,420
days to come and it Cloud we can also

247
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,300
help the the small cooperative and the

248
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,180
rural Banks Etc in having a cost

249
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,580
effective move towards technology

250
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,580
so this can definitely be an enabler for

251
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,040
financial inclusion is what I think

252
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,339
thank you thank you I wanted to uh

253
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,620
request Ganesh he has long experience in

254
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,079
banking how does he see uh things from

255
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,859
his point of view vanish

256
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,660
good afternoon everyone hope you can all

257
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,500
uh hear me

258
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,800
but just actually

259
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,260
made the most important point that if

260
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,120
you really look at any established

261
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,279
market today any large geographies today

262
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,440
I think India probably can

263
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,860
hold its head high in terms of broader

264
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,920
Financial inclusion I think our UPI is

265
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,140
probably something that any large

266
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,000
economy can be proud of and I don't

267
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,380
think anyone has pulled off anything

268
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,920
very anywhere close to it and one of the

269
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
other things that comes to my mind is we

270
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,140
are probably the only large economy

271
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,760
where every type of payment is available

272
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,980
24x7 all the way across somebody wanting

273
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,860
to let us say transfer 100 crores to

274
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,959
somebody who is just walking across the

275
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,300
street and wants to buy let's say one

276
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,880
dozen bananas all of these systems are

277
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,980
available 24x7 this is something that

278
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,320
even very very large economies don't

279
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,660
have they all a lot of their very large

280
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,100
corporate Payment Systems actually

281
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,279
operate uh five days or banking hours

282
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
and stuff like that so we have really

283
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,600
come a long way in enabling Financial

284
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,360
inclusion particularly from the

285
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,300
financial services sector and across

286
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,120
different customer base and today in

287
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,060
fact we find a lot of situations where

288
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,300
among our customer base uh quite often

289
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,600
digital adoption is uh much faster with

290
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
the new set of population which is

291
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,839
coming on into banking that and even

292
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,360
people who are kind of exposed to the

293
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,579
older methods sometimes you say no that

294
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,860
is you LeapFrog one generation so a lot

295
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,060
of our population is actually

296
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,279
leapfrogged one generation we are

297
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,839
directly transacting on the smartphones

298
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,720
without having ever had a credit card or

299
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,120
ever had a plastic card so that that's a

300
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,160
great thing that as a country we are in

301
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,180
and I definitely agree with uh Mr Singh

302
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,180
in terms of how Cloud creates the

303
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,000
literally almost a flat structure or a

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Level Playing Field but today

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,459
a very sophisticated capability which

306
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,700
could be the world's best CRM or uh

307
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
which could be the most Innovative

308
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,980
payment product is available as much to

309
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,160
a very very small payment player or a

310
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,440
very small Bank asked much to a very

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,959
large Bank like ours so that difference

312
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,620
kind of uh between uh capabilities that

313
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,600
one can come up and one can offer to the

314
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,220
market and in terms of time to Market

315
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,560
that is getting really really kind of

316
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,740
literally disappearing which is which is

317
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,660
not necessarily always good news for

318
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,279
maybe people like us but at the same

319
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,680
time that kind of puts us puts People

320
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,360
Like Us on the toes and then make sure

321
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,820
that we offer even better capability and

322
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,000
even better features and new response to

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,100
our customers so that way this is

324
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,600
something that is kind of a win-win

325
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,880
situation for everyone and this kind of

326
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,680
healthy competition and people trying to

327
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,980
offer much better both services and uh

328
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,620
what profitable offers to the customers

329
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,940
I think it's kind of at the end of

330
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,459
foreign

331
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:02,100
and makes it better and better for our

332
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,540
kind of ever growing uh both middle

333
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,160
class as well as aspiring middle class

334
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
population so I think this is in a way a

335
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,019
great win-win situation for us to be in

336
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,779
and obviously as we go through the rest

337
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,040
of the panel we will talk about

338
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
challenges we will talk about uh some of

339
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,019
the safeguards that one has to

340
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,180
take care but nevertheless this is a

341
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,760
great opportunity and a great juncture

342
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,500
that we are sitting in

343
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,339
foreign

344
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,000
so born out of cloud

345
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
um one of the most important challenge

346
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,880
for us four years back was how do we

347
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,920
build systems that people can trust

348
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,019
right so we're trying to build systems

349
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,320
for affluent citizens of India

350
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,820
um now if you look at the affiliate

351
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,399
segment of India obviously we had to

352
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,199
build systems which people can trust

353
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,139
right so trust was very important and um

354
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,880
this was very challenging for us also

355
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,399
right uh how do we establish Trust on

356
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,360
cloud

357
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,600
for the citizens of India keeping all

358
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,839
the regulatory aspect in mind right so

359
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,820
um I was amongst the founding member and

360
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,899
and I got an opportunity to basically

361
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,240
um make some of these design changes or

362
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,040
understand or architect all these

363
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,800
designs in his uh four years back

364
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,440
so I was fortunate enough to unlearn

365
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,940
from all my mistakes from my previous

366
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,779
company uh also given a fact that we

367
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,139
wanted to have a cloud first approach

368
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,579
um keeping all the regulatory

369
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,399
requirements mine and also build a

370
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,000
scalable system which can possibly

371
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
scale five years six years down the line

372
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,740
it was very challenging for us

373
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
um to understand how the whole ecosystem

374
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,180
is going to be on the cloud right and

375
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,220
even looking from a product standpoint

376
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,100
we being a product company uh how do we

377
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,980
build a narrative that this product uh

378
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,920
fits into Security First uh as a concept

379
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
uh and and ensures all the Regulatory

380
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,320
and compliance requirements where some

381
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,760
of the key challenges that we had to

382
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
face from Day Zero itself right so it

383
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,139
was very imperative for us to think

384
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,180
through all of these factors account all

385
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,980
of these factors and have very strong

386
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,440
strategy in place

387
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,740
um to think about how we are going to

388
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,079
build the trust for all our end users

389
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,180
right so keeping all these things in

390
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,139
mind

391
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,560
um we are able to uh make few iterations

392
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,860
actually we made 70 nutritions of our

393
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,500
application before we launched right so

394
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,300
every time we would go through we would

395
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,920
identify that there are things missing

396
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,779
there are some architecture changes

397
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,820
required how do we align with all the

398
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,740
Regulatory and compliance requirements

399
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,100
right so all these questions for a MBP

400
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,100
were very much pretty much documented

401
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,040
um a lot of things from our industry

402
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,160
standpoint like PC adss CIS looking at

403
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,320
cyber security framework these were some

404
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,899
of the key aspects that we took from our

405
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,040
previous learning from our previous

406
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,980
company where a lot of us failed

407
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,599
actually because all of us had

408
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,160
background

409
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,780
um dealing with a lot of bureaucracies

410
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,419
in the company in our previous companies

411
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,040
dealing with a lot of work hierarchies

412
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,540
are not able to work with our partners

413
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,000
so all these problems were solved here

414
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,459
we had to we had to basically unlearn

415
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,740
all those come up with a very fresh mind

416
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,780
and try to understand what is going to

417
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,640
be significant for us in next four to

418
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,140
five years

419
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,720
um so we started with payments at the

420
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,700
ecosystem

421
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,200
providing payment services from our

422
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,480
platform

423
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,000
in last four years fast forward there

424
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,940
has been a lot of support from npci from

425
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,059
Regulators if you look at Banks aspect

426
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,559
also I think we have partnered with a

427
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
lot many banks in India and they have

428
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,299
helped us basically grow

429
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:59,760
in context of lot of Frameworks now if

430
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,140
you look at a lot of Frameworks in

431
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,340
context of India there there's a lot of

432
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,039
a lot of Master guidelines from RBI NPC

433
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,039
has helped a lot there are a lot of npci

434
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,559
requirements now if you start looking or

435
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,320
have a very cloud-centric view to all of

436
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,179
these requirements I think you will

437
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,640
start to build a graph and you will

438
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,960
start to see there are a lot of of

439
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,179
overlapping controls which are Cloud

440
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,580
first security company a security first

441
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,580
company should adapt and and we had all

442
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,799
these flexibility to look at um all

443
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,900
these aspect from a legality point of

444
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,880
view from a industry standard point of

445
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,980
view from some of the compliances that

446
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,840
we wanted to achieve

447
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
um by the time we launched our first

448
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,520
product so all these uh Central View

449
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,860
gave us give us a Clarity to how do we

450
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,020
achieve automation right so automation

451
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,940
actually became a very key point in

452
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,039
crucial Central Point

453
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,039
um not only to embed compliance and

454
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,620
security into product but also to build

455
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,580
trust

456
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,280
ah so we took that as an opportunity to

457
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,559
identify what are these factors which

458
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,260
could be automated right some of the

459
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,299
um very important things that company

460
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,880
face problems while they grow very very

461
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,340
fast is identity kind of becomes a

462
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,900
problem right in a company there would

463
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,760
be multiple identities so these were

464
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
some of the learnings that we had that

465
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
um some of the key aspect like

466
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
um Identity On A Cloud should be solved

467
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
from desio right

468
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,200
um in terms of incident response how do

469
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,600
we take it very very seriously

470
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,160
um and there's a lot of support again

471
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,840
from the previous Converses and also you

472
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,419
heard about certain

473
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,360
um coming up with a lot of guideline in

474
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,039
terms of how Cloud first company can

475
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,320
adapt right so all these guidance has

476
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,520
actually helped us give a very

477
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,860
directional view of how our Cloud first

478
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,919
companies would be uh what should they

479
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,840
actually prioritize and how do they

480
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,120
build an ecosystem which the end user

481
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,340
can trust right so some of these key

482
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,980
factor has helped us achieve um and

483
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,559
there has been a mass support from the

484
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,120
government from The Regulators from the

485
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,980
banks that we partner with and of course

486
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,380
all the affluent customers that we have

487
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,640
on our platform

488
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,740
so I think these are the few things that

489
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,179
possibly I will try to cover during the

490
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,280
whole session

491
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,720
so these are my takeaways that I have

492
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,700
learned in last four years at my current

493
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,840
job

494
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,340
over to you sir

495
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,860
so I think one of the

496
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,760
observations or criticisms has been that

497
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,340
The Regulators are slow to take note of

498
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,340
a trend and provide clear guidance as to

499
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,620
how new technologies can be used right

500
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,700
so in banking of course the regulator

501
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,120
always had Outsourcing guidelines and uh

502
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,880
it was not clear whether Cloud

503
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,460
Outsourcing is covered or not then RBI

504
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,720
came up with low data localization

505
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,780
requirements which had an impact on

506
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,299
cloud services and so on as you might

507
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,500
know in June 2022 this year RBI came out

508
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,100
with draft guidelines on it Outsourcing

509
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,440
and which has a separate annexure on

510
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,480
cloud Outsourcing and it talks about the

511
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,299
whole life cycle about how a vendor to

512
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:12,140
be selected uh what kind of

513
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,940
configurations the vendor must have how

514
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,799
there should be compliance with privacy

515
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,140
data sovereignty and other requirements

516
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,299
and how an exit strategies also to be

517
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,860
planned which many times people don't

518
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,220
really think about and uh all that is

519
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,900
covered so hopefully these guidelines

520
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,059
will soon get formalized as Master

521
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,000
directions but uh I want to ask Naveen

522
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,620
one question about

523
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,380
um uh so the uh many of the regulated

524
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,960
entities have multiple regulations to

525
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,320
comply with uh so what is the what is

526
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,720
your own approach on how to reduce the

527
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,179
compliance burden by harmonizing the

528
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,220
regulations to the extent possible and

529
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,159
what would you uh advise companies about

530
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,020
meeting the compliance requirements in

531
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,200
general

532
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,059
thank you

533
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,059
hello

534
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,400
[Music]

535
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,919
see as far as NCI PC is concerned we are

536
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,419
the National nodal body for protection

537
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,460
of the critical information

538
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,600
infrastructure in the country

539
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,059
and uh

540
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,940
our stand has been uh

541
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,600
to help the uh

542
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,220
the critical information for structure

543
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,220
entities adopt technology for the sake

544
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,460
of efficiency and

545
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,940
um complying to the security should not

546
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,159
make them derived of the benefits of the

547
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,500
technology so we are have always been

548
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,120
quite open to the adoption of cloud

549
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,740
technology and

550
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,980
the any other technology and

551
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,900
We have basically said that you should

552
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,380
be uh quite aware of the the technology

553
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,360
what it offers what are the risks

554
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,860
associated with it

555
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,960
and once you understand the risks you

556
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,880
should

557
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,539
have adequate risk mitigation policy you

558
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,520
should have adequate controls to ensure

559
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,320
that

560
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,539
security is there

561
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,480
and regarding easing the compliance

562
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,000
burden as far as the ncipc is concerned

563
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,059
we have entities in all the seven

564
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,820
critical sectors that is the banking

565
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,559
financial services and in Insurance

566
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,559
sector power and energy sector or

567
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,299
whether it is the government sector the

568
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,220
Strategic and public Enterprises sector

569
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,940
then we have the transport sector so in

570
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
all these uh sectors there are already

571
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,840
Regulators available and we are trying

572
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,580
to work with the regulator so that the

573
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,700
compliance borders doesn't increase and

574
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,760
we we try to operate through the uh

575
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,740
regulators and in some of the cases

576
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,299
where we are seeing that the critical

577
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,919
information infrastructure entities are

578
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,539
having to do a lot of

579
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,539
audits to comply to various guidelines

580
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,220
we we are now working with The

581
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,919
Regulators to ensure that in one or two

582
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,659
audits all the compliances which are

583
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,880
required if they can be a mapped and a

584
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,860
one or two audit should be sufficient so

585
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,320
that they don't have to engage into a

586
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,620
lot of compliance Audits and my emphasis

587
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,919
always has been uh to to also look

588
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,440
Beyond compliance and our

589
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,080
policy in short is is to to be able to

590
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,500
enable the CSO and to empower them so

591
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,120
that their voices are heard they have

592
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,980
the required resources they have they

593
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,659
get the required resources both in terms

594
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,179
of Manpower and in terms of the the

595
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,940
technology which they need but our

596
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,159
advice always has been to the to this

597
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,260
resource to be to be totally aware of

598
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,200
the things to be to aware of what they

599
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,820
are Outsourcing and and what kind of

600
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,159
control should be there what they are

601
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,140
doing so that they are able to supervise

602
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,860
them uh properly so that kind of of a

603
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,600
minimum Talent base should be there

604
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,419
within the uh csos of the critical

605
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,159
information infrastructure entities so

606
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,460
that they are able to oversee whatever

607
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,679
has been outsourced so that has been the

608
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,380
general approach of ncipc and we have

609
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,240
critical information infrastructure

610
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,159
entities who are with critical

611
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,320
applications are also on the on the

612
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,659
cloud and we have helped them in doing

613
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,539
the risk assessment properly and we have

614
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,400
suggested additional controls which are

615
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,919
required to make it more safe and to

616
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,020
reduce their attack surface so that is

617
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,020
how we are going in a general sir and

618
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,779
the same approach remains as far as the

619
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,720
cloud is concerned also because we do

620
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,779
want the entities to take advantage of

621
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,400
the cloud for example if you take the

622
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,860
stock exchanges for example there are a

623
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,140
lot of stock extra small stock exchanges

624
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,779
or a lot of Brokers and others who have

625
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:46,860
to uh

626
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,559
who basically interact with the Mis and

627
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,860
unless those are also secured they they

628
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,080
always pose a threat to the to the

629
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,640
through the stock exchanges or to the

630
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,580
market uh infrastructure institutions so

631
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,460
when we think in terms of enabling them

632
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,980
then then we do uh have to think in

633
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,080
terms of moving to some kind of a shared

634
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,539
resources and there again the the

635
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,640
provision of stock services or CM

636
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,000
Services through the cloud and all their

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,159
uh more uh commercially viable options

638
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,020
and uh we are there to do whatever uh is

639
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,240
possible so that this is actually

640
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,120
adopted and and the overall security of

641
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,460
the cyberspace of the Indian entities

642
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,159
that that increases thank you I think

643
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,679
that that's great to know uh I wanted to

644
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,320
ask Ganesh from his past experience

645
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,240
would you have any learnings to share

646
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,240
about how this Cloud journey is to be

647
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,820
done especially uh prioritization of

648
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,419
applications or any uh hybrid user Cloud

649
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,720
any security related things to keep in

650
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,840
mind

651
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,600
yeah

652
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
so basically based on our experience

653
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,520
which is probably highly limited because

654
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,260
it's only days because they are also

655
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,360
kind of wanting to adopt a very very

656
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,460
calibrated gradual approach onto the

657
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,539
cloud

658
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,299
some of the things that we have realized

659
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,779
is that the skills area becomes

660
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,720
extremely important

661
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,460
particularly in companies like ours

662
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,919
unlike uh let's say born in the cloud

663
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,440
kind of companies that uh himanshu

664
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,039
represents uh in our case uh you have

665
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,919
experience but the experience is in in a

666
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,779
different context in the data center Etc

667
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,480
so the skills in terms of whether you

668
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,460
whether it is a mix of skills that you

669
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,200
train or whether whether it's a mix of

670
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,700
skills that you acquire from the market

671
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,159
and then take those kind of people I

672
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,779
think the skills are going to become an

673
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,820
important element in the cloud Journey

674
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,140
that is something that we have really

675
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,120
learned and obviously I think that

676
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,340
applies to anybody who is trying to get

677
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,539
onto the cloud

678
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,760
and of course some of the other things

679
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,880
that we are discovering is that one has

680
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,000
to be very very clear about the kind of

681
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,500
cloud Arrangement that you are getting

682
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,900
into with clear roles and

683
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,779
responsibilities not only between let's

684
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,480
say the bank or the company and the

685
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,580
cloud service provider but also with

686
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,679
various other intermediaries which may

687
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,940
be involved whether it may be your

688
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,159
software provider or whether some of

689
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,659
your other partners who are implementing

690
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,700
so the understanding the roles and

691
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,440
responsibilities and being very clear I

692
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,919
think avoids a lot of issues later

693
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,659
and the other thing which is a little

694
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,640
more tactical probably for some of the

695
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,260
practitioners or some of the people who

696
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,840
are there in the audience quite often we

697
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,240
get carried away by this nomenclature of

698
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,279
whether something is an IIs Arrangement

699
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,740
or a pass Arrangement uh increasingly we

700
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,299
are discovering that

701
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,480
the actual arrangements which you do or

702
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,580
actual projects which you when you start

703
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,260
running them particularly when they are

704
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,480
very large projects quite often may not

705
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,700
necessarily fitting completely with IAS

706
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,740
completely with pass they may have some

707
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,059
mix of everything

708
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,400
so the the most important thing for

709
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,260
practitioners to look at particularly

710
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,740
from a security clearance or security

711
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,539
checking angle is to not go by these

712
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,120
nomenclature don't get them kind of into

713
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,700
your head and get allow them to disturb

714
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,279
your thought process but move go more

715
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,620
from the point of view of understanding

716
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,679
the end-to-end data and traffic flow and

717
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,419
then make sure that your controls are

718
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,059
aligned with that basically wherever you

719
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,919
are supposed to be responsible for the

720
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,080
particular part of the traffic then you

721
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,279
should have complete visibility and

722
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:35,159
control and vice versa quite often this

723
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:37,919
is where sometimes very large projects

724
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,500
very complex architectural based

725
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,200
projects get into trouble where

726
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,480
you meaning you get lost in this

727
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,000
terminology of IAS pass etc etc and you

728
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,799
are not able to actually assess

729
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,419
um very objectively I think that is

730
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,700
something that we should all look at we

731
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,840
should not simply go by this

732
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,220
terminologies because they can be very

733
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,679
confusing because as for example you

734
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,899
will discover that some of the very

735
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,600
large SAS platforms have a good good

736
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,179
element of fast built in them they give

737
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,620
you connectors where you can actually

738
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,320
develop a lot of stuff on a past basis

739
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,539
and then those will run practically

740
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,520
seamlessly along with the SAS offering

741
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,799
so if you don't handle that accordingly

742
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,960
then you will kind of you will simply

743
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,820
blindly treat it as fast and not have

744
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,679
the right kind of control so this this

745
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,440
is something that as we go along we are

746
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,620
also learning and the other thing is uh

747
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,500
this is a very kind of a

748
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,720
counterintuitive thing that as you do

749
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,059
more cloud has to do more agile I would

750
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,440
say that you need to be even more

751
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,740
disciplined so this is not uh quite

752
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,659
often we think that when you want to be

753
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,000
Innovative you can just go like you can

754
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,120
swing your bat closing your eyes then in

755
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,679
fact what will end up end up happening

756
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,159
is that you will really not hit anything

757
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,600
you will not only get not get out maybe

758
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,700
you'll end up wasting a lot of balls and

759
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,159
asking rate will only go up but what is

760
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,320
more important is with cloud with some

761
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
of these agile things I think that

762
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,799
little plane becomes even more important

763
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,380
I think people will have to seriously

764
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,260
look at this Landing Zone standardized

765
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,299
Cloud architecture kind of constructs

766
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,520
before they go in so that the later

767
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,559
movements become much easier because you

768
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,620
put a solid superstructure or solid

769
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,260
foundation by way of creating a good

770
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,779
base architecture and Landing Zone and

771
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,480
all of that so that you can move 20

772
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,240
projects to 40 Projects 60 projects

773
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,120
without kind of having to assess each

774
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,860
one of them independently because that

775
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,840
becomes much easier whereas if you don't

776
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,220
have that then every single project

777
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,799
becomes a new thing and uh we are all

778
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,419
going to be kind of running around all

779
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:43,380
the time

780
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,100
and last uh before I kind of wind up on

781
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,740
this question uh I think one of the

782
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,600
things that we have also learned is from

783
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,880
a from a security monitoring perspective

784
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,640
we also have to look at what is the

785
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,940
right level of monitoring that you need

786
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,200
particularly in terms of distinguishing

787
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,120
between what will come as part of the

788
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,640
Native cloud service tools vis-a-vis

789
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,320
what will come as generic tools because

790
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,840
there are both the pluses and minuses

791
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,080
there are some advantages of generic

792
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,460
tools because you can see probably

793
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,919
multiple clouds in one place whereas

794
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,919
indicator in the case of native

795
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:21,299
monitoring tools probably you will have

796
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,520
more preventive ability Etc which I

797
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,799
think himanshu will know even better so

798
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,299
these are these are things that at least

799
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,820
I thought some things that we are

800
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,460
learning along the way and probably for

801
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,820
people to be kind of conscious of when

802
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,159
they get on with their Cloud Journey

803
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,520
I think uh what Ganesh is saying is very

804
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,039
relevant because we continue to have

805
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,159
these uh instances of uh you know

806
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,620
breaches in the cloud and uh probably

807
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,020
this advice would be very useful so we

808
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,640
are kind of approaching the end of the

809
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,500
session but uh I wanted to get the

810
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,320
audience questions in uh so if anyone

811
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,440
has any question kindly state your name

812
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,559
and uh

813
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,880
one of the batteries can take the

814
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,740
question

815
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,580
at the back

816
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,260
foreign

817
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,210
[Music]

818
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,659
how often do you

819
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:46,679
know

820
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,279
back

821
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,860
the business system or

822
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,899
if you're talking about clouds will you

823
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,019
also acknowledge

824
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:08,059
without head postures uh

825
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,540
see um the the meaty policy is also in

826
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,560
is already in place regarding the

827
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,239
adoption of clouds by the government

828
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,540
entities and and even the the public

829
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,179
sector entities so so most of these uh

830
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,480
entities who are CII they belong to

831
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,780
these categories so they can take the

832
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,080
cloud services only of the uh empaneled

833
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,139
cloud service providers so these

834
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,000
embaneled cloud service providers the

835
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,918
the they can provide you cloud services

836
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,820
in in three different uh deployment ways

837
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,859
one of them is the private Cloud the

838
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,199
other is the one is the public Cloud the

839
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,820
second is the virtual library cloud and

840
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,560
the last one is the government Community

841
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,900
Cloud so most of these Services is from

842
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,720
the government Community clouds and meti

843
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,240
does have a fairly extensive audit by

844
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,180
sdqc before and paneling that cloud

845
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,660
service provider to provide services to

846
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,099
the government entities to move to the

847
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,579
cloud so a basic level of security is

848
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,440
definitely ensured

849
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,440
and then that then when we look at these

850
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,680
entities we we first look at what

851
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,300
exactly is the kind of services it is

852
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,500
taking from the cloud is it

853
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,119
infrastructure as a service or is it

854
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,619
software as a service

855
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,320
and depending upon that we look what

856
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,520
kind of

857
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,740
security related responsibility lies

858
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,660
with the cloud service provider what is

859
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,940
with the uh

860
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,599
entity and whether there is any Gap in

861
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,540
that or not so those kinds of risks

862
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,680
whether they have been properly

863
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,500
identified and whether appropriate

864
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,660
mitigation measures are there that is

865
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,359
what we definitely uh look at of course

866
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,780
in the long run uh we may like to put on

867
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,579
additional controls on the crowd service

868
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,160
providers wherever it is required but we

869
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,200
would like to focus more on uh

870
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,839
technology related

871
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,280
controls for the cloud service providers

872
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,800
where where the encryption probably is

873
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,420
done in such a way that the key is in

874
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,760
your control so that the cloud service

875
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,800
provider is not able to have a look at

876
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,740
their data and things like that and and

877
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,839
I think the key is is how do you do the

878
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,760
identity and the access management

879
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,980
because if that is done properly then

880
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,140
that also reduces a lot of risk and then

881
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,420
of course as Ganesh was talking about

882
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,920
the monitoring part what is being

883
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,720
monitored by the cloud service provider

884
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,820
and what you should monitor there should

885
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,339
not be any Gap and at times the two

886
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,780
should be looked together so whether

887
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,339
that is being done or not that is what

888
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,040
we looked look at and I I at what

889
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,800
frequency do we do so that we have our

890
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
own

891
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,119
systems depending upon the the

892
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,040
criticality of that particular critical

893
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,780
information infrastructure we decide the

894
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,119
periodicity and depending upon other

895
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,700
information if some incident etcetera

896
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,839
has happened or something has been

897
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,000
reported then maybe that gets more

898
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,260
attention and things like that

899
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,000
so we are talking about financial

900
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,940
inclusion for cloud services uh in

901
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,839
today's scenario right where we have the

902
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,119
profileration of digital economy where

903
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,740
we have more number of users who are

904
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,079
using uh Digital Services for Banking

905
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,599
and other related Services right and we

906
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,859
were talking about saying that more of

907
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,720
affluent users would be where we would

908
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,980
be targeting and then we would be making

909
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,680
uh these services but in today's

910
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,380
scenario where we talk about when we say

911
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,820
Financial inclusion we have a lot of

912
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,760
people uh even from a rural area people

913
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,859
who are from the lower background right

914
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,300
who started using digital banking

915
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,980
because they were people who had not

916
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,359
introduced to these kind of Technologies

917
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,280
were not using these things and now we

918
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,200
are suddenly exposed and now the banking

919
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,820
sector is also exposed to these kind of

920
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,740
people who may not have these kind of

921
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,540
technical knowledge or know how to how

922
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,700
to protect themselves because we see a

923
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,680
lot of phishing attacks or malware

924
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,359
attacks like people are getting calls

925
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,680
and then saying that okay can you share

926
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,420
me or OTP pin and things like that right

927
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,420
so where we are the banking systems is

928
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,339
now very vulnerable because people it is

929
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,099
not that people who have technology

930
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,540
technically Savvy who can use the

931
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,859
banking services or a smartphone or

932
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,240
anything like that we have people who

933
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,619
have no clue what they are doing on the

934
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,420
system they just know I'll receive an

935
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,920
OTP and then I probably need to share it

936
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,480
with someone or use it on the system or

937
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,300
things like that so how equipped are we

938
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,220
to handle these kind of situations

939
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,560
because when we say digital inclusion we

940
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,780
need to focus on people like them as

941
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,060
well no I get what you're saying uh

942
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,060
unfortunately the answer is is out of

943
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,200
scope in this topic but yeah since uh is

944
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,300
there I'll try to answer because I was

945
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,700
the node loss of a cyber crime in

946
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,579
jharkhand as well as far as this

947
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,740
financial inclusion is concerned what my

948
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,920
co-panelist said uh was about affluent

949
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,480
sections because he dealt with a product

950
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,980
which deals with affluent section of the

951
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,540
society otherwise these evalots and all

952
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,000
they basically deal with the people who

953
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,880
are at the grassroot levels and and so

954
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
so the majority of the financial

955
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,660
inclusion which the government is

956
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,820
focusing is on is is to bring those

957
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,579
deprived sections uh to have access to

958
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,220
these and how do you ensure the cyber

959
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,280
security and all I think the the the the

960
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,780
education of the masses who are using

961
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,480
this that that is the key and and a lot

962
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,280
of initiatives are being taken in this

963
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,740
regard apart from that there are regular

964
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,599
interactions between the law enforcement

965
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,760
agencies and The Regulators where the

966
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,260
law enforcement agencies if they find

967
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,000
some loopholes and some extra

968
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,040
regulations to be put in place so that

969
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,780
is passed on to the regulators and The

970
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Regulators then try to uh to close those

971
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,820
security loopholes for example if you

972
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,460
look at the last three four years now if

973
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,020
you have a check transaction above a

974
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,579
particular value you get a call from the

975
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,099
bank and they verify it you when you get

976
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,380
credit cards they are disabled for

977
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,940
international payments all those

978
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,740
security controls could be put in place

979
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,540
because of this feedback mechanism and

980
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,099
the government is quite aware of

981
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:07,859
the fact that we have to make these

982
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,440
transactions secure for this for for

983
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,599
this ecosystem to be actually used by

984
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,099
the people and the mha has made this i4c

985
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,000
which is uh which which records all

986
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,579
kinds of cyber crime online they analyze

987
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:24,960
the kind of crimes which are taking

988
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,660
place and what necessary technical

989
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,520
controls can be done of course apart

990
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,920
from the the legal side of it where you

991
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,320
track The Gangs which are involved they

992
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,240
have formed Interstate teams which track

993
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,859
these gangs so that they are taken to

994
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,660
task but at the same time what level of

995
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,359
more technical controls can be built in

996
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,460
so that these kinds of frauds doesn't

997
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,680
take place that is very much on the

998
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,300
agenda and a lot of things have taken

999
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,280
place in in that direction also

1000
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,140
I will I'll just add that tomorrow there

1001
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,500
is a session on this problem the retail

1002
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,300
cyber crime from the user's point of

1003
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,579
view uh kindly take a look and you may

1004
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,079
want to attend so I think we are

1005
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,700
completely out of time and I'm getting

1006
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,380
uh repeated reminders from the

1007
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,180
organizers to wrap it up one question

1008
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,839
okay yeah so my name is darshan so this

1009
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,540
is more towards uh Financial inclusion

1010
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,079
uh being simplified with Cloud uh Native

1011
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,020
platforms that are available and uh the

1012
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,000
question is more towards how is Indian

1013
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,460
government looking at it because uh we

1014
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,119
are talking about here and do we also

1015
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,619
plan to have our own cloud

1016
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,839
infrastructure and uh I know that there

1017
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,000
was something on make that was happening

1018
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,220
so are we trying to do something around

1019
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,680
that where we don't depend on the awss

1020
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,740
or the Azure or the gcps and we build

1021
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,720
our own and so that we are much more

1022
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,940
isolated from these Global platforms and

1023
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,640
uh where do we see ourselves

1024
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,660
see I think if you look at all the 18

1025
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,859
cloud service providers which are

1026
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,020
embeddled by meti most of them are the

1027
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,180
Indian Cloud entities only

1028
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,040
so government of India is doing its bit

1029
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,859
to ensure that we promote the Indian

1030
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,660
cloud service providers and they also

1031
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,160
have a global presence in the long run

1032
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,780
all right thank you so I just want to

1033
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,820
