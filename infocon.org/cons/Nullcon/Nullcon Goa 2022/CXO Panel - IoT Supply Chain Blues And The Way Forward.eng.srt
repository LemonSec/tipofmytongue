1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,120
good evening everyone

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,880
yes yes thank you

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,639
all right I promise I will try to keep

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,160
it interesting because normally I don't

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,379
attend any pen I've never attended a

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,119
panel session because I don't like panel

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,300
sessions but uh if my company tells me I

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,859
have to do a panel session then I have

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,420
to do a van in session

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,599
so I'll try and keep it fun light

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
so

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,140
so we I've been working on iot for a

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,880
long time now specifically around

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,420
security testing and

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,480
it is messy you know because the the

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,059
attack surface for specifically for iot

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,879
is huge I mean it's not like just one

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,440
mobile application that you have to

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,200
assess it is the hardware it is the

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,239
firmware it is the radio communication

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
it is the cloud it is the mobile it is

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
the web everything combined

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
so

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,480
ah so obviously we get a lot of

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,900
customers who want us to test their

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,600
products and you know I kept on

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
wondering how how is it that you know

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,180
product manufacturers manage uh their

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,320
security

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,500
given that uh you know they're not the

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,380
end manufacturers it is all supply chain

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,580
specifically for iot so when I say iot I

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,580
say it in a very loose term uh I'm I'm

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,200
talking about anything which is

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,259
connected so for me iot is connected

36
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,680
cars industrial devices home automation

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
Healthcare

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,659
and yeah and anything basically which is

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,479
connected so yeah so my company told me

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,939
to do a panel and I thought let's get

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,840
all uh the best uh gentlemen from uh

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
different domains in uh in in iot

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,899
specifically manufacturers and Grill

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,720
them about the uh how do they manage

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,039
supply chain issues

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,619
all right so let's start uh what we'll

47
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,959
do is we'll keep it like a standard

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,840
format question answers I'll try not to

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,540
embarrass them but feel free to take

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,879
notes and Grill them uh in the end I

51
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,500
can't do it right because there are

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,080
guests

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,640
all right so what we'll do is we'll

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,580
start with one minute introduction

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,760
um uh for everyone and then uh their

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,760
take on uh iot supply chain security

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,360
issues so let's start uh with sudarshan

58
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,739
hi everyone uh

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,700
I know when you have a speaker like that

60
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,800
I don't know what to say right so my

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,959
name is sudarshan Raj gopal uh I am

62
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,180
representing shell here I'm I work for

63
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,519
Shell uh as a cc manager which is

64
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,860
compliance manager for uh sorry

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,260
competency Center manager for security

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,080
and compliance uh that's that's the

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,420
domain where I work with uh in the

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,340
industry where we are and of course as

69
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,260
you see uh from a larger perspective

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,900
just to give like a quick thought on iot

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,080
and in supply chain so I think

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,120
right now like everything is getting

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,760
connected uh the Legacy to the next gen

74
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,700
and with us with a single switch you can

75
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,440
do a lot of things I think the security

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,780
plays a Paramount role and that's where

77
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,300
I'm more keen to learn from you and the

78
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,120
fellow panelists uh about what it is and

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
to probably impart what I have learned

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
from there that's that's the idea why

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,300
I'm here

82
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,200
thank you

83
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,800
um

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
my name is

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
I am the CSO for nxp semiconductors it's

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,379
a

87
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,500
specialist security Focus silicon

88
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,360
manufacturer and solutions company that

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,940
you may not have heard of but I bet you

90
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,580
pretty much every mobile device you use

91
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,280
pretty much all the iconic cars that you

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,860
know of and pretty much all the carriers

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,900
that carry your signals I mean we are

94
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,459
there

95
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,980
um it's a exciting business especially

96
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,680
this time of our technology Evolution

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,299
and everything that's happening around

98
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,560
us

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,519
so to me supply chain iot supply chain

100
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,858
security is very very close to her both

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,199
from our poor business as well as in my

102
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,139
role as the ciso and I think

103
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,199
we are here talking about it

104
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,639
because

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,160
in spite of all our experience with

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,139
supply chain and supply chain security

107
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,440
and supply chain integrity

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,320
years of experience

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,320
we have still managed to get iot supply

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,259
chain wrong again

111
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,800
right and that is why it is an issue

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,580
and at its core it boils down to this

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,800
that when procurement or the fun

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,240
procuring organizations by anything to

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,860
do with iot

116
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,220
their lights twinkle with cheap

117
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,500
and generic

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,960
20 cent Parts one dollar Parts two

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,340
dollar parts

120
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,280
whereas the reality is most iot

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,100
components now are connected

122
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,080
they have fairly decent amount of

123
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
compute they have storage and they often

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,540
have an in incomplete Network stack

125
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,220
built in right so it's a recipe for

126
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,320
disaster and the disaster is upon us

127
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,500
today

128
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
hey good afternoon

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,650
I almost feel like I'm sitting

130
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,380
[Music]

131
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,060
so I always feel like I'm sitting for an

132
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,139
exam with a seam as my teacher

133
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,460
they keep walking around and while he

134
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,180
asks

135
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,220
rambling to write I almost get that

136
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,479
feeling so uh my name is anant I am from

137
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
Johnson Controls and I'm part of the

138
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
global product security team uh I handle

139
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,800
the Assurance testing function within

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,580
Johnson Controls so for me uh iot supply

141
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,259
chain is

142
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,320
a very critical aspect because when we

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,180
get a device to be tested the

144
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,080
components actually come in from

145
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,520
multiple uh sources there is no uh one

146
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,500
single uh Source from where the product

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,240
is delivered so either the board is

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,520
assembled somewhere it is integrated by

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,560
somebody and then it kind of comes to us

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,840
for testing so when we actually go ahead

151
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,880
and do the testing we find there are too

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,100
many issues while we look at it from a

153
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,660
individual component perspective

154
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,819
probably there wouldn't be a much of a

155
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,560
problem but when we look at an

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,400
integration of multiple uh points it

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,919
leads to a lot of issues and that in

158
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,639
turn causes a lot of

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,259
ripples across so I think my aim is to

160
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,880
kind of look at I mean we have panels

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,979
from uh the Semiconductor in the

162
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,100
industry from the medical side from the

163
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,340
energy side so try to understand how do

164
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,160
we kind of as a industry kind of look at

165
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,680
uh mitigating it or trying to get a

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,220
handle on some of these issues

167
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,960
thank you

168
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,880
uh hey everyone I'm kedar senior

169
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,560
director of engineering for expressive

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,440
systems uh I'm sure many of you might

171
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,160
have hacked on the esp32 or esp8266

172
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,660
those are the kind of devices that we

173
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,480
make for me

174
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,360
[Music]

175
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,960
um

176
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,319
the iot in supply chain is some a very

177
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,060
critical component that we need to look

178
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,880
at because as more devices get connected

179
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,180
around us uh we see presidents wearing

180
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,759
smart watches uh and you know their

181
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,620
heartbeats are being sent or to Some

182
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,020
Cloud Server somewhere so you know even

183
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,120
before the meeting ends which direction

184
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
the meeting is going right and there's a

185
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,099
lot of attention being given on the

186
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,139
cloud side security of things and the

187
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,840
penetration testing of things but what

188
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,120
iot security in the supply chain means

189
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,699
is that how are the devices assembled

190
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,199
and

191
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,639
what are the parts of the supply chain

192
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,560
that are completely untrusted and how

193
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,860
can we as an industry ensure that there

194
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,039
are technological solutions that ensure

195
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,599
that it is just impossible for people to

196
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,620
fake these or introduce uh you know

197
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,639
malwares or exploits into these and the

198
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
other part of it that I also deeply care

199
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,320
about is how we can do this at because

200
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,539
everything comes at a price but how we

201
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,599
can do this at an as much level of

202
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,339
affordability that even a smart light

203
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,740
bulb that you have in your house that

204
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,260
you probably bought for 400 500 bucks

205
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,320
has the same level of security Assurance

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,480
as some of the other more sensitive

207
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,019
components

208
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,060
all right great thank you

209
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,420
so uh uh my name is Sachin Jen and I'm

210
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,060
uh having more than 21 years of

211
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,339
experience in the industry including uh

212
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,980
consumer electronics automobile medical

213
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,140
devices Amit with Striker for more than

214
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,580
11 years

215
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,040
and uh

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,839
probably mind plus years into the

217
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,300
security and uh

218
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,320
some of my uh area of interest is like

219
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
section attacks uh import injections and

220
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,300
uh

221
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,120
laser attacks and binary version so

222
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,760
basically I mean those are

223
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,760
something I mean which gives me life and

224
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
uh uh I'm more than happy to be part of

225
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
this panel and uh here to contribute uh

226
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,959
whatever best I can and learn from

227
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,660
everybody here and uh of course like

228
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,060
what I got a feeling is uh

229
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,860
like uh

230
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,240
in a movie sholay like

231
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,100
I was going to say that that's kind of

232
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,019
feeling I am getting like that's how

233
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,779
Asim is looking like at us right now but

234
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:01,560
yeah

235
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
um really uh thanks to uh see him at the

236
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,380
nelcon team uh and uh more than happy to

237
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,560
be answer any of uh your questions here

238
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,779
all right thank you and welcome all of

239
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,120
you all right let's take a step back and

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,740
let's first

241
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,760
um

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,540
answer the question that are is supply

243
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,240
chain actually a real threat or are they

244
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,100
like whims and fancies of people like

245
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,720
you know part two or companies like

246
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,480
pirate who sell their services and uh

247
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,060
products

248
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,380
let's start with you so

249
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,540
personally I feel it is a very very

250
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,120
valid issue and it's not like it's going

251
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,000
to happen it's already happening now

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,480
there have been uh a lot of coverage a

253
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,100
couple of years back we had the target

254
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,339
uh attacks now if you look at from where

255
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,000
it actually uh originated it was from an

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,440
HVAC provider so it is not about uh

257
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,300
whether it is going to happen we are

258
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,339
already there year on year we are

259
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,800
looking at uh somewhere around as per

260
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,660
last year statistics we are looking at

261
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,700
around

262
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,600
217 percent increase in uh on attacks on

263
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,079
the iot devices so it's high time we

264
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,060
start taking this seriously I think we

265
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,000
are already there we need to have uh as

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,040
an industry look at uh

267
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
uh clubbing our thought processes and

268
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,079
putting something together I think

269
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,019
that's where we are already

270
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,459
so um

271
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,140
you're right it's

272
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,820
already a threat

273
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,560
and um

274
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,040
it's a real threat for a number of

275
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
reasons let me list two

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,380
one is just the sheer proliferation of

277
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,019
iot devices I mean it we already have a

278
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,180
billion mobile phones computers and

279
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,459
these are all five hundred dollar to

280
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,220
thousand dollar Parts but industrial iot

281
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,940
are all as I said for 25 30 35 parts so

282
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,620
you can imagine the pace at which

283
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,360
industrial iot is proliferating

284
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,500
the second reason why it is a problem

285
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,720
is because when you look at industrial

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,480
iot there are typically two things they

287
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,600
can do many of them can do that when you

288
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,640
talk about consumer iot like phones and

289
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,339
computer it comes your connected devices

290
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,560
like phones and stuff they don't

291
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,140
one is many of those can sense

292
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,600
right they have sensors built in there's

293
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,000
a sensing functionality so if you can

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,320
compromise

295
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
a sensing device set of sensing devices

296
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,480
you can get access to pretty much

297
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,360
real-time feed of sensing data

298
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,700
but much worse

299
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,459
is that many industrial iot devices are

300
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,339
set up to be actuating devices

301
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,040
it can as a part of its functionality

302
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,500
actuate something start your car engine

303
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,139
remotely so you should switch it off

304
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,660
turn the machine on remotely switch it

305
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,720
off make industrial robots go a certain

306
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,540
way do a certain thing and again when

307
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,820
you're talking about compromise

308
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,120
how much would you really pay to make

309
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,760
this thing go away right so and that

310
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,839
limit

311
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
is not a function of the value of that

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,279
40 asset right it's a function of your

313
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,320
how much business loss you can really

314
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,399
bear

315
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,019
and that's going to be a lot of losses

316
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,500
and that day unfortunately is almost

317
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,660
upon us right and that's why it's a

318
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,560
problem actually uh recent I just read a

319
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,380
few days back a McKinsey report we are

320
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,519
looking at uh by 2030

321
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,980
economy worth

322
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,339
ranging from 5.5 trillion dollars to

323
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,680
10.5 trillion dollars that is going to

324
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,500
be enabled by iot so you can just

325
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,399
imagine the sheer scale for anyone to

326
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,820
kind of uh play around with

327
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,180
but that is the uh

328
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,820
what you can say the Spectrum of what is

329
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,480
going to be enabled by iot

330
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
it almost takes me back to the days of

331
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,200
uh Windows NT I don't know how many of

332
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,240
you remember this but NT stood for

333
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,740
Network Technology right those were the

334
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,019
operating systems were networking just

335
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,540
came into uh operating systems right

336
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,060
that was that was the time today we are

337
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,579
saying iot because we say Internet is

338
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,220
just getting into things but I think

339
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,720
after a few years it'll just be things

340
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,339
we don't even know which of them are

341
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,660
network connected which of them are not

342
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,560
so it's uh to your point the the scale

343
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,300
of devices that are connected to the

344
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,279
internet becomes significantly larger

345
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,040
and as soon mentioned it directly has an

346
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,320
impact because it affects the physical

347
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,779
world it's not just you know oh my hard

348
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,519
disk is corrupted but it affects a

349
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,199
physical world it can start five years

350
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,699
it can lock you out of your house and

351
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,399
things like that so it becomes all the

352
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,040
more uh important for us to look at it

353
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
with sufficient attention and you know

354
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,199
guidelines

355
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,079
yep uh I completely agree with the with

356
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,360
the panel here and uh I believe medical

357
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,820
is no more different uh than what these

358
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,339
guys are looking at right now I mean uh

359
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,040
of course uh Kobe days you know taught

360
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,980
us like uh uh some uh

361
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,040
very highly accelerated uh uh you know

362
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
change in this like uh patient health

363
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
patient safety and uh you know uh the

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,800
parameters or the Pia information or the

365
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,420
data which has been shared over the

366
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,199
Internet so uh uh yeah I mean uh I was

367
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,180
reading like uh probably somewhere like

368
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,560
they're talking like it's a trillion

369
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,620
dollar uh by 2025 or something so it's

370
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,220
pretty much real uh and uh yeah I mean

371
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,980
this this poses some real uh you know uh

372
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,779
threats and the risk which everybody

373
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,360
needs to be aware and think about it

374
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,600
foreign

375
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,760
who are these adversaries and and

376
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,480
the basic idea is what is it that they

377
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,899
gain out of it so seduction I think

378
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,459
that's that's an interesting question

379
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,959
when you talk about who are the

380
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
adversaries and I I can relate this with

381
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,860
something like a gorilla Warfare you do

382
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,540
not know who is the one and you probably

383
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,940
can say so there are State uh which are

384
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,800
sponsoring this there are groups which

385
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,779
are sponsoring this there are people who

386
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,339
want to make money out of it are doing

387
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,220
it there are different uh kind of people

388
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,980
now I mean if I may code the examples of

389
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,500
say you're at Colonial pipe which which

390
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,940
went through something like this you had

391
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,199
solar winds which went through something

392
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,519
like this and we might talk about it

393
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,259
somewhere in the in the course of the

394
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,720
discussion about these cases but if you

395
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,740
look at it

396
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,920
I think uh for me it would be zero trust

397
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,540
for me it would be like you don't trust

398
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,579
no one everyone can do it so you need to

399
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,240
have a security around it but also a

400
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,519
word of caution and I think we from a

401
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,579
security perspective we also see that we

402
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,680
try to build a Fort Knox everywhere this

403
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
kind of security we want to have it that

404
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,520
because of the fear of unknown we want

405
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,380
to have everything secured to the to the

406
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,480
hill to the T that creates a lot of

407
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,459
overhead a lot of time a lot of problems

408
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,780
so I think

409
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,179
need to know or need to secure kind of a

410
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,980
thing needs to be there but that the

411
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,780
balance has left to an individual and

412
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,608
that's that's the way I would look at it

413
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:21,959
[Music]

414
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,419
anyone else wants

415
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,380
to give their take so I mean uh what ice

416
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,220
would imagine is the from a perpetuator

417
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,740
perspective they are no different from

418
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,860
what we see today in the traditional I.T

419
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,760
world

420
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,360
uh because end of the day uh

421
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,400
it's that's where the money flow is

422
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,320
that's where I can cause maximum

423
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,539
disruption that's where I can uh

424
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:54,660
a nation's economy so with

425
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,080
uh infrastructure or an ecosystem that

426
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
can offer me so many different

427
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,100
possibilities automatically there are

428
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,380
too many groups too many individuals too

429
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,240
many uh entities that can gain uh

430
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,880
benefit from disrupting that entire

431
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,539
ecosystem so the perpetuators are going

432
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,000
to remain the same the intent will be

433
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,140
the same

434
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,080
and that's has been the same will same

435
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,640
will be the same and probably in the

436
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,820
future they will remain the same so I

437
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,780
think the bigger question is that is uh

438
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,000
how do we protect ourselves from it how

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,860
do we protect the larger audience the

440
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,440
consumers to whom we all interact with

441
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,100
how do we protect them them and cause

442
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,620
minimal disruption I think that's the

443
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,640
key point over here yeah so after

444
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,380
getting into iot one of the things that

445
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm very careful about is when I have to

446
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,299
buy something from Amazon because that

447
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,940
is the easiest attack Vector all you

448
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,000
need to do is just put the uh you know

449
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,760
put the back door in the device sell it

450
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,320
in the uh e-market place

451
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,419
all right so next question I'm going to

452
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,600
combine two questions here a what is

453
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,179
missing in the current uh processes

454
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,160
within you know uh the organizations and

455
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,640
how does an effective strategy to combat

456
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,200
supply chain issues looks like

457
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,020
you want to take that

458
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,020
um

459
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,600
there are a couple of very basic things

460
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,179
which are missing from today from the

461
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,760
perspective that Asim talked about

462
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,919
from my point of view

463
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,100
number one is applying the discipline

464
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,160
that we have applied to secure

465
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,559
development life cycles all along at

466
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,179
least in the last 10 years

467
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,059
we need to apply it in iot enabled

468
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,460
Solutions as well right from the

469
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,880
firmware to the application stack which

470
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
is built on top of these iot devices and

471
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,419
often that's not there that's not there

472
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,700
from the large device makers it's not

473
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,799
there from even the custom development

474
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,559
that organizations do themselves

475
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,640
second part of it is the skill

476
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,039
the right training the right people to

477
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,880
be actually doing this this development

478
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,419
and the testing because once you bring

479
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,820
resource constrained items like iot's

480
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,700
into your development mix you need a

481
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,980
completely different kind of mindset to

482
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,640
both develop Code test right I mean

483
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,080
um we are now if you are a cloud

484
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,000
developer you are completely used to

485
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,580
abundance right we don't think of

486
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,320
resource constraint environments at all

487
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,080
anymore right however that's a very very

488
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,600
different paradigm and now if you

489
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,580
building the two together

490
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,580
sensing iot devices at the edge enabled

491
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,740
by Cloud on one you have abundance one

492
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,299
you don't so you know how do you build

493
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,918
build a solution that works

494
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,760
yeah I I think this is very interesting

495
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,660
because

496
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,000
um it goes down to the basic of security

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,940
security is as weak as or as strong as

498
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,940
your weakest link now when you when you

499
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,100
talk about iot in in supply chain

500
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,299
completely

501
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,700
you look at a lot of vendors who

502
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,360
collaborate to bring in a product now uh

503
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,159
for the source company the security

504
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,159
standard might be X for a vendor it

505
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,500
might be X Plus or x minus and that

506
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,659
create and then it also can have a lot

507
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,020
of you know um okay I need to look at my

508
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,120
module and how do I look at my module so

509
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,799
can I get a remote access to the module

510
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,020
to you know fix the bugs or send an

511
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,360
update to my module these are kind of

512
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,080
things which might seep in and that for

513
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,940
me is a bigger challenge to look at it

514
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,679
because now you're looking so earlier it

515
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,780
was one company one tool now your

516
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,400
multi-company and you're like bringing

517
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,860
it together so it's a it's in true world

518
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,600
global village of Global Security what

519
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,880
you're talking about that brings in a

520
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,580
lot of challenges with with the with the

521
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,679
security standard now if I am a service

522
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,840
provider I might be working for 10

523
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,400
different companies so I might have my

524
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,080
standard but those 10 companies might

525
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,520
have different standards so am I

526
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,100
complying to that who is accountable for

527
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,980
that those uh those are the challenges

528
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,559
what I look at I think this this also

529
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,880
brings to an interesting question which

530
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,460
which I usually try and ask is

531
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,280
if something goes wrong uh who's

532
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,419
accountable

533
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,539
say it's an auto auto

534
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:41,520
driven car or at your house like the

535
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,100
HVAC thing happens is it if the third

536
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,380
party gets injured is that the vendor is

537
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,880
that the people who have made it and how

538
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,260
do you look at the legality I think

539
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,120
those are the strategies which you need

540
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,120
to look at uh going forward to to work

541
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,040
on this

542
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,360
[Music]

543
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,659
yeah uh to add to what sudarshan and

544
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,820
Shiva just said

545
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,720
because issue what we have is the sheer

546
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,380
number of uh people involved in uh or

547
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,419
the number of entities that are involved

548
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,059
in putting up an iot device together

549
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:20,039
and uh the biggest issue over here is uh

550
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,360
how much of trust do we uh kind of uh

551
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,240
put on to them in terms of are they

552
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,820
getting their processes right are they

553
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,919
doing the right things before they are

554
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,080
supplying the components to me I think

555
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,380
that's one of the most uh crucial part

556
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,140
that is missing like for example if I

557
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,400
buy a device from uh and uh a vendor a

558
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
he in turn sources uh the board from

559
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
vendor B

560
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,039
finally when I get it in my hand uh do I

561
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,559
have a software bill of materials or a

562
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,080
detailed uh component list as to what

563
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,000
has gone in that Port if I don't have

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,760
that I'm completely tied up and believe

565
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,840
me there are many such uh vendors who

566
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,000
are very quick to uh put things together

567
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,340
I think again would go back to suha's

568
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,360
point over here is the iot industry uh

569
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,280
and the supply chain industry we

570
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,440
actually play a lot on the uh price

571
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,280
point

572
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,620
we don't have the luxury every penny

573
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,620
counts over there so there would be a

574
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,679
few vendors down the chain who might end

575
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,080
up cutting up a few corners and we would

576
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,059
be ending up having those products in

577
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,460
our board but if we don't understand

578
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,460
what is there on the devices it's going

579
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,120
to cause a big problem now on what needs

580
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,100
to be done the

581
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,380
some there are some procedural aspects

582
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,900
or governance aspects that can can be

583
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,340
put in place there are some technical

584
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,620
aspects uh controls that can be put in

585
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,760
place one would be trying to ensure that

586
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,960
uh

587
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,860
we have the right bill of materials from

588
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,260
all the uh vendors who are down

589
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,380
Downstream and we should kind of enforce

590
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,760
or try to push in third party

591
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,340
assessments so that way we can at least

592
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,299
try to maintain some level of uh parity

593
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,220
or to ensure that they are at least

594
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,260
there somewhere we can have some level

595
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,460
of Trust on them

596
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,520
okay yeah no I uh I just try to you know

597
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,919
bring a little bit different angle uh in

598
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,140
a sense that uh you know in this entire

599
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,440
supply chain an iot uh whether it's a

600
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,720
vendor or OEM I mean whosoever it is

601
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,120
basically at the end of the day like I

602
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,240
believe two things uh uh very strongly

603
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,679
impacts so the first thing is uh uh his

604
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,460
attitude about like whether uh it's an

605
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,159
oem I mean are you really thinking

606
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,840
seriously about the security or is this

607
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,720
a checkbox in your process so probably

608
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,820
you know one really needs to think about

609
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,520
it and uh develop a positive attitude

610
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
toward a security now I believe time is

611
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,179
changing and people are becoming more

612
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,820
and more aware and taking these things

613
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,000
um into their processes uh from vendor

614
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,659
side like I mean uh then the deployment

615
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,840
or maybe if it's a it's a OEM I mean the

616
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
deployment how

617
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,200
Engineers are deploying it uh because uh

618
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,480
I mean if you if you talk I mean if if

619
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,039
you think like there's nothing wrong

620
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,620
with AES is encryption right I mean we

621
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,320
all agree to that but uh how it has been

622
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,179
deployed I think that makes a lot of

623
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,240
difference so yeah I mean wherever you

624
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,860
are whatever the role you are playing I

625
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,659
think these two things make a very huge

626
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,159
difference

627
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,460
right so my take is that there is a

628
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,820
silver bullet for solving this problem

629
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,740
and it's not one it's two things

630
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,559
blockchain and AI

631
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,480
can anybody

632
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,159
think why

633
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,960
are these two technologies going to

634
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,679
solve this problem

635
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,880
yeah there are two reasons for it

636
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,400
one is I thought the panel is getting

637
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,419
boring

638
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,760
second is I just wanted to use some tech

639
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,279
jargons because we're taking a video

640
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,840
all right

641
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,799
all right now speaking of tech jargon

642
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:31,460
let's go a bit lower level uh

643
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,980
so tell me how does the security within

644
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,740
the development life cycle look like you

645
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,840
know from a tech perspective you know

646
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,700
what are the real challenges within the

647
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,320
software development okay that you want

648
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,380
to yeah so uh I think uh what's

649
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,960
happening is that uh one good thing is

650
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,059
that there's a lot of attention being uh

651
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,860
given to security as far as firmware

652
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,140
development is concerned and cloud-based

653
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,299
development is concerned uh but uh

654
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,279
security along the supply chain almost

655
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
becomes like an afterthought I think the

656
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,779
first thing is to uh getting sensitized

657
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,720
to the fact that as you are building end

658
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,240
devices uh the supply chain should

659
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,820
completely be untrusted and it's up to

660
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,240
you to say that okay this is my one

661
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,159
point of trust within the supply chain

662
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,380
everything before is untrusted and

663
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,260
everything after is untrusted and once

664
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,240
you start looking at it like that figure

665
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
out what do you want to do at that place

666
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,360
where you put your trust in and I think

667
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,700
a couple of things means that almost

668
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
always uh you know table Stakes always

669
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,220
have to be there is ensuring trusted

670
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,460
boot where only secure firmware is

671
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,880
executing on the devices and that to uh

672
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,360
you know nist approved uh security

673
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,400
mechanisms uh rsa2048 or above or ecdsa

674
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,559
with private keys locked in some safe

675
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,600
somewhere so that it's almost impossible

676
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,039
for people to uh you know replicate

677
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,960
untrusted uh replicate that firmware uh

678
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,760
well run untrusted firmware on the

679
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,539
devices

680
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,140
second is device attestation

681
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,640
where and this is something that you

682
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,440
have to begin because it it becomes part

683
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,779
of the product experience also where

684
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,539
you're saying how does how does my phone

685
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,299
application or my ecosystem validate

686
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,880
that this is really the device that I

687
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,919
made and not a fake device that somebody

688
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,500
made in my name right and it's

689
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,380
potentially uh you know siphoning off

690
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,919
data or doing other things uh and then I

691
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,740
think those two things what essentially

692
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,679
they ensure is that they let you build

693
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,080
trust because now you're looking at it

694
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,419
from the point of view that I'm trying

695
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,919
to solve it by saying everything is

696
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,320
untrusted and I ensure that these

697
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,159
mechanisms uh sort of build the trust

698
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,960
along the way obviously there are other

699
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,140
parts or other additional components

700
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,059
that you will have supplement to this

701
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,880
but this becomes like the very much

702
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,740
Baseline that has to be considered

703
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,620
uh I see I mean I just it's just a funny

704
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,200
uh thing that actually happened at one

705
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,740
of the places where I was working uh he

706
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,179
just mentioned about two zero four right

707
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:20,399
uh bit encryption now the reality is uh

708
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,480
we were handed uh a box uh which we had

709
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,500
to secure it and the decision what

710
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,620
configuration and all we did know we got

711
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,020
it from the business and when we got the

712
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,700
box in our hand we looked at the specs

713
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,100
we couldn't go out with a 64-bit not

714
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,559
even anything more than 64-bit so that's

715
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,779
the reality of the iot world where we

716
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,600
are living in so like uh so again coming

717
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,820
back it's all about money it's all about

718
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,520
dollars and pennies yeah but as I said I

719
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,980
think uh uh

720
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,600
and I think one of the important parts

721
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,640
that we did not consider is uh all of

722
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,220
these things always require some unique

723
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,500
programming on the devices which also

724
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,179
becomes a significant cost Adder because

725
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,100
it's you know manufacturing lines are

726
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,620
much uh geared to building things which

727
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,940
are like you know the same thing gets

728
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,440
burnt on all the devices and it's got

729
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,299
get shipped for many of these things you

730
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,520
require certain unique certificates or

731
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,020
Secrets being programmed which in itself

732
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,720
adds uh to the to the cost but I think

733
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
thankfully today if I look at there are

734
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,539
uh certainly you know as you get to real

735
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,919
fringes Things become tricky but uh if I

736
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,720
go back to my earlier analogy of a light

737
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,340
bulb for example there's a software and

738
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,260
Hardware capability which should ensure

739
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,159
that at least the nist prescribed uh you

740
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,399
know basic crypto has to be uh available

741
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,360
or Beyond I I would say that if you're a

742
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
procuring organization

743
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,080
you we should go back to the good old

744
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,240
virtue of specifications

745
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,919
and

746
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:56,460
um

747
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,799
make sure that the vendor delivers to

748
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,320
those specifications I mean we

749
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,320
are spending enough time in specifying

750
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,419
requirements so that's one I'd say if

751
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,580
you're an organization who is building

752
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,960
the products

753
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,360
then it's if you do it at an Enterprise

754
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,539
scale it's not that difficult to build

755
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,640
in some time for threat modeling for

756
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,059
example specific to that device class

757
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:22,860
and testing

758
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,840
um and I think it's a plug for pi 2 as

759
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,039
well that they have some excellent

760
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,080
testing products for different

761
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,140
classes of iot devices you use those

762
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,200
right and it will not solve everything

763
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,720
but it will surely take care of all the

764
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,620
low hanging roads

765
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,460
okay yeah all right so I I just wanted

766
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,740
to add like uh since haseem is really

767
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,170
interested uh

768
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,679
[Music]

769
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,120
at a lower level right I mean so uh I

770
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,600
mean if you consider uh any iot device

771
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,659
right uh it's a supply chain or whatever

772
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,340
it's going to be I mean it's a part of

773
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,899
like hardware and the software both

774
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,220
right so at the hardware level uh uh

775
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,380
again uh what level of vulnerabilities

776
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,120
and stuffs are there which which could

777
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,919
be inside let's say the Silicon layer at

778
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,260
the Silicon level or the developer has

779
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,659
left something at the board layer or if

780
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,460
you go to the software side whether your

781
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,860
binary has got some some vulnerabilities

782
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,140
inside it or if you go one layer up

783
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,240
which is like your network or a cloud

784
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,840
connectivity so I mean uh right across

785
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,500
all the layers I mean it is really uh

786
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,340
um hard bounded if you just lose one

787
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,539
loophole at any of these uh I believe uh

788
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:46,440
and again unfortunately you know each

789
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,360
organization not everybody can really

790
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,700
have the expert in each individual

791
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,940
domains uh whatever these layers are so

792
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,919
ultimately that's where uh you know

793
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,380
people need to really look out and seek

794
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,779
the help from the external vendors and

795
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,299
the what what has been done outside best

796
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,500
by the best talent

797
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,839
yeah I I think we are probably at a

798
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,300
stage where we were in terms of software

799
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,260
Security in the 80s and 90s like

800
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,418
why why do I need passwords in my

801
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:19,918
internal Network so those kind of things

802
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,839
so we have had conversations with the

803
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,839
companies where you know we talk to them

804
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,359
and they say oh our devices are really

805
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,879
secure and product protected so we ask

806
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,099
how are we using if uh AES 256 okay and

807
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,099
how do you manage the keys what how do

808
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,418
you manage the keys

809
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,940
uh we stored them in the firmware okay

810
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,460
where's your firmware it's in our

811
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,119
external flash

812
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,339
what

813
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,020
oh but why would somebody open their

814
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,199
device

815
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,119
so yeah and and we've we've had multiple

816
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,760
such uh conversations on on different

817
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
aspects all right I think we are running

818
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,420
out of time we have five five minutes

819
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,380
left right so uh let's start with uh two

820
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,480
your two cents on how the future looks

821
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,720
like and then we'll uh ask the audience

822
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,980
to grill you

823
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,220
so from a future perspective I think uh

824
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,780
zero trust

825
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,960
and uh again I'm going to quote again I

826
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,000
see him over here it's very easy he gave

827
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,240
me the answer up ahead so how much we

828
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,839
can leverage AI to uh improve our

829
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,940
predictive capabilities I think these

830
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,780
are some of my two cents on how we can

831
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,960
bring a little bit more security or

832
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,000
bring or embed some more security into

833
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,599
that layer

834
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,720
yeah so

835
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,160
uh sorry to disappoint you ladies and

836
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,200
gentlemen my take on the future is

837
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,500
things will get much worse before it

838
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,200
gets any better that means more business

839
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,040
for us yeah

840
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,040
that went dark quite quickly

841
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,619
no I think I I think I don't look at

842
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,720
gloom and doom I think as he says if the

843
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,099
future is going to be dark then we have

844
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,500
opportunities and we are all together in

845
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,020
there I think the way I look at is yes

846
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,119
the world is going to be connected we

847
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,339
have everything at home now there are

848
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,500
questions on privacy which will improve

849
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,020
there will be so we it's also always a

850
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,240
cat and mouse Chase right so sometimes

851
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,980
we are ahead sometimes they are ahead

852
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,839
but this will happen

853
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,839
my thought is let's look at what the

854
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,180
loopholes what we see how we can have

855
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,680
the process which is stringent how we

856
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,780
can have Technologies which are good and

857
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,220
can be implemented all the technical

858
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,079
jargons whichever you want to throw are

859
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,099
good

860
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,260
I think there are two things to look at

861
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,480
it one is a prediction and see what can

862
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,579
be secured but second is also in case

863
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,800
something goes wrong how can I how can I

864
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,020
stand up faster and what is my learning

865
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,460
so that I can plug it in immediately

866
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,680
with an entire place now

867
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,540
I think lock 4G was a very good example

868
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,060
where people did not have a list of

869
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,220
things where all this would be used and

870
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,780
how to do it maybe that is one of the

871
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,000
areas which will become even bigger if

872
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,520
you have connected networks so just food

873
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,940
for thought

874
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,619
yeah I think uh

875
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,920
awareness skill signals and uh I think

876
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,440
in a lot of cases that we discussed and

877
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,000
some of the attack vectors that we also

878
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
looked at they got introduced because of

879
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,180
certain ignorances or certain uh you

880
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,920
know shortcuts that people took but I

881
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,200
think conferences like these where we

882
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
specifically debate about security and

883
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,720
look at it from different ways uh I

884
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,180
think help makes product developers more

885
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,980
aware about the security implications

886
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,960
and I do really hope that as more people

887
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,500
start looking into it as an industry uh

888
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,099
we commoditize the cost of building this

889
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,560
uh you know inbuilt Security in all

890
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,680
these devices uh much more much more

891
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,230
easier for everyone to do in adopt

892
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,180
[Music]

893
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,839
right uh well from my side uh I stay

894
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,880
positive

895
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,339
and uh I mean

896
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,020
fully driven to make Healthcare better

897
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,619
okay and uh obviously I strongly believe

898
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,720
uh server and clients are made for each

899
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,880
other and it says that we need to

900
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,800
connect them securely

901
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,920
and again like uh the only thing which I

902
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,320
always believe I mean uh one should

903
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,960
really connect with their device first

904
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,900
well before somebody else connects them

905
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,060
outside so

906
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,520
let's start it I think one one more

907
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,980
point which I would say uh test of times

908
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,500
right so with all security we all scared

909
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,720
people we all gave uh various kind of

910
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,940
solutions at some point in time

911
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,740
probably last two three years have been

912
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,839
testing time for most of us especially

913
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,540
from security side when people were

914
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,140
working from non-odcs at at an insecure

915
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,240
place of their own home probably people

916
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,040
in one room three different people from

917
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,599
three different companies who can be

918
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,180
competitors working together but we we

919
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,800
did not see that kind of a breach

920
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,800
everywhere human value went up uh

921
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,079
support was good I.T security succeeded

922
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,300
to a larger extent I mean I'm not saying

923
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,579
we we did the best but we it didn't go

924
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,920
down the drains just like that so we

925
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,960
still have hopes we're all together in

926
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,780
it yeah great

927
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,140
all right questions from the audience

928
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,780
yeah please fire them we have two chip

929
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,220
manufacturers we have Healthcare

930
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,220
manufacturers we have industrial uh

931
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,220
manufacturer and and and and and energy

932
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,920
as well

933
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,560
hi everyone this is Anil from carrier

934
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,040
I just have a one question which is

935
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,960
about the product which we are selling

936
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,260
in U.S okay on the e-commerce website

937
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,280
it's hardly is 25 to 30 dollars if I and

938
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,020
we are making sure that we follow the

939
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,140
basic security requirement now if I add

940
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,839
more security into it the product will

941
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,140
cost around 200 so should I add security

942
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,180
into it or should I not add security

943
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,740
into it

944
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,560
can I take that I think it's an

945
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,599
interesting question uh the way I look

946
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,700
at it is security is also demand based

947
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,980
so if you're 25 work

948
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,859
addresses the thing what is there and

949
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,540
it's not connecting Beyond a point to

950
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,760
which is uh you know which is going to

951
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,820
be worse than that then it's okay but if

952
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,320
I am looking to buy something which is

953
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,420
going to secure my house and this data

954
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,980
this this device can actually connect

955
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,140
and be the loophole I would be okay to

956
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,900
spend 100 on top of it so I think it's

957
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,460
also about the applicability it's not

958
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,920
about just the price so the best I mean

959
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,300
more money does not give you better

960
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,220
quality more money just makes you feel

961
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,500
egoistic that I can buy better that's

962
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,180
that's my feed on it it's it's neat base

963
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,680
uh thank you for the informative panel

964
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,560
my name is Prashant so uh I guess my

965
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,200
question was for uh those of you who

966
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,060
work with industrial Control Systems as

967
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,060
well as medical devices uh quite a few

968
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,680
of these devices like implants or even

969
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,660
devices in the field in Industry Control

970
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,820
Systems there are oil pipelines and

971
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,339
stuff uh they are meant to last for

972
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,619
several decades right like I just moved

973
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,900
into a building that's provided

974
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,000
automation by Johnson Controls and one

975
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
thing that really scares me is that the

976
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,440
building is meant to last for like at

977
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,180
least 50 years before they tear it down

978
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,020
so uh and you just talked about

979
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,880
encryption like uh the devices that we

980
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,220
are deploying today are so resource

981
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,599
constrained that you can't even support

982
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,300
state of the art encryption so the

983
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,400
circumstance does seem very dire like

984
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,440
what really is the Hope for devices that

985
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,440
are meant to last 50 years then so

986
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,280
I think

987
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,839
on it yeah do you want to answer this

988
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,520
question or should I call security and

989
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,420
ask him to go out

990
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,239
[Music]

991
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,540
so uh

992
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,460
this is where even companies like us we

993
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,700
are also learning uh if we look at uh

994
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,619
how these devices are uh structured they

995
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:25,020
are meant to last for that long but as

996
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,200
an industry one of the key issues is

997
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,380
we are not able to keep uh Pace with the

998
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,400
changes in the pki side so uh is it

999
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,560
I mean am I going to assure you that

1000
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,660
tomorrow everything will be hunky-dory

1001
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,660
no there is a that's the reason why we

1002
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,880
are over here to understand to look at

1003
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,980
what the industry is doing and slowly

1004
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,780
try to scale up it's not it's not going

1005
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,119
to happen overnight but probably the

1006
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,060
next generation of products of say

1007
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,339
either from the medical side or uh

1008
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,500
building automation side they will end

1009
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,300
up getting more and more secure it's

1010
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,119
akin to what uh Asim was saying the I.T

1011
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,599
world where it was 15 20 years back that

1012
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,839
is where we are and we also need our uh

1013
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,520
what you can say the Microsoft moment

1014
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,839
where uh Bill Gates decided uh at after

1015
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,839
the 4.1 Fiasco so that's where we are

1016
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,839
and uh as an industry we all have to

1017
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,359
strive to bring all this up as they say

1018
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,160
the rising tide brings all the boats up

1019
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,260
so that's the best answer I can give you

1020
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,480
at this point in time

1021
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,480
foreign

1022
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,859
if you are a consumer you should be

1023
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,960
willing to you should expect to pay more

1024
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,280
right I mean every time you

1025
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,220
that let's let's take Alexa right I mean

1026
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,740
that's a it has a most of the Alexa

1027
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,480
devices have a far field microphone

1028
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,000
which is backed by a security chip I

1029
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,740
mean so but you pay a certain amount of

1030
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,260
money 30 40 dollars to 100 depending on

1031
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,940
the device so that can support that cost

1032
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,880
structure you can also buy these kind of

1033
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,200
speakers from

1034
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,560
very very cheap sources right and

1035
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,359
obviously there is some Corner that's

1036
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,460
going to be cut so as a consumer you

1037
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,680
should expect to pay more as a corporate

1038
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,900
again it I think it boils down to

1039
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,420
specifications

1040
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,079
I think one uh pleasing thing to uh note

1041
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,260
here is that uh at least for us we keep

1042
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,240
hearing questions from customers where

1043
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,819
they're looking at crypto agility uh

1044
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,800
which talks about how effectively can

1045
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,619
software on your chips catch up if there

1046
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:40,619
are enhancements or upgrades to crypto

1047
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,540
protocols so that even if the product is

1048
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,520
deployed in the field it can be

1049
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,339
subsequently upgraded to use uh higher

1050
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,680
versions of the protocol so that's uh

1051
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,400
definitely a great uh Trend uh the other

1052
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,280
threshold really is also the pqc post

1053
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,480
Quantum uh cryptography and that is

1054
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,819
which goes back to your question also

1055
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,280
because how things change before and

1056
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,800
after that is something uh worth looking

1057
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,040
at

1058
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,800
yes and one of the things I wonder is

1059
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,920
yeah all right last question will that

1060
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,020
that will be the last question after me

1061
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,020
and now we'll put trouble more on there

1062
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,300
so the gentleman and on the on the on

1063
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,700
stage like uh I taken actually notes it

1064
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,319
is very interesting we actually skipped

1065
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:33,060
the most interesting part of the segment

1066
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,920
which is that who are all the threat

1067
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,920
actors so if you see uh you can you hear

1068
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,119
us yeah so the if you start uh the way

1069
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,460
how the whole Evolution process we

1070
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,280
noticed lot of great innovators are the

1071
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,500
movie directors The Fast and Furious

1072
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,480
movie are shown in another movie they

1073
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,339
show a submarine has been remotely

1074
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,140
controlled at that time when I was

1075
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,560
watching I was thinking yeah

1076
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,300
now people are talking about uavs that

1077
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,520
is underwater drones are evolved and

1078
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,099
that is remotely controlled a drone is

1079
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,380
nothing but a small submarine I can go

1080
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,839
and then take a hit because if I could

1081
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,760
compromise and then penetrate it into

1082
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,079
that system the remote control system

1083
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,440
and is it only in defense where like no

1084
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,540
if you say in 2018 if I'm not wrong

1085
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,339
there's a think tank which is called

1086
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,980
Basics uh they did a research on the

1087
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,720
Trident missiles which are put into a

1088
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,900
submarine uh was remotely controlled by

1089
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,700
hackers I don't want to name the country

1090
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,859
so they could compromise and then they

1091
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:34,980
were initiated the sequence but you need

1092
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,780
to put a physical key to fire that was

1093
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,099
the only control which saved the Trident

1094
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,380
missiles not to be fired from the

1095
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,020
submarine right so it was so complicated

1096
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,300
but now it is easy but what was the

1097
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,680
malware that time that malware was

1098
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,060
nothing but actually Wanna Cry

1099
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,940
compromised so from there now are we

1100
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,220
only looking at defense no no now if you

1101
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,800
see the CCTV is I can't get into aseem's

1102
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,240
house and then see what's happening but

1103
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,160
does he have a CCTV that is connected to

1104
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,960
the CCTV Network I just need to sit

1105
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,819
outside and then compromise so threat

1106
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,319
actor could be anybody it's not only

1107
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,260
defense uh the panel is let's say NXT

1108
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,420
system so who was telling I want to know

1109
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,300
what is a Nexus 610 next planning so so

1110
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,160
you have I can see that he is wearing a

1111
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,040
red maybe Apple watch so if I know how

1112
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,500
to get into I I can hear him I know

1113
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,359
which room to room he is going to shift

1114
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,760
so this is this has opened up

1115
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,300
interesting concept of hacking one of

1116
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,060
young kid today afternoon he met me he

1117
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,260
was talking uh it's like

1118
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,720
in your company says like how do you

1119
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,339
know I overheard you now people don't

1120
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:39,900
need to overheard you all they need to

1121
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,460
do is they need to get into the system

1122
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,280
where we all are connected to Smart we

1123
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,800
are losing smartness so being said all

1124
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,200
this thing my question is there's so

1125
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,540
many things are we looking at it I'm a

1126
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,480
baby I'm asking you are be doing like we

1127
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,520
are looking at I.T sock do we have iot

1128
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,240
stock Have You iot sock like OT sock do

1129
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,420
we have OT sock uh if we have OT sock

1130
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,420
have we actually identified the iocs do

1131
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,700
we have thread monitoring where threat

1132
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,980
hunting are we doing and are we rolling

1133
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,660
up sleeves putting everybody together

1134
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,180
and then say okay we have identified

1135
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,520
these many threads like fire2 is doing

1136
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,380
great job so have we put it all together

1137
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,060
sharing it between the organizations

1138
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,319
because I believe there is an

1139
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,480
organization called nciapc which is

1140
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,000
phone so is it being shared are we

1141
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,920
insert panel was there they were talking

1142
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,619
about itit are we doing anything on iot

1143
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,000
because you guys are actually really

1144
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,420
scared us so without solution so let me

1145
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,040
try and tell you you had all the answers

1146
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,359
you act I don't know if you asked a

1147
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:43,319
question or gave the answer as well but

1148
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,619
but the thing is uh there is there are a

1149
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,440
lot of organizations who have OT and it

1150
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,960
uh monitoring centers and they are

1151
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,420
converging together and now what you see

1152
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,339
is not only a sock expert but an OT

1153
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,800
expert also sits in that monitoring room

1154
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,560
and then they control it this line will

1155
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,480
merge at some point in time and that is

1156
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,640
where the industry is moving is there a

1157
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,560
Consortium of an industry which actually

1158
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,319
talks about it there are a lot many

1159
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:11,400
depending on the verticals of the

1160
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,920
Industries or cross Industries and these

1161
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,900
are also very good con you know areas

1162
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,579
where these kind of conversations happen

1163
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,960
but yes is everything private some my

1164
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,700
take I know we are recording but my take

1165
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,500
is privacy is a myth

1166
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,599
and that's that's a reality you were

1167
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,099
talking about the watch you know that

1168
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,180
Garmin was once uh actually accidentally

1169
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,260
shared the location of all the military

1170
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,240
U.S military folks because they were

1171
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,760
doing a drill somewhere

1172
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,220
throughout I'm sorry sorry my bad so

1173
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,740
yeah so the these These are reality but

1174
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,900
yes the as as on inside right we are

1175
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,359
learning also so it is a cat and mouse

1176
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,160
Chase someday we will be better someday

1177
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,839
they will be better but this this is

1178
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,880
going to evolve

1179
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,180
yeah and your your question your answer

1180
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,220
both are to the point but there is a lot

1181
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,079
more Nuance to it so companies are doing

1182
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,720
that many of us are doing it but it's

1183
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,000
not just that for example

1184
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,220
iots are proliferating so they will soon

1185
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,560
be 3x4x the number of your regular

1186
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,520
assets

1187
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,980
you may your sock May notice something

1188
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,260
your iot sock but who the hell owns it

1189
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,079
where the hell is it located right just

1190
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,420
knowing an IP address is not enough so

1191
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,040
you have to look at

1192
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,240
in importing all your iot data into your

1193
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,079
cmdb probably keep your owner's data

1194
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,180
updated location that are updated it's

1195
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,640
it's a hell lot of work and after that

1196
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,280
even if you detect all of it if it's an

1197
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,160
unupdatable you know again one of those

1198
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,819
five dollar things right I mean you have

1199
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:46,500
to still at the end of the day you have

1200
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,000
to physically send somebody to yank it

1201
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,260
off the network right I mean so it it

1202
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,839
it's complicated I think that's the

1203
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,140
summary

1204
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,680
all right

1205
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,319
time of year already uh 10 minutes past

1206
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:04,680
with 3 40 and I think people want to go

1207
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,559
for break so we'll we'll close here you

1208
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,260
can come and ask the question after we

1209
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,680
close all right so uh some points from

1210
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,920
today's panel discussion we need uh uh

1211
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,380
good skill set specifically around iot

1212
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,960
and embedded uh we need to have some

1213
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,000
kind of a collaboration with third-party

1214
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,839
vendors on standards uh we need to look

1215
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,700
at responsibility chain

1216
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,040
for uh you know when there are attacks

1217
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,040
or incidents uh we need to build trust

1218
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,540
from grounds up and we need basic uh

1219
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,800
crypto

1220
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,920
all right with that thank you so much

1221
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,859
