1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,339
thank you so much nalcon it's great to

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,820
be back right uh thanks hello panelists

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,480
today's topic is disruptive Technologies

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,460
and its impact on csos careers

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,440
provocative is the Seesaw dead if he

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,060
doesn't catch on to the Technologies we

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,439
have the world's best speakers out here

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,300
let's challenge them let's have a good

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,660
session audience do your best we'll try

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,279
and answer those questions Jackson

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,660
opening comments to you the opening

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,480
batsman what type of Technologies are

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,860
disruptive so cloud is one of our

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,899
disruptive it's here what is the

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,300
District of Technology what should csos

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,760
do your opening comments on this great

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,860
topic

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,840
um hello hi uh good afternoon everybody

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,140
and thank you Burgess and uh actually

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,379
thank you to nalcon and antriksh we are

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,079
back after two years so it's wonderful

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,199
to see faces back again at nullcon

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,600
um from my side you know some of the

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,059
technologies that are for me are

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,580
disruptive even ahead is the application

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,040
let's say for example for blockchain we

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,720
still are talking about blockchain and

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
it's become synonymous with

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,439
cryptocurrency but I think the

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
applications go beyond that and I think

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,220
we have a lot to secure on that and I'm

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,740
not talking only from a perspective of

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,460
an airport or of a private Enterprise I

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,900
think the applications of blockchain

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,900
will go out into voting tomorrow for

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,880
example I mean we know that Pharma is

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,060
built for blockchain but voting if

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,799
you're doing if you're buying property

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,900
so it impacts all each and every one of

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,479
us these are applications of blockchain

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,939
which is yet to materialize so I think

42
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,500
these are and plus robotics unmanned

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,240
aerial Vehicles unmanned ground Vehicles

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,280
now this is more from an airport

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,439
application so I think these are few of

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,060
the disruptive areas that are coming up

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,579
I think which we need to tackle thanks

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,520
Jackson and good over to you from a from

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,100
uh conglorum age to an airport to you to

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,619
phone pay okay

51
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,780
Jackson mentioned about blockchain

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,880
applications and unmanned aerial

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,340
vehicles from your perspective

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,620
what type of Technologies are in the

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,000
future which the generation out here

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,860
should be aware of you should be aware

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,379
of and you should be mastering sure I

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,720
think uh let's check yeah okay so

59
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
according to me I think I've been part

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,040
of the startups in India I'll try and

61
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
focus more of Indian uh Indian culture

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
so I think in India destruction started

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,060
with when jio started the price fall

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,280
rights we had we came up with internet

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,620
with everyone and that's where our

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,360
disruption started in terms of Indian

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
I.T Tech so when I mentioned that

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,260
internet uh everything around internet

69
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,940
started changing for India right it

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,459
might be e-commerce have picked up then

71
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,739
we came up with UPI right and then we

72
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,660
came up with the ondc props the latest

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,000
ones coming up so I think specifically

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
talking about India these are the future

75
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,239
disruptions which people should know

76
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,280
specifically in India yeah

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
okay so but which particular technology

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,459
you're talking of do you talking of

79
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,160
Telecom or 5G or which one do you think

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,920
is more disruptive in nature so I think

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,680
in terms of technology I think uh again

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,440
5G will will disrupt a lot for sure uh

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
when it comes to speed we using 5G will

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
have more devices connected uh we'll

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,080
have more bandwidth and it will affect

86
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,879
nearly every domain it might be internet

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,340
e-commerce or Healthcare so I think it

88
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,900
will disrupt according to me 5G and

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,760
others will be the most destructive

90
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,340
Sandeep over to you uh from

91
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,140
airports to what he mentioned to a tech

92
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,879
company in the world

93
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,099
where are you preparing to be disruptive

94
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,659
in nature and how are you securing that

95
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,659
Journey yeah so we are in Engineering

96
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,080
Services Company so what we see as

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
destructive Technologies are your

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,420
autonomous vehicles okay digital twins

99
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,480
we are also talking about digital twin

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,480
for the Earth right so that is uh coming

101
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,980
up and then we have this bio hike for

102
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,340
hacking I like that okay bio hacking bio

103
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,200
hacking that's a topic for next time

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,319
I'll go on session training session

105
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,080
yeah so biohacking is there so these are

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,978
some areas right and yeah your EVS okay

107
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,000
so big time

108
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,460
say autonomous vehicles which are coming

109
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,240
up right so these are some areas in the

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,699
engineering side where we see there's a

111
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,380
lot of disruptions

112
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,960
come on Save the best of the last these

113
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
guys are covered from autonomous

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
vehicles to 5G to unmann Aerial to

115
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,380
blockchain to biohacking to digital twin

116
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,960
for the Earth whatever that means uh

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,940
sure what's your choice and then the

118
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,000
audience gets sure so I think if I talk

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,280
about the disruptive Technologies to me

120
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,979
uh I I would say I think Jackson already

121
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,780
covered I think blockchain is definitely

122
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,699
a you know disruptive technology and

123
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,620
it's gonna pick up a lot there was

124
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,240
another session also going on in the

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,639
morning we heard the complexities of

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,979
that you know same like you know uh

127
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,100
multi-chain cross chain uh so I think

128
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,900
that's a blockchain is definitely the

129
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,759
one and if I talk about from my own

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,220
experience uh in our organization I

131
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,919
think we are going to make use of arvr

132
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,720
by you know going to implement the

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,960
metaverse so for our organization uh we

134
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,360
plan to use it for collaboration for our

135
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,000
client visits so that's one another area

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,580
that we have and then I think we have

137
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,979
already kind of come to an age where we

138
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,440
are moving towards the web 3.0 which is

139
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,759
you know supposed to be full of

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,520
distributed computing uh I would say

141
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
which is quantum again disruptive and

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,979
further off do you consider that uh yeah

143
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,560
but to be honest not much exposure to

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,300
that that how soon it's gonna come and

145
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,000
that's where the topic okay great but

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,740
yeah I think that these are the areas

147
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,240
which I think you know are quite

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,580
disruptive and gonna change the way we

149
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,560
are gonna do the business thanks so

150
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,840
question for the audience right we have

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,220
the esteem panelists talking about

152
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,419
blockchain 5G uh digital twin for the

153
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,240
Earth autonomous vehicles uh Engineering

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Services

155
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,000
are these guys really covering it or is

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080
there something much more which you

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
would like yes sir to Mike's here please

158
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,880
we need more people with mics

159
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,639
and ask the toughest questions yeah so

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,560
the toughest I think will be one behind

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,120
my crease will be the quantum

162
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,979
Technologies implementation probably the

163
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,160
qkd and the post Quantum cryptography

164
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,620
and as you are speaking about a digital

165
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,699
twin

166
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,660
uh possible solution or will be in a

167
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,419
metaverse availability of people 24 7.

168
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,460
today I'll go and go back and sleep in

169
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,560
the night but if my if I'm in a meta

170
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
verse I have to be available 24 7. so

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,580
you're talking off two disruptive

172
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,460
Technologies merging together blockchain

173
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,139
metaverse which is in your link but with

174
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,160
Quantum mic there gentlemen yeah thank

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,340
you

176
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,560
yeah so I also had a similar point of

177
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,300
quantum technology because it is soon

178
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,259
going to change the entire

179
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,880
telecommunication infrastructure that we

180
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,860
have a lot of investment has also

181
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,360
already gone in the foreign countries

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,160
like they have a tactical Network laid

183
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,780
out and they are working on the

184
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,960
satellite communication mostly in China

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,460
and we at India are also struggling to

186
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,319
implement it so what is your take on

187
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,960
that is it more of a buzz or it is

188
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,940
something which which is a much required

189
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,860
thing

190
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,680
but just to answer all right

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,819
thanks

192
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,440
at this stage I think we are exploring

193
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
it I think uh there are a few startups

194
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,220
who are doing that they worked with the

195
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,240
army

196
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,560
should you write the word struggling is

197
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,759
something we all are getting a hands on

198
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,259
that I'm sure some countries have got it

199
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,660
better but 5G itself is coming inside so

200
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,699
the applications of next technology in

201
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,780
India is still going to be a bit more

202
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,419
behind on that uh Mike there please I

203
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:49,860
think

204
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,780
the question in Hindi I like the way you

205
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,819
normally ask yes

206
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,340
Okay so

207
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,340
foreign

208
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,529
[Music]

209
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:17,060
[Laughter]

210
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,080
foreign

211
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,279
[Music]

212
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,660
I will mess up that's why I'm speaking

213
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,860
back in English

214
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,399
I know Hindi uh having said that this is

215
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
for the same reason I don't worry about

216
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,940
getting stabbed in the night every day

217
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,560
when I'm driving back home because I

218
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,800
have not experienced it so why and a

219
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,899
society doesn't talk about a problem is

220
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,519
because we don't face it enough it's

221
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,860
it's very simple if it becomes a problem

222
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,140
we will all tackle it together having

223
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,880
said that what are the problems that we

224
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
are tackling today we have enough on our

225
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,980
hands ransomware it's it's there how it

226
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,440
gets in that's there so that is what we

227
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,620
are tackling about yes the future does

228
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,380
make sense and here comes the aspect of

229
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,019
application of that so for example when

230
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,240
I say you know I took the example of

231
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,160
blockchain

232
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,920
um just to see a candid question to

233
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,720
everybody here is the blockchain

234
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,880
unhackable

235
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,399
can it be hacked

236
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,580
yes so the thing is that until yesterday

237
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,740
the whole Mantra was that it's

238
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,720
unhackable everybody should move to that

239
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,120
the point is that we don't know what are

240
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,560
the implications of it and the

241
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,540
applications of it that's why why are we

242
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,220
not talking about one particular problem

243
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,839
Maybe

244
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,540
enough people haven't faced the problem

245
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,459
but it's a problem I'm not disputing

246
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,560
that so agree with Jackson in the

247
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,180
morning we are having breakfast and he

248
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,240
had a good point his philosophy and I

249
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
like if you can challenge that is I will

250
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,220
cater to a problem once it becomes a

251
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,019
problem today seasons have business and

252
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,120
10 other problems does the audience have

253
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,740
a perspective on that that should I see

254
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,940
so

255
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,640
look at a distant take once it becomes

256
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
imminent enough or should it be

257
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,660
forthcoming yeah sir one last question

258
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,399
Just moment please yeah yeah please

259
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:44,700
[Laughter]

260
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
foreign

261
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:15,670
[Laughter]

262
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,540
that's that's a serious question you you

263
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,959
asked the right question even and for I

264
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,260
think for the last decade cloudification

265
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,660
uh take everything to the cloud and now

266
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,100
everybody's bringing some things back

267
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,240
from the cloud

268
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,680
for the very same reason we're doing

269
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,380
four more

270
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,579
manufacturing industry also if you have

271
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,880
C you know say automations are existing

272
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,839
right so uh be it a uh automated vehicle

273
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,180
routing or or whatever it is so

274
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,040
automations were available in

275
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,920
manufacturing industry from uh very long

276
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,079
time okay but now we are talking about

277
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,540
robotic process automations and all that

278
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,220
because these Technologies are catching

279
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,779
up because they are supporting

280
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,640
environments which are available so same

281
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,500
with blockchain also so it has been

282
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,720
bundled and now it is catching up more

283
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,700
good thanks Sandeep uh you want to

284
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,279
mention something uncooked no I think uh

285
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,079
here rightly said by jaxi I think it's

286
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,060
more about fomo what people in Industry

287
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,260
think about it and that's where

288
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,880
investors will also go that's where more

289
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,740
money will be poured in and that's where

290
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,420
the whole whole work will go into so I

291
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,860
think rightly pointed out we have

292
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,959
problems we have different solutions but

293
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,700
it's more about what industry has to use

294
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,860
so is it formal what is your view Smith

295
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,500
it's it's more like fomo if you ask me

296
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,540
because it's like competition if the

297
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,220
other guy is doing it let me go and try

298
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,440
to do it I one important questions by

299
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
the way which is really which is

300
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
basically for the csos okay now one

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,380
interesting thing that has happened is

302
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,360
that Cobalt Strike Source Code has been

303
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
leaked and now there have been various

304
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,420
various players who are basically coming

305
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,339
in and creating their own command and

306
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,200
controls and there is a new buzzword

307
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,120
which is not letting us sleep in fact

308
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,160
the csos as well that is human operated

309
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,959
ransomware targeting through active

310
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,100
directory

311
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,019
now how are we going to deal with those

312
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,639
situations and what should we are

313
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,139
approach on tackling human operated

314
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,040
ransomware and specially uh being the

315
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,480
non-commercialization of cobalt strike

316
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,760
which used to cost like 75 000 to

317
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,100
getting it open source uh command and

318
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,779
controls which are being plugged plugged

319
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,160
and play kind of thing that is happening

320
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,320
I'll answer a question and then I'll

321
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,240
give it to my fellow sqc Source I think

322
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,980
the short answer is hire the best talent

323
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,680
from welcome

324
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,600
and let them do that right but I'll

325
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,980
leave it to you Kumar you want to

326
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,660
mention that sorry your question was or

327
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,019
you can say hi everybody

328
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,940
that's a smart option sorry just don't

329
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,380
be clear with the question your question

330
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,600
was that if the source code got leaked

331
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,360
and then you know it is being used so

332
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,980
what exactly is the question mobile

333
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,360
strike is basically a command and

334
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,100
control that's right you can say yeah

335
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,260
that's right and that source code of

336
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,240
cobal strike is leak now there are uh

337
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,860
different command and controls that have

338
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,339
been built in

339
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
cheaper versions coming out if there are

340
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,540
better versions coming out correct maybe

341
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,100
they can use more of that so is that up

342
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,660
is that a problem at same time hackers

343
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,980
are using it for weaponizing and

344
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,779
constantly targeting it yeah so that

345
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,160
keeps happening I mean to say nothing

346
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,459
new with that we heard you know someone

347
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,100
tool in fact the mannion got hacked a

348
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,720
lot of you know their tools were you

349
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,279
know allegedly supposed to be or they

350
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,139
were called out you know kind of fact so

351
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,420
it doesn't depends it doesn't matter

352
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,519
actually you know if if it's an

353
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,320
established tool that got hacked or

354
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,880
there will be new tools to keep coming

355
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,920
up let me put it this way earlier time

356
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
what we used to do we used to change the

357
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,820
RDP number or we used

358
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,079
we used to change the RDP number from

359
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,459
3389 to something else or basically

360
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,079
used to happen now what is happening is

361
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
there is an attacker who's coming in

362
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,899
who's doing turbo roasting who's doing

363
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,459
golden ticket attack trying to

364
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:21,839
compromise domain controller and

365
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,459
spreading into the network just because

366
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,320
of these human operations it's not new

367
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,339
Smith

368
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,300
excuse me good to see you though

369
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,500
I think that's got access to a lot of

370
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,560
people no but it's not new I mean human

371
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,600
operated ransomware

372
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,339
in fact couple strike coming out in fact

373
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,000
if I'm not mistaken there was uh

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,560
variation to that which is available now

375
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,720
to Cobalt strike which I believe in

376
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,339
Indian has actually written that

377
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,720
question

378
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,820
if I'm not mistaken so they will always

379
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,160
find different ones I mean I don't

380
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,740
necessarily see it as that difference so

381
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,600
his point is Cesar sees multiple threads

382
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,519
multiple tools you only has to combat

383
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,139
first line of difference

384
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,560
I have a question so

385
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,660
I'll just give an example uh so let's

386
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,699
say uh crypto or blockchain you written

387
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,899
the question on the phone reading it

388
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,940
so prepared yeah blockchain right uh so

389
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,380
few years back people said okay I don't

390
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,639
believe in crypto I don't believe in

391
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,320
blockchain you don't believe uh people

392
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,519
used to say there are people they say

393
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,260
okay I don't believe in Bitcoin but you

394
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,800
see uh now in the crypto winter a lot of

395
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,260
people who are they are losing job but

396
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,760
uh even if they believe or not believe

397
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,160
their life expecting impact so in the

398
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,019
same way uh I believe it will grow a lot

399
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,560
so my question is how Hands-On scissors

400
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,820
should be in this disorder technology

401
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,440
because these are new technologies and

402
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,820
they are creating impact on people's

403
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,440
lives very fast that's a planted

404
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,420
question Kumar you want to answer

405
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,120
yeah so again I think maybe I'm not able

406
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,339
to hear it but this question is and the

407
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,259
whole topic discussion how technical

408
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,600
should csos be you know he said two

409
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,459
years back they said crypto won't affect

410
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,959
us blockchain won't affect us but now

411
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,839
it's here how technical should csos be

412
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,220
and how should they become technical

413
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,439
besides hiring the best talent get it

414
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,119
how should they themselves improvise it

415
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,760
to to get ahead of the curve and advice

416
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,559
and secure the companies sure thanks for

417
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,720
translating so uh that's a question what

418
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,280
I would say is that you know a person

419
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,500
cannot be technical uh in all the

420
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,880
technology especially when the

421
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,679
Technologies are changing when the world

422
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,660
is transforming at the speed of you know

423
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,900
the BAU so it's always good to have as

424
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,459
much technical knowledge that you have

425
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,280
but at some point in time you know for

426
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,320
you to be a c so it doesn't only need to

427
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
be you know the Hands-On and the very

428
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,580
much technical part of it unless you are

429
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,380
into a you know service provider

430
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,179
business where it is all the more

431
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,460
relevant but the idea is to understand

432
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,520
how the security threat landscape is

433
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,799
changing what are the new disruption and

434
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,140
Transformations are you know happening

435
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,880
so what happens when a technology

436
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,520
changes the transformation happens it is

437
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,200
just that the Battleground is changing

438
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
right the fundamentals of security would

439
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,160
remain same you know you have to ensure

440
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
the CI is still you still have to ensure

441
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,200
the right authentication authorization

442
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,179
so just that its manifestation changes

443
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,039
when the new technologies come in right

444
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,799
blockchain it has got its own set of you

445
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,419
know unique uh I would say

446
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,700
vulnerabilities but the existing ones

447
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,440
they do very well still apply to those

448
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,200
so the idea is to have the right set of

449
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
people to have a right sense of where

450
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,100
the industry is moving and you know

451
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,080
sticking it to the goal prioritizing

452
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,360
your you know areas of your focus and

453
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,919
that's how it should be a strategy so

454
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,799
CSO is I would not say a pure play a

455
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,440
technical role you have people to do the

456
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,059
technical jobs and you should let them

457
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,039
to do you know those kind of things you

458
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,539
should be more you know strategic and

459
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,460
holistic and looking at you know to the

460
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,740
ID and you know operate governance

461
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,840
thanks so I don't know if many of you

462
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,700
know Rahul but India's most prominent

463
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,820
leader in its security leadership

464
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,980
everything now today's topic discussion

465
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,880
is

466
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
and you will write about it I'm sure

467
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,960
digital Technologies and csos careers

468
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,700
you know if they probably don't catch up

469
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,200
it could affect the career or somebody

470
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,000
could take that you've taken a long time

471
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,100
to come to that seat on the table what's

472
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,080
your perspective if you write about it

473
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
how does a CSO get so adapt at new

474
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,760
technological changes so fast blockchain

475
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,820
AI crypto we had digital twin for Earth

476
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,059
biohacking autonomous vehicles aibi 5G

477
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,039
unmanned Vehicles how should the CSO be

478
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,840
able to adapt to all this technically

479
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
okay so uh

480
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,580
I mean my answer to that is that let's

481
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,000
not read Cesar as a god let's ask God I

482
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,220
thought they were God let Caesars be

483
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,220
humans and uh you know

484
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,620
as a human you have

485
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,559
your limitations you have your I mean

486
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,220
urge to learn as well however uh the

487
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,280
kind of uh environment that I am seeing

488
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
and witnessing these days there's a lot

489
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,440
of stress being put and a lot of onus

490
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,600
being put on a seesaw that you know ciso

491
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,179
will solve every damn problem which

492
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,039
exists in an organization as far as

493
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,600
cyber security is concerned

494
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,039
so uh you know on one on on one hand we

495
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,020
we say that CSO has to have the business

496
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,539
Acumen business knowledge communication

497
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,260
skills on the other hand we uh say that

498
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,140
he has he or she has to have the

499
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,780
technical uh skills and knowledge on

500
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,679
Technologies so I mean there has to be a

501
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,360
blend of both for sure but uh there

502
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
there are limitations that that one has

503
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,980
to live with and to me the approach for

504
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,720
a CSO should be that they should know

505
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,480
the application of technology to solve

506
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,580
the problem not what Jax is mentioned

507
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,340
not the not not the actual

508
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,919
technicalities of those Technologies

509
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,720
thanks to our lovely inputs I've got

510
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,960
Nandan who runs one of the biggest Sim

511
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,520
product tools outside your perspective

512
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,500
because you are selling stuff to csos

513
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
right uh how equipped users should talk

514
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,559
that language you have an AIML solution

515
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,440
give me your views and I think it is uh

516
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,960
it's just imperative for your existence

517
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,179
it's imperative for their existence I

518
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,820
believe so because you can't just uh you

519
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,500
know block yourself out and live in a

520
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,600
shell and secret is not happening

521
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
it is definitely happening and uh you

522
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,160
know being able to put that into

523
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,260
perspective because you are

524
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,840
you are charged with a specific job to

525
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,700
make sure that you are securing your

526
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,580
operations like you know uh When leaders

527
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,559
fail then it's a major catastrophe so

528
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,539
you are at that Helm you are the one who

529
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,340
is in charge of making sure that you are

530
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,980
cognitive abilities are also at the

531
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,000
Forefront to make sure that you're

532
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,340
always keeping you know operational

533
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,900
technology and making sure that your

534
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,340
organization making sure the

535
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,740
organization is always on top so you

536
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,880
know so you're saying it's imperative

537
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,900
there's no choice I whatever

538
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,340
[Laughter]

539
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,039
yeah one more Mike here please thank you

540
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,679
uh you can stand up and talk just a

541
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,360
smaller projection here I can kick every

542
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,980
year also yeah so the interjection is

543
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,919
that uh you know uh

544
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,039
being a CSO you may have you may have

545
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
now gotten understanding that how many

546
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,760
csos come from a technology and

547
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,919
Technical background I mean if there are

548
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,539
more csos coming from non-technical

549
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,480
background that means something I mean

550
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,520
that is very good bad no it's it's a

551
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
good thing I mean then then you have a

552
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
blend of both that you have an

553
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,820
understanding of applying technology on

554
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,340
business issues you don't really need to

555
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,860
have deep understanding of Technology

556
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,120
so that's the audience is saying give

557
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,320
them technical he's saying he won't sell

558
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,120
to them I think you're the lady and the

559
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,220
gentleman yeah

560
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,500
so and while the answer uh your

561
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,559
perspective on code so he won't sell to

562
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,140
you if you're not taken enough

563
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,200
no so I I don't really think uh csos

564
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,179
have to be Hands-On Hands-On is a very

565
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,159
wide word where you actually think about

566
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,140
you know I'm starting to code or I'm

567
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,700
finding security issues or something of

568
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,860
that sort no I don't think we have we

569
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,299
probably will have time to be Hands-On

570
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,620
but I think there are a lot of

571
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,840
disruptions happening we still have to

572
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,000
be very very aware of what disruptions

573
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,700
can do to our company and then it makes

574
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,799
sense for me for my company to adapt it

575
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,740
and I should adapt it with it right so

576
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,539
that's very important I not I don't need

577
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,940
to be Hands-On expert but then I have to

578
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,620
be technically sound to understand such

579
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,200
Technologies I should be able to talk to

580
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,240
a junior candidate in my team and

581
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,640
understand what he's trying to say so

582
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,260
yeah please go ahead he's saying he

583
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,539
doesn't have to be Hands-On do you agree

584
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,260
uh yes I agree for example if there's a

585
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,799
CIO okay do we say that CIO should be

586
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,760
coding

587
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,620
see I should be knowing the coding do we

588
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,179
say that no right because there are

589
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,940
hundreds of Technology see I can't quote

590
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,000
right so why are we limiting the CSO

591
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,760
role as the technology only right I

592
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,200
think cyber security is beyond

593
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,539
technology we talk about cyber security

594
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,520
to be of integral part of the business

595
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,380
which has to start from product design

596
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,419
to the process design and then the

597
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,159
technology Design Technology design is

598
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,260
only a means of getting the controls

599
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,840
right but it has to start from the basic

600
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,340
and

601
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,960
there is there are two different roles

602
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,700
one is the cyber security and second is

603
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,460
the technology risk if you know only the

604
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,260
technology then you're a technology risk

605
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,600
person and not a CSO so I think it has

606
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,820
to be and I I go with the panel saying

607
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,740
that you should be able to correlate the

608
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,200
dot you should be able to uh you know

609
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,720
connect the dots make a scenario and

610
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
also see what is the business impact

611
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,740
right so in the coding like earlier what

612
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,780
we used to talk 15 20 years back like it

613
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,340
should be a techno functional when you

614
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,140
have to grow even from cyber security

615
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,700
perspective it should be a techno

616
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,159
functional so that's that's my stake as

617
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,440
a season thank you gentleman ahead of

618
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,860
you want to speak yep

619
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,360
go ahead

620
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,640
can you get more mics please

621
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,200
[Music]

622
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,880
I'll let go the same sentiments that the

623
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,400
lady just said that the foundational uh

624
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,799
foundation for you

625
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,860
yes for you

626
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,539
so uh

627
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,280
the points we're sitting with his boss

628
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,179
be careful

629
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:12,980
good one

630
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,240
you have to speak good go ahead I'm

631
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,480
sorry otherwise he'll employ you

632
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,700
so the foundation of any security

633
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,280
program lies with the inherent

634
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,260
understanding of risk and that is what

635
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,360
we want a CSO to contribute on so

636
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,340
whether we have a you know disruptive

637
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,260
technology like digital twin for Earth

638
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,159
or uh you know crypto or you know or

639
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,020
Quantum or any other thing coming like

640
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,659
that so as long as the CSO is able to

641
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,179
contribute how does this impact the

642
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,980
business function then I think he's

643
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,480
doing his job you don't want to see so

644
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,880
probably I mean if he can code in Python

645
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,400
and uh it's a fair point we all agree

646
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,900
the balance is good the most important

647
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,020
point on this session is how we all

648
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,360
agree ciso has injection over to you how

649
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,340
should the CSO being ignorant is not

650
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,740
good that clearly the the audience's

651
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,900
voices don't be ignorant uh you have to

652
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,179
be there you can't completely be on that

653
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,580
because as she said changes happen fast

654
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,080
but how step by step at least be able to

655
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,179
talk one hour of a challenge of vendor

656
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,039
or be able to have a meaningful

657
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,380
discussion with someone what how does

658
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,159
one see so adapt to that and I'll just

659
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,279
uh slightly separate the two things see

660
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,400
one when I say that should I be worried

661
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,279
about this to the gentleman's question

662
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,440
thing is that if it doesn't impact my

663
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,600
business today now for example I'll give

664
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,000
you an example of what we're talking

665
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,860
about

666
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,600
either aerial unmanned Vehicles drones

667
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,360
for example or uh unmanned ground

668
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,260
Vehicles now the research and the

669
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,940
activities around this has been going on

670
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,580
for a decade in fact more right I mean

671
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,380
everybody's seen the progress that's

672
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,740
happening now should I go and understand

673
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,600
intimately how an unmanned vehicle works

674
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,580
and everything right now in my job

675
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,039
position maybe not but tomorrow if my

676
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,559
airport decides Hey listen you have a

677
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,240
controlled environment on the air side

678
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,000
though there are very specific speed

679
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,220
limits there are Lanes through which the

680
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,260
vehicles today which are manned which

681
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,419
people and you guys have all gone to uh

682
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,220
everybody has gone to an airport you've

683
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,679
seen on the air side how the how the

684
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,779
land Vehicles move right along a

685
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,640
particular line particular speed they

686
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,039
cannot exceed they cannot overtake very

687
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,159
defined set of rules amazing uh what do

688
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,919
you say a Sandbox to try out an unmanned

689
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,200
ground vehicle over there when it comes

690
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,720
to that then yes as a c so I have to be

691
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,940
intimately involved and understand how

692
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,140
this works

693
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,799
a decade ago why why would I be was

694
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,020
there an application over here for the

695
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,880
same very same reason I don't understand

696
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,100
to the gentleman's question how

697
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,140
everything in cryptocurrency works I

698
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,919
don't and and to your question uh I just

699
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,380
want to answer I will fail not I have

700
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,620
failed I will fail and that's process of

701
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,580
life so as I see so also I will fail so

702
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,039
my point is that at that point of time

703
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,260
yes how it applies what is the use case

704
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,299
for my role that I have to apply to it

705
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,340
and that is why I will look into it

706
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,080
thanks for answered Kumar

707
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,960
yeah so I think uh pretty much I think

708
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,940
even the response would be it is

709
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,500
actually a balanced role you have to

710
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,419
have multifaceted it's not only a

711
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,159
Hands-On technical that's just one part

712
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,679
of it uh a lot of other things that come

713
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,179
with a you know a leadership role

714
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,340
whether it's in security it or any other

715
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,640
field I think with the CSO rule uh a

716
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,279
sense of prioritization the risk-based

717
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,620
approach financial management people

718
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,020
management I think that's what is a

719
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,120
comprehensive you know a leadership role

720
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,460
it is whether it is like a certain

721
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,240
security or I.T or Finance or HR so but

722
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,400
the point is your eye should be on the

723
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,799
target where the you know vision of the

724
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,840
organization is where the threat

725
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,380
landscape is moving are you having a

726
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,320
right sense of not only today but how

727
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,840
the future is gonna be like devops

728
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,360
devsecops is a classical example you

729
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,020
know

730
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,260
as a CSO you have to make sure when the

731
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,059
development is happening at the speed of

732
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,279
like you know business then how do you

733
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,140
ensure that the security is happening

734
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,700
there now it's not a very technical

735
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
Hands-On on to everything but if you

736
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,320
know how it works how the business is

737
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,240
functioning you will be very well able

738
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,520
to integrate the security into the

739
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,559
fabric of the organization so that's all

740
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,279
done thanks yeah so I would also uh Echo

741
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,460
the word vaccine Kumar have told so it's

742
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,159
a more of a generalist kind of a role

743
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,159
okay so threat is uh one side of it

744
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,500
there is a part of compliance which

745
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,179
comes okay there is a part of risk

746
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,880
management which comes of it so saying

747
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,700
that uh you need to still understand the

748
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,620
technology like Jackson was saying at

749
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,620
least the areas which you are using in

750
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,720
your organization or you are likely to

751
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,940
use in the future you definitely need to

752
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,820
understand the technology and how it can

753
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,760
be applied or how it is applied okay so

754
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,059
uh that way I think to that extent yes

755
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,039
you should uh I'll ask Rahul a question

756
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,440
back uh Jackson mentioned clearly the

757
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,480
steps that when it comes to him you know

758
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,240
he'll get tuned to it but you as a

759
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,760
editor of a magazine and running and if

760
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,380
you had a story how do you believe

761
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,179
seesaw should be adapt at New Gen

762
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,980
Technologies what should be a learning

763
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,840
path for them besides reading your

764
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,100
magazine I'm just saying and I'll write

765
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,220
a note but uh if they have a charter a

766
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,140
learning curve would they go and hire

767
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,480
Five Guys so many Mentor Cycles have

768
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,340
changed right earlier we thought we were

769
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,380
mentoring young Generations today many

770
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,940
of these are mentoring us on New Tech

771
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,980
because if you're not having a mentor

772
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,220
who's a a young kid we aren't learning

773
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,320
so with the main team mental cycle being

774
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,539
done and the mentor being a young kid

775
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,700
and weeping the mentees for new tech how

776
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,580
do you see this well I'm sure I mean a

777
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,039
lot of it comes from uh

778
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,659
in today's age a lot of it comes from

779
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,179
the peer sharing you're learning

780
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,779
also comes from the Partnerships that

781
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:15,120
assiso forges uh multiple stakeholders

782
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,159
not from not only from within the

783
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,820
organization I mean from the technology

784
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,100
vendors technology providers Consulting

785
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,100
organizations I mean person like you can

786
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,919
be a great mentor uh to uh to a c so on

787
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,480
a on an incident response communication

788
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,240
plan for that matter you know and and

789
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,880
when it comes to the technology uh I

790
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,039
mean you you spoke about uh you know the

791
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,140
knowledge on how how should they grow

792
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,059
their knowledge on technology

793
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,340
so I think that's also a gradual process

794
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,620
as as Jackson said that if it is

795
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,679
mandatory for him to know that how an

796
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,679
unmanned vehicle uh travels on that path

797
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,320
in the airport then it is very essential

798
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,320
for him to know in in going in depth of

799
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,720
that otherwise a superficial knowledge

800
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,000
uh would be would be fine to me I'm not

801
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,520
sure uh like they were superficial Ajit

802
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,919
over to you you try and sell and I know

803
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,480
I know you're not prepared for this you

804
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,659
come in the front row it's too tempting

805
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,120
you try and sell the Next Generation

806
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,340
Innovation to csos what is your

807
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,720
perspective of them where do you think

808
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,919
how should we understand your

809
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,360
Technologies

810
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,980
how ready should they be in next gen

811
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,880
Tech

812
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,760
yeah so uh csos have been very deceptive

813
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,679
they appreciate

814
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,620
they try to analyze with whatever use

815
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,179
cases they have the challenges they have

816
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,159
if it maps to their requirements then

817
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,840
yeah then then they take it ahead but

818
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,700
they are very empathetic with uh new

819
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,779
Innovations

820
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,120
and very keen to learn about it

821
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,220
okay thanks question to the audience

822
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,539
yeah

823
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,880
question Mike yeah please I have one

824
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,700
question look after him yeah so let you

825
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,880
go to what Jackson said on we'll have to

826
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,279
take it uh when it comes to us or when

827
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,200
we are faced with the threat uh how do

828
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,779
you see the current uh the Indian

829
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,460
Privacy Law that's going to come into

830
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,640
existence probably and also the kind of

831
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,460
tightening of the government uh agencies

832
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,080
with the kind of awareness that they

833
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,940
have on the public forums or the public

834
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,799
platform so how do you see is that going

835
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,019
to be really disrupting the life of a

836
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,179
Cesar or is that something that you need

837
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,299
to be prepared for or I think they

838
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,679
pulled back the law

839
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,899
correct so it's something that's going

840
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,340
to be around the corner let's say forget

841
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,500
it for the next I mean when did they

842
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
start talking about the law I think it

843
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,120
was uh

844
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,000
whenever it comes do you think we most

845
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,159
tougher stringent I think it came so

846
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,200
close to the finish line that all the

847
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Caesars got uh pretty worried about it

848
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,840
and I I'm I can I don't know I I'm not

849
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,120
speaking for on behalf of my colleagues

850
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,460
and peers but I remember and being in

851
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,799
discussions telling all my vendors do

852
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,539
you have data center here or outside

853
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,120
bring everything here because I don't

854
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
know what the government is going to do

855
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,240
tomorrow so you bring everything here so

856
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,760
yes that was a concern and I think to a

857
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,899
great extent see uh naturally India as a

858
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,560
nation has uh economically boomed so

859
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,739
much that every major presence is

860
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,659
already here now so I think from a data

861
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,239
perspective uh with regards to

862
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,520
localization it's taken care now comes

863
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,260
about due diligence that we have to

864
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,780
exercise it I think

865
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,780
why wait for a law do it today

866
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,918
privacy is a key aspect for every person

867
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,320
sitting not only here but in India I

868
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,239
think it's something we have to do

869
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,540
essentially today take permissions take

870
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,320
consent process only as much as you need

871
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,320
and if your services are that good your

872
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
customers will want to share more with

873
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,560
you

874
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,719
having said that we already know that

875
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,879
everybody's data is out there and it's

876
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,520
leaking this is multiple times yeah yeah

877
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,460
let me just add to that see what we have

878
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,339
also started doing is like we say a

879
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,680
design security by Design and all that

880
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,000
so these days we are talking about

881
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,700
privacy by Design right so I write at

882
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,680
the design stage you take care of all

883
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,099
the aspects of data privacy so it will

884
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,420
come naturally

885
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,220
so another question with respect to the

886
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,500
law in place like certain India has got

887
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,680
a new law of sick reporting institution

888
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,440
six hours and maintaining a 180 days of

889
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,140
backup what is Cesar's views on that how

890
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,640
has it been taken in the industry

891
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,859
outside so I'll tell you because we

892
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,480
speak to law see so I think systems are

893
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,540
taking that very seriously a uh I think

894
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,700
the first part was even ntp clocks now

895
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,500
why did the ntp clock sync requests come

896
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,540
in because if you are certain and you

897
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,820
are seeing attack on a sector and even a

898
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,839
three minute time difference between

899
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,940
five companies logs and finances go for

900
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,880
a toss so the logic behind that is to

901
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,440
safeguard the country to make it more

902
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,859
secure uh as it was preparing for it yes

903
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,079
myself at about 43 sessions with

904
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,820
different csos with one PE company

905
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,579
having 87 investments in India so yeah

906
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,160
csos are talking about it many of them

907
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,839
have begun the compliance Journey some

908
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:07,920
are finished some are on different

909
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,920
phases but more and less by and large

910
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,140
uh we had 87th on a mind map exercise

911
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,000
where they came and contributed

912
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,619
so they are talking they are in

913
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,599
different phases of compliance someone

914
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,359
accepted it open-handedly sayings wow

915
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,400
uses law to get more funding which is a

916
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,640
great smart move right tell the CEO CFOs

917
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,500
that this is a law you have to get

918
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,359
mandated give me more money get me a

919
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,460
stock provider first shock provider is

920
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,960
again great because you have a mandate

921
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,640
you can't report if you don't have logs

922
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,040
so the industry of cyber security has

923
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,960
also got a boom with that there are

924
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,599
positives they're hiring more more tools

925
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,160
or cyber being scored most Innovations

926
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,079
happening in cyber more startups are

927
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,020
happening in cyber so a lot of

928
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,880
subsequent cyber Goodwill which is

929
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,099
creating for the entire Cyber Market in

930
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,140
India most art of more people more jobs

931
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,960
more more ciso prominence

932
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,660
so those are positive things

933
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,359
absolutely

934
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,460
choice is a neck on the line one more

935
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,220
question where do you see India after

936
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,440
maybe five years in cyber security as

937
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,780
csos of prepared companies

938
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,000
look around you it's very promising

939
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,400
absolutely Cesar's point of view of the

940
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,099
revenue companies this is the future of

941
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,859
Caesars that's the future I take it that

942
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,560
way well said and I don't think we'll be

943
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,119
behind any other country in any form

944
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,119
it's a talent like this the only part is

945
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,980
how much of the silent remains in India

946
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,859
how much it goes abroad right if this

947
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,839
best talent and I'm sure people are

948
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,940
moving for this Talent why won't India

949
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,160
this is the future of cyber in India

950
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,099
yes sir the green t-shirt

951
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,920
two minutes yes I know

952
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,380
we talk a lot about sock operations Soul

953
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,020
Services these days so I was I just

954
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,460
wanted to tell you these days I thought

955
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,200
these guys go for last for 10 years late

956
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,780
off late so uh I just want to have a

957
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,780
take off your take on uh do you prefer

958
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,800
cloud or remote services like MDR and

959
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,839
those things or the on-site team

960
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:08,940
handling the operations of operations in

961
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,440
your control what is your take on that

962
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,900
remote or on premise stock operations

963
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,140
see uh technology or tool doesn't matter

964
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,780
what matters is people who can identify

965
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,540
the threats for you okay you can have an

966
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,339
on-prem tool or you can have a

967
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,440
cloud-based okay

968
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,260
but finally what matters is people who

969
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,000
can identify threats or who can do

970
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,339
thread hunting for you and help you out

971
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,800
in identifying such proactive I'll

972
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,180
answer your question with the saying the

973
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,980
whole English saying it says cut your

974
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,960
quote cloth according to the size it

975
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,940
doesn't really matter you know if you

976
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,920
got more money to spend do it in-house

977
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,920
but it doesn't mean offside is bad many

978
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,240
companies are doing offside and doing

979
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,280
equally good but if you got more money

980
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,780
if you got more funding if you have more

981
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,700
regulation you're working for big bucks

982
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,500
have it in a house perfectly all right

983
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,780
one last question sorry to be honest

984
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,119
just to add that if it's the same cost

985
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,700
same functionality I think I would

986
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,260
rather my personal opinion I would

987
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,000
rather prefer Cloud because it takes a

988
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,619
lot of you know kind of underlying

989
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,960
infrastructure management from you there

990
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,520
could be certain challenges from a

991
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,260
regulatory or legal compliances

992
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,000
perspective you know where the data is

993
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,680
Flowing how it is being tracked there

994
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,000
could be certain clients who could

995
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,460
influence you but if everything is taken

996
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,800
care of I think cloud is something you

997
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
know my preference okay last one minute

998
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,420
you have a question and then I'll ask my

999
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,640
own yep

1000
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,800
go ahead

1001
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,320
hello yeah so my question is essentially

1002
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
kind of echoing to a lot of factors that

1003
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,760
we spoke about one of them being reduced

1004
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,440
time to market right so when we talk

1005
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,180
about reduced time to Market we start

1006
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,640
developing decentralized trucks like

1007
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,359
cloud socs or like uh my cyber security

1008
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,880
workloads being managed in the cloud or

1009
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,720
I start talking about uh trusting uh

1010
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,599
trusting something like your ID right to

1011
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,119
manage my credentials but when I'm doing

1012
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,740
all of that one thing that I'm

1013
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,420
developing is

1014
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,640
security being somebody else's

1015
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,460
responsibility and me monitoring them

1016
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,980
right which is which is where posture

1017
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,859
becomes a very critical aspect that I'm

1018
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,619
looking at say something like

1019
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,540
something like obsidian doing a lot of

1020
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,119
work for me or something like a posture

1021
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,220
management giving me a certification to

1022
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,079
prove whether security is good for me or

1023
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,720
not but with that what's the question so

1024
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,060
with that being said how does that come

1025
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,160
into the perspective of csos adopting

1026
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,460
decentralized trust for a security uh

1027
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,099
service in general I'll answer your

1028
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,240
first question and give to the audience

1029
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,339
I think whoever does it for you

1030
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,920
responsibility fair and square lies on

1031
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,200
seesaw shoulders there's no way you

1032
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,460
could say somebody else's problem

1033
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,359
Jackson can add more to that

1034
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:52,740
it's it's my problem

1035
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,220
I in I can Outsource to Kingdom Come I

1036
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,380
could be the only person left in the

1037
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,359
entire Security Department

1038
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,180
but if anything happens it's my problem

1039
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,000
so there is no accountability finally

1040
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,740
rest but having said that I just want to

1041
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,800
add see shifting it outside doesn't mean

1042
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,460
see I I understand when your Caesar's

1043
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,440
vocabulary this might sound very mundane

1044
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,780
and boring but governance plays a huge

1045
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,920
role over here

1046
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,960
if you do and when I say governance it

1047
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,880
adds the aspect of what Burgess has been

1048
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,980
speaking about you can't govern a

1049
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,140
partner on cyber security if you don't

1050
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,660
understand cyber security if your go-to

1051
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,820
Market is I don't know maybe two weeks

1052
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,240
because you're that great at it

1053
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,880
it should include security if yours if

1054
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,560
your security is not inbuilt into that

1055
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,900
go to market strategy for two weeks then

1056
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,579
I'm sorry you are a bad product

1057
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,920
developer because you have in factored

1058
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,740
that in you don't sell a car without the

1059
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,880
tires right

1060
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,700
why would you sell a software no matter

1061
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,280
how great it is without it being secure

1062
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,920
same reason so last set of two questions

1063
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,619
Jackson rightly mentioned the future of

1064
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,300
India as in Talent out here

1065
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,599
if you as a future Talent had a mentee

1066
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,760
mental relationship what would be your

1067
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,400
ask of csos and then as closing comments

1068
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,140
the cease will give it back to you what

1069
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,300
will be their ask of you when they would

1070
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,920
go and future build their teams with you

1071
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,680
and as as audience members so audience

1072
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,839
if you had to have a mentor mental

1073
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,300
relationship with the best csos what

1074
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,280
would be your aspiration or ask of these

1075
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,339
csos

1076
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,060
anybody

1077
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,800
what do we ask of resource what would

1078
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,440
you expect them to to be in life

1079
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,780
to be able to have yeah go ahead

1080
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,320
seesaw's next

1081
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,079
career path okay so you want to dislodge

1082
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,700
him so you want to take his place

1083
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,359
I mean no that's how you know right

1084
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,060
they're becoming threat okay I'll answer

1085
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,740
that anybody else what is your advice or

1086
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,839
request of csos audience

1087
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,079
yeah yeah three four hands up

1088
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,119
actually actually that's something

1089
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,000
similar to the question there so uh how

1090
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,760
does a CSO supposed to react when they

1091
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,280
are threatened by a emerging threat or

1092
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,800
the destructive threat so how do they

1093
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,480
make sure that their career is not

1094
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,619
threatened

1095
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,130
okay so next and take yeah here

1096
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,199
[Music]

1097
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,560
and then chosen comments from each of

1098
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,680
you

1099
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,830
[Laughter]

1100
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,240
I'd like to say since you told about the

1101
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,099
mentor mentee relation how we can build

1102
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,619
so uh because I am very new to uh

1103
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,260
security so often like sometimes I reach

1104
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,880
out to people for advice so I understand

1105
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,220
that being a c so you are very busy so I

1106
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,040
believe uh ever if you want to build a

1107
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,780
good relation with the younger

1108
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,520
generation these days like we have

1109
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,980
LinkedIn and Twitter maybe you should uh

1110
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,540
take out some time from a busy schedule

1111
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,400
and maybe you can uh answer some

1112
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,640
questions like uh recently I uh asked a

1113
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,040
few questions to uh one of the system of

1114
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,200
a big company uh Indian company I asked

1115
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,819
him like how I should grow if even today

1116
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,500
in the breakfast when talk right when I

1117
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,240
ask you like how how I should prove my

1118
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,880
career then you you so advices listed

1119
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,980
and talked more to a young generation so

1120
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,240
you can get inputs that's a very valid

1121
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,560
point Thank you so often it's very

1122
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,180
difficult for us to connect with you

1123
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,220
it's very difficult so if that you guys

1124
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,760
can be reached no no why why are we so

1125
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,619
difficult to connect is there a

1126
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:29,819
perception or is it reality is it

1127
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,280
perception or reality it's uh some kind

1128
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,200
of perception also and also it's a

1129
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,880
reality but I can understand that you

1130
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,760
are very busy but maybe uh csos or

1131
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,040
people in the higher uh position they

1132
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,900
should take out some time and talk with

1133
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,400
the younger generation and ask there is

1134
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,260
a very valid point even if you don't do

1135
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,160
it do it if you're doing it great

1136
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,560
continue it so thank you so starting

1137
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,480
from you you are closing comments future

1138
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,160
generation technology is the best guys

1139
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,800
to hire what's your advice to them

1140
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,619
I think talk talk to us more we are

1141
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,960
reachable nobody I think in our in our

1142
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,339
community will feel like you can't reach

1143
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,319
out to us you reach out to us but then I

1144
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,359
think my motive finally as somebody asks

1145
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,099
you know what is our career provision

1146
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,079
from now I would love to create more ESO

1147
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,660
in the industry and I think make change

1148
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,160
to the world I think there are many

1149
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,720
deceptions happening in this industry

1150
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,339
there are more companies coming in in

1151
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,040
India we would need more csos which are

1152
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,380
which can handle such such scale thank

1153
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,400
you

1154
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,880
sure uh so I think my advice would be uh

1155
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,400
I think like I think the Snell con it's

1156
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,020
all very hardcore technical you know

1157
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,880
kind of sessions workshops happening and

1158
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,440
it's really you know kind of very

1159
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,940
exciting to see these kind of

1160
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,579
discussions and workshops happening at a

1161
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,859
large scale so I think I'm very uh I

1162
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:43,319
would say happy to see that the future

1163
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,900
generation which is coming up is very

1164
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,760
well on you know on the cyber security

1165
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,280
landscape from a defensive and offensive

1166
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,160
both perspective keep learning that and

1167
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,260
you know more and more Hands-On that you

1168
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,940
get in you know kind of this phase of

1169
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,819
your life is gonna lay a very great and

1170
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,099
you know a solid foundation although the

1171
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,599
transformation is happening you know

1172
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,140
very fast and as you become uh see so

1173
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,119
maybe you know whatever time down the

1174
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,920
line the Technologies and all will keep

1175
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,680
on changing but more and more technology

1176
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,240
fundamentals and you know the

1177
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,740
foundational layers that you keep making

1178

strong will always help you that will

1179

always remain with you so that would be

1180
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,619
my advice to you guys thanks Kumar the

1181
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,060
more technical the more employable the

1182
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,380
more they can take your role as you

1183
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,000
mentioned that's okay that happens

1184

1186
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,259
I've

1187
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,500
done me amazing products and amazing

1188
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,660
work that they're doing at the end of

1189
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,319
the day sell value no products when you

1190
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,720
are talking not just to a Caesar to a

1191
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,260
CIO to a CEO sell value not products

1192
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,839
they if they don't see value in what you

1193
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,160
are giving them

1194
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,020
it doesn't matter how great your product

1195
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,960
is so remember that when you talk and

1196
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,960
engage senior leaders well done thanks

1197
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,540

1198
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,180
of you during the day okay so you guys

1199

1203
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,940
you are talking with a CSO or any of the

1204
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,280
leaders no it's value which always

1205
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,680
matters okay so as long as you are able

1206
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,200
to sell that value or give that value

1207
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,440
