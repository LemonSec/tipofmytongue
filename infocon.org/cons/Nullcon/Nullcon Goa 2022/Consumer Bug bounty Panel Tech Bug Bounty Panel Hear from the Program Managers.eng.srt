1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,700
hello

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,099
all right welcome everyone

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,460
so I'll give this mic

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,559
so couple of housekeeping items before

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,800
we start have a seat oh looks like I'm

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,980
on the other end so just to kind of okay

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,800
so yeah couple of housekeeping items

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
before we move so this is a 45 minute

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,199
panel discussion uh we'll have we'll

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,420
touch upon certain topics in the next 30

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,000
minutes and then we'll open it for Q a

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,739
uh for the audience uh for people uh in

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,020
the panel some of the takeaways for you

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,020
should be uh will be discussing like you

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,420
heard there are folks who are running

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,280
active bug bunny programs who are

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,260
running uh bug Bounty programs in

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,360
different capacities in different kind

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,700
of Industries Etc so we'll learn from

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,800
their experiences we'll hear uh the

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,320
challenges we'll hear the doubts that we

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,059
keep hearing from a lot of folks in the

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,980
industry and community and we'll try to

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,140
like you know the the objective should

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,400
be that if you're thinking of starting a

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,900
bug Bounty program or if you're thinking

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,580
or if you want to understand what goes

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,220
behind the scenes uh this should be a

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,920
place for you and then we also have a

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,659
slightly different perspective from uh

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,939
from a Consulting from a product space

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,700
wherein working with customers how uh

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,740
venkatesh might have seen different

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,180
situations

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,759
so all right so I'll kick things off and

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,340
as the panel says that the title says

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,960
that you know it's it's learning from

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
the program owners and program managers

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,060
of bug Bounty programs and um sandish

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,700
I'll come to you first so since you're a

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,100
fintech company recently gone through a

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,259
lot of bug Bounty changes as we are

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,060
aware so can you talk about like what

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,220
prompted you your company to start a

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,759
program uh yeah yeah so uh we so recipe

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,799
we've been running a bug Bounty program

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,840
for a little over a year now

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,100
um the first nine months of that was

49
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,780
actually a private program and a few

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,040
months ago we went public to the program

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,200
okay and um you know and we were

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,820
thinking about launching a bug boundary

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,140
program for at least like six to nine

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,239
months before that okay and and I think

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,739
um so we've been running a pretty

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,360
successful responsible vulnerability

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,860
disclosure program even before that on

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,000
our website

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,620
um if this was this is happening for

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,360
many years at Razer pay but what we kind

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,459
of realize is that um you know it was

62
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,140
much harder to kind of interact and

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,520
encourage more researchers to

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
participate and also like a logistical

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
issue of you know how do you make

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,440
payments to

67
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,060
hacker in Paris who reports something

68
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,739
right okay it looks very different in a

69
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,120
balance sheet right somebody did

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,260
something to you and you paid the money

71
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,819
yeah yeah it sounds very different

72
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,319
outside the security world yeah right so

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,760
we kind of figured out that having an

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,840
actual program

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,340
um it streamlines many of those things

76
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,080
okay and also of course you know having

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,300
having a lot more people look at our

78
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,519
platforms make sense but we just wanted

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
to make sure we are ready for the

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,019
Avalanche right okay so so we decided we

81
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,220
want to do it and then spend a few

82
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,959
months preparing for it and then you

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,760
know took the plunge yeah that's just

84
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,280
good and and I mean you know continuing

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,379
on that Omar you also have a similar

86
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,200
kind of uh situation and similar kind of

87
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
program so I want to understand like uh

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,900
in in large organization like yours Ikea

89
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,480
for example uh how does this fits into

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
the overall Broaddus like cyber security

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,140
strategy what does the board thinks

92
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,120
about like bug body program what value

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,220
is it adding and and what are you trying

94
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,780
to kind of where are you trying to go

95
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,659
with it yeah one of uh well the most

96
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,440
important thing foreign

97
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,260
part of cyber security we are part of

98
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,180
the community we love hackers we love

99
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,640
researchers and that's something that we

100
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,420
want to have close to us so it was not

101
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,519
complicated to have this program

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
and it was quite easy compared to other

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,940
companies that I have experienced before

104
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,099
and the idea is to to approach the

105
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,959
community and the hackers and have them

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,420
in our site it's much better to be

107
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,920
friends of hackers than the enemies

108
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,239
right so that's a good idea no and it's

109
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,840
a good also to not just

110
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,819
having a bad day or responsible

111
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,340
discussion as part of your company but

112
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,159
what are the learnings from that because

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,918
every single attack has a different way

114
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,160
so we are learning a lot for with each

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,440
and every report that we are getting and

116
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,900
also this is uh helping us to develop

117
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,759
our capabilities in for example or

118
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,800
Apprentice team yeah so that we can

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,040
verify uh those uh backs or information

120
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,500
in other assets that were not reported

121
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,900
before okay yeah perfect and I think

122
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,479
I'll take that to wanky you as well uh

123
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,520
coming from the industry working so many

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,800
years and is there any Trend you're

125
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,440
seeing these days like how does the bug

126
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,960
Bounty thing fits into the cyber

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,180
security strategy at the board level or

128
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,759
at the leadership level in companies

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,180
I think in India bug Bounty is just in

130
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,419
the early so it's it's just mushrooming

131
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,000
right now very few companies who in

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,580
India at least have are running about

133
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,220
Bounty program but certainly the need

134
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,440
for security

135
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,780
uh is the question of uh what does it

136
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,100
have a discussion at the boardroom

137
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,259
certainly is I don't have to preach the

138
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,419
need for security anymore to anyone in

139
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,460
any business yeah everybody understands

140
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,280
it uh but only very few have reached a

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,500
maturity level to actually run a bug

142
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,259
Bounty program but a lot of them are

143
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,500
trying to look at tools to do the

144
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,880
internal compliance and security

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,160
assessments themselves okay yeah that

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,199
sounds good and and Omar to your point I

147
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,060
would like to add that you know uh we've

148
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,979
worked with some companies wherein

149
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,580
they've used the patterns in findings in

150
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,039
bug Bounty programs to to educate their

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,840
developers by running security like

152
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,960
developer education workshops and and

153
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,539
try to fix bug classes just by learning

154
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,460
from bug like the patterns that they see

155
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,900
with their bug bunny programs combined

156
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,639
with security assessments and and other

157
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,620
things that they've done and that feeds

158
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,960
really well into the like whole uh you

159
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
know proactive security side as well

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
like you can learn from those things

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,300
feed it back to your developers uh and

162
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,639
kind of thing so yeah definitely uh all

163
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,740
right so I'll come to you rishika now

164
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,539
because you run one of the most

165
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,820
challenging programs I would say uh

166
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,940
Android chipset program not an easy kind

167
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,000
of you know setup kind of thing so now

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,180
when things like devices chipsets these

169
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,860
kind of things come into picture

170
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,680
it the getting the buy-in becomes like

171
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,139
four times five times difficult so how

172
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,060
do you convince people to kind of you

173
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,860
know uh give you the buy for learning

174
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,740
programs like that sure yeah I mean uh

175
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,380
honestly the whole idea is not to just

176
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,199
work on Android or secure Android but

177
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,380
the uh entire ecosystem right so when I

178
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,300
say chipset vulnerability program every

179
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,460
one of you carrying a phone here has a

180
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,319
chip you might not even know what

181
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,880
company is making it and what all

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
vulnerabilities are in there so that's

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
how we are trying to attack so when I

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,300
talk in terms of getting approval from

185
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,720
stakeholders that's the point you need

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,539
to make right we we really want to just

187
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,259
not focus on web or Os or just Android

188
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,039
itself but actually what happens in

189
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,380
inside your phone or the hardware or the

190
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,419
devices so we are really trying hard to

191
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,979
cover everything

192
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,020
to keep the ecosystem secure did I

193
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,360
answer your question yeah yeah yeah in a

194
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,699
way and uh

195
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,759
okay so I think I'll stick to this point

196
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,300
a bit because I can sense that there

197
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,880
will be a lot of fear in in these kind

198
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,979
of scenarios that okay if there is a bug

199
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,840
that comes in and that disrupts the

200
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,060
supply chain of the whole chip ecosystem

201
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,580
that will be a lot of cost the cost of

202
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,199
fixing that bug would be really high

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
okay so does that plays a role when the

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
management gives you a buy-in or like

205
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
when they're thinking about these

206
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
programs yeah yeah definitely and also

207
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,139
because we are not owner of the code

208
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,180
that's the biggest challenge like I need

209
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,259
to work with corecom mediatek uh unicorn

210
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:09,539
unisoc to um you know secure the code so

211
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,340
we just not need buy-in from our

212
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,960
stakeholders we actually need those

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,780
companies to help us remediate or

214
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,539
mitigate if they cannot remediate right

215
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,500
so yes I mean we definitely it's a big

216
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,599
challenging program but I think it

217
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,080
requires everyone's uh you know all the

218
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,300
stakeholders approvals and participation

219
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,520
to make it a success yeah yeah

220
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,159
absolutely and yeah I have one I want

221
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,799
the thing regarding this because uh many

222
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,899
times we are getting reports that are

223
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,458
related to something that we are running

224
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,399
but it's not ours of course yeah but one

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,740
topic that is super important for us is

226
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,140
to help researchers to reach out with

227
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,120
their real company that is running down

228
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
yeah yeah so we are helping and

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,899
supporting researchers to find out the

230
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,720
way and get for example the cve number

231
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,320
yeah the credit for that so of course we

232
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,959
need to secure ourselves but we are

233
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,120
helping the researchers to find the way

234
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
and to communicate with the right

235
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
company as well so we are doing like

236
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,779
that money in the middle let's say yeah

237
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,240
yeah yeah and that's a really good point

238
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,279
because we've been struggling a bit with

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,100
this is we get a lot of reports uh for

240
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,720
customers let's say for example raise up

241
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,180
a an asset owned by a resume which laser

242
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,860
pay does not kind of it's a third party

243
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,160
asset now raise a pay if there's a zero

244
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,660
day on that Razer pay can not do

245
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,339
anything Ikea cannot do anything on that

246
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,880
but we still encourage uh companies to

247
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,220
kind of uh you know go to talk to their

248
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,140
vendors that puts a pressure on the

249
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,580
vendor to kind of fix because the

250
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,860
customer is demanding yeah I mean you're

251
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,000
right but I look at it a little

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
differently okay so it doesn't matter

253
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,839
who owns the code the risk is still ours

254
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,880
yes the risk if you're able to exploit a

255
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,380
company because of a bug in your supply

256
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,060
chain it's still yours yeah so if you

257
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,620
look at it from that perspective it's in

258
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,300
the end about risk management so your

259
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,740
risk management can we go fix the code

260
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,620
or go talk to a vendor yeah um it's it's

261
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,839
still you go to exactly so yeah you're

262
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,519
right we look at from a risk perspective

263
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,260
as well like the risk is yours you

264
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,940
should be aware of the risk and and

265
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
that's why you should be informed of

266
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,540
such issues as well well that was that

267
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,560
was good now uh okay slightly pivoting

268
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,380
now going on the researcher side and a

269
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,540
big part of learning programs is working

270
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,120
with external researchers okay and we

271
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,680
have a lot of security researchers here

272
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,260
okay uh and so I'd like to just start

273
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,660
with like you know with all of you uh in

274
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,000
your different capacities like what your

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,860
experience has been working with

276
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,839
external security researcher is there

277
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,339
anything that stands out is there

278
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,360
anything that you'd like to share

279
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,240
anything surprised you or like anything

280
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,980
that you would like to kind of you know

281
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,800
yeah I can go ahead I think uh I was

282
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,420
telling this to one of our top research

283
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,579
today he's sitting there am I

284
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,440
um

285
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,060
having this transparency about the

286
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,760
program right even if we make mistake it

287
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,560
goes in the favor of researchers right

288
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,079
it's like that we are we have values and

289
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,899
we stand by those values and I think I

290
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,600
would say keeping researchers happy in

291
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,519
um different ways there are of course

292
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,100
but being transparent with them is very

293
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,399
very important you know having uh clear

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,839
Communications and regular

295
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
Communications to make them feel that

296
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
they are heard they are listened and we

297
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,480
are keeping in touch with them that

298
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,459
really works for us yeah I mean I can't

299
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,500
emphasize more on the transparency part

300
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,600
like hands down the most important thing

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,220
that you need in a bug Bounty program

302
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,000
yeah uh my keyword is transparency so

303
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
it's uh okay so we have a second

304
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,339
transference so and um and also uh

305
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,640
another topic that I love

306
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,640
uh the small work in cyber security yeah

307
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,860
is uh the opportunity that we have to

308
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,899
meet with the researchers uh not only

309
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,260
nircon but uh any conference yeah

310
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,420
researchers are everywhere and it's

311
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,180
super nice to meet the guys face to face

312
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,300
yeah yeah so because we we have a super

313
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,180
uh close contact with with them at the

314
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,519
end of the day so it's uh they are not

315
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,800
uh or co-workers but they are part of

316
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,100
the the whole idea so it's a it's

317
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,740
something brilliant to to write no I

318
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,019
think that also plays from a researcher

319
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,339
side I've spoken to this a lot of

320
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,959
researchers and they say the more

321
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,180
engaged program is with them the more

322
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,040
they talk to them the more they feel

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,839
connected and want to work on those

324
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,760
programs so that definitely plays a role

325
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,980
yeah and one of the things that uh

326
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,500
for example in my case it's like there

327
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,360
are a lot of communities in the

328
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,959
researcher not hacker community and they

329
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,000
are creating the telegram groups about

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,220
the backbone D programs or whatever you

331
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,440
know it's a really nice feeling when

332
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,540
they are inviting you to one of those to

333
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,820
to give your input as well from a

334
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,459
company perspective to give advice or

335
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,100
support on that so it's a learning as

336
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,839
well

337
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,579
yeah so I think you know we are very

338
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,899
early in the journey compared to cup so

339
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,940
we have a lot to learn from Google and

340
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,139
Ikea and stuff

341
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,060
um largely an experience has been more

342
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,639
positive than we expected so we expected

343
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,560
a lot more resistance in back and forth

344
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,639
so we had some of that but I think it

345
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,920
was largely positive and I think the one

346
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,899
thing we have to figure out as a company

347
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,339
or as a community is the how much

348
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,600
bandwidth can you dedicate to

349
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,519
communicating with them right so I think

350
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,079
that has changed for us over time so we

351
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,279
figured out that there are certain

352
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,459
things you can do which which means you

353
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,779
communicate you still communicate at the

354
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,220
right space but there are times when you

355
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,420
can like you know back off and not go

356
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,920
yeah yeah so yeah so I think figuring

357
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,920
out that that kind of balance is really

358
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,779
important and there's always like a band

359
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,240
everyone has a Bad Touch yeah so we'll

360
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,800
just have to figure out the balance but

361
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,720
but in general I think uh the experience

362
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,760
when we were very nervous going in yeah

363
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,139
but you know we're a lot more relaxed

364
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,120
now 12 months later okay yeah yeah

365
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,160
that's fair yeah thank you like what

366
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,360
have you seen with your customers

367
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,940
specifically more than my customers I

368
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,680
think foundational as a product owner

369
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,560
yeah a business owner where

370
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,440
the core IP and the capabilities that

371
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,300
they're building in my business is based

372
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,700
on researchers yeah based on which the

373
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,839
product and Automation and everything

374
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,019
happens and what me as a founder and

375
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,399
business owner drives me is customer

376
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,040
wins Revenue SAS revenue and gross

377
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,839
margin growth yeah

378
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,700
security resistors don't care about it

379
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,600
yeah so in a product company where I'm

380
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,459
building this value significant value

381
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,680
based on security researchers yeah I had

382
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,260
to I cannot talk I mean customer wins

383
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,180
and grow doesn't matter it's all about

384
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,620
the new vulnerability that they found

385
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,600
out the new way of doing things and I

386
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,880
think you mentioned about glories the

387
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,920
cvid and the glory point right the glory

388
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,959
point wearing there is a badge of honor

389
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,519
so it's a product company there's a

390
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,139
different set of challenges that we face

391
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,600
but fundamentally the talent pool that

392
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,040
we both get to is the same set of people

393
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,260
security researchers Building Product

394
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,480
and therefore I think the responsibility

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,940
for security products uh the bar is

396
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,440
higher like you know when you're trying

397
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,959
to secure others your products should be

398
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,139
like very very secure yeah and there is

399
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,579
a lot of conversation that will be a

400
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,139
different pattern on that but yeah

401
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,240
that's that's a good point but I think

402
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,339
I'll add just one one last thing right

403
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,740
um other than transparency and

404
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,540
everything we talked about and getting

405
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,240
regular feedback yeah

406
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
super important I think

407
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
but anyways my

408
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,040
mind thank you

409
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,680
so yeah what I was saying is uh we

410
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,440
really try to get feedback every quarter

411
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,660
and then work on that feedback right

412
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,240
feed getting feedback is important of

413
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
course but if you're not working on it

414
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,779
then that doesn't make sense so that is

415
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,000
again highly recommended yep yeah

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,760
absolutely I mean I've seen uh you know

417
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,740
customer starting programs and like

418
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,779
sandesh you mentioned really nicely that

419
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,320
uh companies mature over time and the

420
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
only way they can mature is when they

421
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,300
have constant feedback I've seen the way

422
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,339
of communication has changed in programs

423
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,959
I've seen the engagement has changed

424
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,279
just because of the feedbacks that

425
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,380
they've received so yeah that definitely

426
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,420
transparency feedback you know again

427
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,740
acknowledging researchers as much as

428
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,620
possible some good points yeah all right

429
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,519
so slightly pivoting uh Foundation this

430
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,740
would uh go to you because you're a

431
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,720
fairly new program

432
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,839
after starting the bug Bounty program

433
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,339
did you find something and you don't

434
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,320
have to talk about the bug itself but

435
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
more generally like did you find

436
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,980
something that was surprising for you

437
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,620
from uh and and that kind of you know

438
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,260
also adds like you can add it in a way

439
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,740
that it kind of demonstrated the risk in

440
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,620
a much more glaring way to the board or

441
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,660
to the company leadership in it was

442
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,399
there any any situation

443
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,000
yeah so a cup um okay so a couple of

444
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,100
points right so I think one and we have

445
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,540
a talk about this right after that okay

446
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,060
so yeah be careful about it then uh but

447
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,440
I think I think the one thing we kind of

448
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,660
found out was um there were things

449
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,000
auxiliary to the whole vulnerability

450
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,860
Management program itself which things

451
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,240
like handling traffic and you know

452
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,740
monitoring dashboards going yeah all

453
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,480
crazy yeah you know when you get this

454
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,980
traffic and how do we manage that so

455
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,359
that was like pretty eye-opening to us

456
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,099
right so in our case um you know like

457
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,959
Omar said convincing the management was

458
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,520
not that hard but convincing our peers

459
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
in engineering yeah Incident Management

460
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,000
was hard because we were like wait we

461
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,319
are asking people to come to this to us

462
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,359
like it doesn't make sense right yeah

463
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,740
um so talking to them was interesting I

464
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,720
think that was so when we went public uh

465
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,699
we had like a big blip in traffic and

466
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,679
how do we manage that Etc so that was

467
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,299
that was a big learning for us yeah

468
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,280
um on your original question on kind of

469
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,140
communicating risk Etc I think what we

470
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,720
essentially did was um you know for uh

471
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,520
the consumers of the bug

472
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,020
um it didn't look any different from

473
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,660
what a pen testing okay right so we kind

474
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,039
of made it simpler for them because in

475
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,419
the end they like it's a security bug

476
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,039
and all the details that you usually get

477
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,660
yeah it doesn't matter I mean they knew

478
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,539
it came from hacker one so because

479
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:51,360
yeah but for them it didn't make any

480
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,700
difference at all whether it came from

481
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,140
here or from there right so it's again

482
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,299
yeah it's also like a mindset thing that

483
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,000
you kind of prepared them for uh that is

484
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,280
it's just a bug like yeah it's a bug and

485
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,600
you know it goes to the same life cycle

486
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,480
yeah now if it I mean again depending on

487
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,100
the severity and other things things

488
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,080
change but just because it's come from

489
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,299
an external researcher it doesn't uh

490
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,520
much yeah now that only works if your

491
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,140
teams are cooperative and actually fix

492
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,120
stuff yeah which luckily our teams do so

493
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,500
okay so we're okay with it but if it

494
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,640
didn't then you know we would have had a

495
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,100
slightly harder yeah and then that's a

496
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,720
good tangential point to the next

497
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,299
question is because we do have like 10

498
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,100
minutes and I want to cover this before

499
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,919
I go to the last uh part of it is like

500
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,039
what preparedness is important for bug

501
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
Bounty uh programs okay and and that

502
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,240
could be like you rightly mentioned when

503
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,799
you have a lot of bugs coming in maybe

504
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,660
your Intel internal teams are not ready

505
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,700
okay and all those that's just one

506
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
example but I'd like to hear from all of

507
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,299
you a bit as to like you know what do

508
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,679
you think is important in terms of

509
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,840
preparedness yeah one of the most

510
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
important things is to Define uh

511
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,740
properly at this goal of the program so

512
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,960
it's uh

513
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,120
super important that together with a

514
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
proper process and people skill people

515
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
there because it doesn't matter if you

516
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,960
are getting thousands of reports if you

517
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,460
don't have a proper process to answer

518
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,580
the researchers yeah uh fix that in a

519
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,280
Time manner I would say yeah providing

520
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,260
the information and also knowing to whom

521
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,299
you need to escalate the information or

522
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,720
the the report stuff so I I would say

523
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,179
that those are the most uh important

524
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,880
topics another thing is like and in the

525
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,919
way I want to treat the the researchers

526
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,020
is that that they

527
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,280
um feel that they are talking always

528
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,780
with the same people

529
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,780
so uh establish guidelines proper

530
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,360
guidelines and uh common answers or

531
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,820
whatever it's like in a structured way

532
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,160
that they are getting usually the same

533
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,360
information

534
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,720
not just because uh one engineer left

535
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
the company it's totally different the

536
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,820
way that they are approaching so that

537
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,740
makes the researchers also to feel happy

538
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,799
with you and yeah yeah that's that's a

539
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,120
very good point like you know

540
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,640
maintaining consistency throughout uh

541
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
time so yes yeah I mean I mean look to

542
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,559
me I think it's it's like any other

543
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,480
program management that you do like you

544
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,100
need to build contingencies you need to

545
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,660
make sure that you know you have uh

546
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,280
goals in place or you have a plan and

547
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,660
then you have the ability to change the

548
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,820
plan yeah you know if things change so I

549
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,320
think the one thing for us is you know

550
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,820
we were kind of hesitating a lot to go

551
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,260
public so in the end which is an all

552
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,580
that here are the things we're going to

553
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,559
do before we go back and once we do it

554
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,360
we're gonna turn on tap that's it right

555
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,220
so I think I think having um like a

556
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,200
rules based kind of program is better

557
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,620
than just uh say hey

558
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,780
we'll figure it out when it happens

559
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,760
right and of course I think if you don't

560
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,380
have a robust security program already

561
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,660
not a very good idea to go to bug body

562
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,100
like bug Mount is not a replacement for

563
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,500
your friends yeah yeah right so I think

564
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,700
um we kind of make sure that I think

565
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,020
that's probably the biggest advice I

566
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,039
would give to anyone thinking about

567
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,539
starting yeah you don't want to start

568
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,780
with you can't agree more on that so

569
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,980
yeah

570
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,840
I was going to say the last Point don't

571
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,400
start with the bug bounty in fact I have

572
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,340
seen many of my customers I talk when

573
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,200
they talk about we are planning to go

574
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,240
down the Bounty route because that's

575
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,980
what I keep hearing why should we look

576
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,140
at scanning pen testing web application

577
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,880
final and all these things and we say

578
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
that raise the bar

579
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,799
on the what the bug Bounty program and

580
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,419
others can find as opposed to making it

581
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,280
too easy for them so I think you

582
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,760
summarize it very beautifully there

583
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,840
yeah sure

584
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,760
um I think just like everyone already

585
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,799
covered about the scope but this one

586
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,419
thing which is super important is what

587
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,400
is your objective yeah what are you

588
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
really wanting to achieve with this

589
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,240
particular program and then I think

590
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,679
because everyone already talked about

591
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,260
the scope in process and guidelines it

592
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,100
is very very important to have a clearly

593
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,620
defined internal external policies and

594
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,720
guidelines like what will you do once

595
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,299
you receive the bug right you do not

596
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,539
want unhappy researchers so if you if

597
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,520
you receive like thousand reports and

598
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,620
you don't know how to fix them then I

599
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,720
think by end of the day the people will

600
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,240
just stop coming to your program so have

601
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,460
very clearly defined your objective

602
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,740
scope how will you assess the reports

603
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,919
how is the severity gonna look like once

604
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,360
you have everything figured out who's

605
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,400
gonna remediate the issue and then

606
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,740
finally how do you release that's the

607
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,320
entire life cycle yeah I think and to

608
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,940
add to what sandesh also said on the

609
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,640
program and inside like be prepared If

610
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,500
You're Expecting like hundreds of

611
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,539
reports you should have enough bandwidth

612
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,760
to handle those like you know triage to

613
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,280
mediate put them in the bug life cycle

614
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,440
and all that so yeah definitely yeah

615
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,419
just like last thought on it that's why

616
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,240
I always recommend like start small if

617
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,360
your company makes 10 devices only two

618
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,240
buck Bounty for one device see how it is

619
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,280
growing and then learn from there and

620
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,919
then move on and add more to scope do

621
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,840
not start with a big scope for bug

622
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
Bounty for sure yeah absolutely

623
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,700
absolutely okay so before we go to the

624
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,820
audience for Q a uh one last question

625
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,919
that I've kind of you know

626
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,440
want to take from you is like okay if

627
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,840
you have to give one practical piece of

628
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,080
advice let's say I am a company

629
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,580
reasonably okay security program I won't

630
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,740
say a well security program reasonably

631
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,260
okay security program do all my SAS

632
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,240
tasks security assessments all kind of

633
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,220
thing decent enough secure development

634
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,500
now I'm thinking of going in starting a

635
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,480
bug body program so where like what

636
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,460
practical advice would you give one to

637
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,620
anything that you any number like you

638
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,459
know for me to start

639
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,360
uh one practical advice before you start

640
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,419
up a bounty find the right researchers

641
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,419
right you want researchers who would

642
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,240
submit good reports uh when I say good

643
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,880
reports it should be a great park it

644
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,159
should have all the reproduction steps

645
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,860
it's the guy or the team should know

646
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,740
what they're doing uh because honestly

647
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,600
like when we started we used to get a

648
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,760
lot of junk reports and then it becomes

649
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,700
overwhelming to segregate between good

650
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,280
ones and the bad ones

651
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,720
another suggestion is while you are

652
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,580
launching it on a website or with the

653
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,520
rules or whatever always mention what

654
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,580
makes a good report right it's very very

655
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,220
required like every company has a

656
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,559
different requirement and if you are not

657
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,900
clearly defining for the researcher what

658
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,299
exactly he should be submitting then

659
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,640
it's waste of time right on both ends so

660
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,240
that is very much required

661
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,460
and added to that uh also include

662
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,140
information about what is out of the

663
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,299
scope in the in the programs and what

664
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,679
are the vulnerabilities that you are not

665
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,659
accepting just to avoid deception from

666
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,480
the researchers and in order to engage

667
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,120
them uh is super important to have

668
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,299
proper guidelines uh a playbooks on your

669
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,059
side so you can resolve and provide

670
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,039
answers as soon as possible so they

671
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,159
don't need to wait for a long time uh of

672
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,440
course sometimes it's uh something that

673
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
is super difficult because uh mainly

674
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,820
with big companies with a huge number of

675
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,880
assets that makes that complicated but

676
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
is uh well an advice

677
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,919
that's a good one I mean I I don't have

678
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,240
much else I think start small is really

679
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,280
good yeah that's probably the most

680
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,020
important and I guess the other thing is

681
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,760
just be prepared for your plan to kind

682
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,280
of be completely get overturned because

683
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,360
of things you didn't see coming yeah

684
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,100
right so you need to be nimbled and make

685
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,779
sure that you have enough contingency to

686
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,520
change yeah but yeah I I think there are

687
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,659
a lot more things on the technical side

688
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,260
but it depends on what

689
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,340
but I think technical controls

690
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,679
monitoring stuff yeah workflows

691
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,700
internally all those are like really

692
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,740
important but and also to be honest I

693
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,059
mean while we say all this I don't think

694
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,260
you need to be like 100 ready

695
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,360
everything's all go before you start

696
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,220
it's not going to happen yeah yeah so I

697
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,840
mean I I think you need to have like a

698
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,120
slightly kind of risk taking yeah like

699
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,000
Utopia doesn't exist yeah yeah so you've

700
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,960
got to go in thinking it's going to be

701
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,179
risky to do this but there is value at

702
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,880
the end of the chain so okay fair enough

703
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,200
thank you

704
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,260
I don't run bug quantity programs yet I

705
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,480
work with companies who because of

706
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,100
companies like hacker one and others

707
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,740
talking so highly about the results from

708
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,080
the bug body program they read some

709
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
thing and say that I am looking at this

710
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,380
bug Bounty program why do I need you and

711
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,919
I tell them that you need me before the

712
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,039
bug Bounty program fair enough yeah yeah

713
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,539
for our products yeah yeah absolutely

714
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,120
Fair Point and and I mean just one piece

715
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,679
of thing that I would like to add and

716
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,260
that's slightly technical is like if you

717
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,919
have a bit unconventional scope or where

718
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,020
you want the researchers to go when

719
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,900
testing your assets direct them that way

720
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,000
so the way you can direct them is have

721
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,159
clear testing plan like tell them that

722
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,140
you know you should go this way looking

723
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,880
for this this is where we are hosting

724
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,860
this this is where we do don't let them

725
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,980
waste their time uh in in unnecessary

726
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,080
areas or at unnecessary places where

727
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,340
they have to figure out or they get

728
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,020
frustrated or they'll get duplicated and

729
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,179
all the those kind of things so that's a

730
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:01,980
really good point so we kind of so razor

731
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,419
pay mostly is a you know is used by

732
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,159
other businesses so it's not a consumer

733
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,200
facing app yeah so a lot of the use

734
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,539
cases that happen is not obvious to end

735
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,000
users yeah it was an obviously yeah yeah

736
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,980
so I think it's I mean luckily we have

737
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,720
like really good documentation yeah but

738
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,460
it's important to point to them that

739
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,140
exactly and we kind of I think if you

740
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,640
remember correctly we saw like a change

741
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,020
I mean so initially for the first few

742
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,279
months we had like decent traffic yeah

743
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,659
and then there was a few weeks where we

744
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,120
really uh updated the The Links of the

745
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,260
documents and made sure they had the

746
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,640
information and then we saw higher

747
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,320
quality reports kind of coming in a few

748
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,000
months now so yeah so like you said if

749
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,380
you're not a consumer facing company

750
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,179
which is very obvious to all these users

751
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,059
yeah um it kind of helps right and also

752
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,559
um our products are very specific to

753
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,539
India so something like pan verification

754
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,100
or yeah some stuff doesn't make sense

755
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,779
for most other researchers so you can

756
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,039
actually make it in such a way that you

757
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,779
know you can generalize it in the global

758
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,520
audiences that's that's a really good

759
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,919
one yeah all right so I think we're 30

760
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,140
minutes I think the remaining 15 minutes

761
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,480
if you want to do uh open it for

762
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,200
questions from the public so yeah we

763
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,820
have the first question and we have the

764
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,400
second question okay okay so run this

765
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,500
bug Bounty program so do you really need

766
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,960
to onboard with those uh platform like

767
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,440
bug cloud or trust radius Rucker one or

768
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,679
because it's cost money right so can you

769
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,779
start with Nimble maybe something on

770
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,700
your own or what's experience it was

771
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,460
what's the suggestions around that

772
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,760
yeah well uh it helps of course that

773
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,520
helps because you will have a platform

774
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,059
to deal with you don't need to um break

775
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,520
your head uh with the payments and all

776
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,400
that stuff because at the end you uh

777
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,799
depends on what is your real scope and

778
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,360
the people that you want to to submit

779
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,000
the stuff but if it's a worldwide uh

780
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,919
then definitely that's a an important

781
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,740
topic to go with the platform

782
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,299
um I had experience from the previous

783
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,460
years through running that without a

784
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,100
platform and I was mentioning before the

785
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,320
the meeting that was the first day that

786
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,640
we opened that we got the 2 500 emails

787
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,279
regarding vulnerabilities so it's uh it

788
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
was well uh all your system ticketing

789
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,779
system and it was super hard to manage

790
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:12,919
that in uh on that way so

791
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,299
yeah I mean you can probably start with

792
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,679
like a responsible vulnerability

793
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,419
disclosure on your page and then if you

794
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:19,620
want to really test your Waters you can

795
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,120
start handing out bounties you don't

796
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,740
have to commit to it but you can have if

797
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,940
somebody goes in a really good report

798
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,440
you can find a way to give them bounties

799
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
right but like you said if it's like a

800
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,620
cross-border payment then you know your

801
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,940
your Finance team is not going to be

802
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,919
happy like sending money abroad right

803
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
and and and and you know initially the

804
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,520
response numbers here we'll just still

805
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,620
send swag right and then we started this

806
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,600
program in covid and shipping stuff was

807
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,399
a nightmare during going right so we

808
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,960
didn't have that option either right so

809
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,020
I think is it possible yes uh but you

810
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,279
really need to do the trade-off between

811
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,279
the effort versus the platform fee right

812
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,440
yeah

813
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,260
yeah okay we do have three uh the LA the

814
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,440
gentleman second last row for here sorry

815
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,320
one last thing I would add is um startup

816
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,600
private you don't have to go public

817
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,460
right away I would highly recommend

818
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,980
going private until your company is

819
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,899
ready to go public and that can take

820
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,720
from two months to two years you know it

821
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,080
depends every company is different

822
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,020
yes the private means you only make it

823
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,899
invite only so you actually you know

824
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,640
work with different companies like

825
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,799
hacker one or book crowd and Bug bass

826
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,980
and then work with them to make it uh

827
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,140
invite only in terms of their top

828
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,840
researchers can only come and submit

829
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,539
and and I think uh representing a

830
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,460
platform I would also say that yes you

831
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,620
don't need there is no mandate to using

832
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,659
a platform if you are confident you have

833
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,700
the resources and you're able to do it

834
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,380
if you have the team enough to do it you

835
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,179
can do it on your own it's it's there is

836
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,919
no man the researchers are going to be

837
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,120
the same out there kind of so yeah 100

838
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,399
yeah

839
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,200
so I have a question around the budget

840
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,500
of what uh Bounty program like what if

841
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,919
uh many good bugs are reported within a

842
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,220
certain period of time and uh there

843
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,960
might be budget constraints so how do

844
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,720
you think about it as program managers

845
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,779
that's a good question yeah who wants to

846
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,600
take it no one

847
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,799
wants to talk about money right

848
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559
she doesn't have the problem no I mean

849
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,600
it's a really good question I think um

850
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,820
look it's it's the same question you

851
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,779
have with anything where you're

852
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,460
consuming stuff right so it's it's a

853
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,840
consumption thing if you run out of

854
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,600
budget you need to have I mean if you

855
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,100
can calculate your burn rate and make

856
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,480
sure you know on an average you're

857
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,059
giving out X dollars worth of bounty and

858
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,220
you have like Forex remaining in your

859
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,720
balance then that's where you start your

860
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,980
conversation with your Finance team

861
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,360
right like that's kind of the way to do

862
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,039
it and if you really are kind of blowing

863
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,539
down I mean and then you've got to see

864
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,620
why this is happening in the first place

865
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,000
right maybe your Bounty amounts are too

866
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,919
high maybe you haven't actually done

867
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,360
security assessments on your program

868
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,480
yeah in by the way uh cost per bug bug

869
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,220
bond is a pretty expensive yeah right I

870
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,200
mean your internal team or SAS tool

871
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,059
finding a bug is a lot cheaper than

872
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,159
being a researcher to do it so you I

873
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,419
think in the larger question there is

874
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,740
why did this happen that's one and

875
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,419
second is avoid surprises like just make

876
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,679
sure that you have enough in your pool

877
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,360
for the next few months before you have

878
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,220
that conversation right and and I think

879
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,260
that's the that's the short answer yeah

880
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,960
but in reality yeah you're like but

881
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,340
that's true of everything right like I

882
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,600
mean when you're running he can tell you

883
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,580
more he runs a company right going over

884
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,799
budget is is a common thing and most

885
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,840
seasoned managers know how to kind of

886
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,059
figure it out in general yeah yeah I

887
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,980
think it's a consumption thing and you

888
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,320
have to balance it based on your need

889
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,000
and budget and that's it yeah

890
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,350
oh I think

891
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,740
[Music]

892
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,260
hi yeah so

893
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,320
um have you ever faced a situation where

894
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,419
uh running a bug Bounty program ended up

895
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,299
breaking the environment or maybe uh

896
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,640
losing some sensitive uh data in the

897
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,340
hand of the researchers so if I mean how

898
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,260
do you deal with the situations and if

899
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,640
we take a step back then in the first

900
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,919
place how to take precautions to avoid

901
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,960
those situations

902
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,240
uh I can go next yeah I mean Google is

903
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,980
very very secure in terms of who have

904
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,679
access so to answer your question we

905
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,240
have not been into a situation where

906
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,940
people can get in or lose stuff

907
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,340
I will answer it differently when people

908
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,179
report a bug that can make this kind of

909
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,179
stuff happen it's definitely a critical

910
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,120
kind of severity issue so all of our

911
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,880
teams just jump on it and that's the P1

912
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,220
of that particular day that's how we

913
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,039
resolve it or what not so

914
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,440
access management is I guess every

915
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,860
company's biggest challenge and in terms

916
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,580
of

917
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,220
if someone is reporting it in in that

918
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,480
sense like you mentioned then again

919
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,860
that's the first thing you do that

920
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,960
particular day and then definitely

921
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,720
reward the researcher the amount he you

922
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,159
know basically deserves

923
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,080
yes

924
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,119
I mean I think I'll probably I'll

925
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,800
generalize the response by saying that

926
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,179
unexpected things happen and you have to

927
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,619
be ready for it it may not be like

928
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,599
access to sensitive data uh like I said

929
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,399
we have a talk coming up over exactly

930
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,960
that but we saw a lot more traffic than

931
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,280
we expected and we had to deal with it

932
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,899
in an automated manner right so yeah so

933
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,399
unexpected things happen and you have to

934
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,379
be ready for it uh but yeah I I haven't

935
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,239
dealt with that particular scenario that

936
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,099
you mentioned yeah I would like to add

937
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,960
that in many many cases usually the

938
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,940
researchers know where to stop as well

939
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,179
so is uh you can find a sensitive

940
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,219
information and you have the opportunity

941
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,739
to exploit that and try to get the data

942
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,659
whatever or just inform the companies

943
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,899
about Samsung species I do recommend to

944
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,940
do that because a lot of companies are

945
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,520
taking uh well that very seriously and

946
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,320
they don't want the researchers to dig

947
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,599
in on the information or whatever so

948
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,200
India is General a recommendation so

949
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,300
yeah

950
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
sir dude

951
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,760
do you take any precautions to avoid

952
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,560
those situations yeah of course that's

953
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,900
part of our job so cyber security we

954
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,820
need to protect our companies that's uh

955
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,820
that uh you never know the results of

956
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,859
our presence you need sir the usual

957
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,950
associ operations yeah

958
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,700
[Music]

959
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,859
question is somehow being resonated and

960
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,720
a half of it has been answered but I

961
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,640
would just like to understand how the

962
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,859
organization if we are having a specific

963
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:39,720
dedicated bug Bounty program for an

964
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,540
organization how we can ensure that the

965
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,339
data leakage is not happening and we

966
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,200
have a proper data privacy in line with

967
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,260
the bug Bounty program uh as uh already

968
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,820
discussed in the panel we have had

969
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,820
discussions about risk assessment uh the

970
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,980
risk categorization and the bug going to

971
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,740
program so how data privacy specifically

972
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,320
gdpr align with the bug Bounty program

973
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,260
and and how are the measures like again

974
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,079
answered but to an extent how are they

975
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,260
taken care as a part of risk assessment

976
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,119
which the dedicated bug Bounty program

977
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,880
in a security organization thank you

978
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,920
yeah I can talk in uh yeah what we are

979
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,680
doing uh and when we started uh working

980
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,540
on this uh one of the first things that

981
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,300
we made was contact with the legal team

982
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,060
and the Privacy team to make sure that

983
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,540
uh we had in a writing way uh all the

984
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,180
things that the researcher has not or

985
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,700
are is not able to to do right uh

986
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,920
regarding the gdpr and all that is a

987
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,619
part of the slas that we have in this

988
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,099
case uh or you know own site but also

989
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,099
with the hacker one and in the case that

990
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,160
uh someone uh bypasses that and that's

991
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,320
something that it's uh not expected or

992
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,960
should not do then the legal team will

993
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,420
uh start working on that

994
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,240
and just to add to that right if if the

995
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,400
whole premise of a bug Bounty program or

996
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,900
to an extent the pen testing program is

997
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,300
that if your bug Bounty Hunter doesn't

998
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,680
do that or you stop them from doing it

999
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,119
the hackers will so you'll have to deal

1000
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,680
with it anyway right so the question is

1001
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,760
do you want to do a little bit in a

1002
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,560
controlled manner with bug Bounty

1003
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,940
programs and Security Programs or do you

1004
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,020
want to deal with it or an incident

1005
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,820
happens so in a way I would say this

1006
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,880
prepares you for that eventuality as

1007
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,980
well right so yeah so however you would

1008
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,599
treat your uh you know Incident

1009
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,579
Management program it's a light lighter

1010
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:27,960
version of it without the impact so

1011
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,160
you'll have to kind of like deal with it

1012
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,619
that way yeah

1013
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,839
okay

1014
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:36,300
oh yeah hi so uh you know like during

1015
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,339
the covet time uh there were many

1016
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,859
Financial constraints and uh even for

1017
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,540
the security researchers they started

1018
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,460
doing backbone TV aggressively during

1019
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,920
the covet time I'm pretty sure the

1020
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,599
reports on the traffic will be really

1021
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,440
extreme uh what kind of problems did the

1022
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,619
program managers faced during the covet

1023
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,780
time or still just being faced probably

1024
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,460
well in in our case we didn't saw an

1025
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,859
increase on the number of reports or so

1026
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,680
but uh we we had that uh average number

1027
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
for a long time

1028
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,020
and we didn't suffer any issue or uh

1029
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,380
complication uh regarding that also

1030
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,200
I think on RN we we definitely see a

1031
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,839
spike also we not just covered we always

1032
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,359
see Spike during holiday season where

1033
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,180
it's like most of the researchers have

1034
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,980
double jobs right they'd love to do

1035
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,140
whatever job they do and then this they

1036
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,020
do for fashion every time we see a spike

1037
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,420
uh there is a direct impact to our

1038
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,640
vulnerability management team our

1039
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
internal feature remediation team and

1040
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,740
then that's what a program manager would

1041
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,920
consider if you see a spike how will you

1042
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,660
change the number of people who are

1043
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,180
working on those bugs right because at

1044
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,160
end of the day you don't want

1045
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,619
researchers to be left hanging like

1046
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,560
nobody's responding right

1047
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,020
um overall recommendation if you see

1048
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,040
some spike like that it's always uh like

1049
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,320
I said right transparency you you can

1050
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,359
you have a choice to go on the website

1051
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,640
and mention it that we are seeing a

1052
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,760
spike because of XYZ you are our

1053
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,920
response will be delayed by XM number of

1054
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,099
days or whatever so that's really

1055
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,320
helpful so researchers know that people

1056
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
are looking but it's going to take some

1057
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
time to respond back did I answer your

1058
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,920
question any anything follow up

1059
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,440
I'll pass one to others okay this is the

1060
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,900
last question we'll take we are short of

1061
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,339
time so three minutes left the last

1062
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,820
question thanks thanks for that uh so uh

1063
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,720
how do the how does the leadership and

1064
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,940
you know uh the the I mean the

1065
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,560
governance committees and you know I

1066
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
mean the Enterprise risk committees that

1067
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,920
you would have you know leverage this

1068
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,599
particular program to kind of you know

1069
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,300
decide on on the overall strategy and

1070
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,980
the you know how how is it kind of

1071
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,240
meeting the business objectives

1072
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,640
particularly because at one point in

1073
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,020
time they are kind of you know blessing

1074
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,880
the program right by funding it but then

1075
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,099
in the long term how do they see value

1076
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,720
in it you know what are the kind of

1077
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,980
things that they kind of you know that

1078
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,660
they look look out for and you know what

1079
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,920
kind of questions come to you guys

1080
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,060
particularly

1081
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,940
I'll take a quick answer before I pass

1082
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,640
on to others so um Google of course big

1083
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,800
organization and I only manage a small

1084
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,579
program which is Android vrp and then if

1085
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,220
you see Google has multiple products and

1086
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,280
every product has their own vrp the the

1087
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,940
reason for that is because we see value

1088
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,400
if I am doing it and I I recommend

1089
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,980
another sister team in the company to do

1090
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,599
it they will ask me the same question

1091
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,480
right what was the benefit or what did

1092
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,040
you learn

1093
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,579
um as Android or Android chipset vrp we

1094
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,859
definitely get a lot of critical bugs

1095
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,200
which we might not have found any other

1096
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
way and that's the kind of report we

1097
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,119
present to the management showing them

1098
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,579
we couldn't have get this before if we

1099
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,180
don't have a vrp program so I guess we

1100
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,460
are fairly a larger organization and we

1101
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,200
see a lot of value but I definitely

1102
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,300
would pass on to these guys like you

1103
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,900
know if if they see those challenges

1104
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,060
at the end when you have a backpack the

1105
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,500
program or responsible discussion

1106
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,720
program you are you have your assets

1107
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,180
exposed and the information that uh or

1108
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,560
the reports that you will get from the

1109
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,900
researchers is the same that hackers bad

1110
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,820
guys sorry not the using hackers but

1111
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,880
guys it could use even to exploit uh

1112
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,579
your company so in our case we had the

1113
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,440
fully support from uh from the company

1114
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,339
uh they understood quite uh natural way

1115
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,680
and a common sense and I say before we

1116
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
are super we are part of the community

1117
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,020
so we got the support and it was super

1118
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,040
easy I cannot complain about that

1119
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,260
yeah yeah so so I think um you know as

1120
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,119
someone who manages security

1121
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:54,900
um

1122
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,000
generally defining Roi for security is

1123
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,339
hard right in general it's hard

1124
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,440
boundaries is among the easiest because

1125
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,420
you only pay when you find a bug right

1126
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,160
so the idea is that like hey why do you

1127
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,900
just spend whatever X number of dollars

1128
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,180
because we found X by five bucks right

1129
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,440
and if you don't find bugs you don't pay

1130
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,720
the money right so I think I I think the

1131
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,579
ROI discussion is actually extremely

1132
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,460
simple in bug bounties not so much when

1133
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,020
you want to buy like a big Enterprise

1134
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,940
tool to scan your code and things like

1135
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,380
that there it's a lot harder to convince

1136
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,480
people so I would say that is probably

1137
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,240
not a you know a big concern uh the

1138
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,800
bigger concern is like communication and

1139
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,000
how do you handle that and all that but

1140
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,440
Roi is fairly straightforward here

1141
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,520
because you pay for what you get that's

1142
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,720
it

1143
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,240
all right thank you so much everyone and

1144
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,220
those who still have questions and we've

1145
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,619
not even able to take it will be around

1146
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,380
so outside you can catch us and and any

1147
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,300
of the panelists and feel free to ask

1148
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,240
things that you still want answered with

1149
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,280
