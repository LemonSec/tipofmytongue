tell welcome

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,320
to the panel and thank you for joining

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,020
me uh in this discussion uh myself of

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,780
course as I've already got introduced uh

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,939
I also come from community and we are

23
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,119
going to talk about two main aspects

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
today one which is cyber threat

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
intelligence I know it sounds very cool

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,200
we will going to go deep dive and try to

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,880
open up and see how does it look in

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,119
reality and also the parallel which goes

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,880
with CTI cyber threat intelligence what

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
we call is collaboration and the trust

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,280
aspect of it right and

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,520
start with I'll just uh kick off with

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,040
the CTI introduction and then I'll open

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,600
the floor for some questions

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,619
so just to give you an idea on the Cyber

36
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,140
threat intelligence side we all know uh

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,380
for a Layman person right uh threat

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,079
Intel Is Not A New Concept in today's

39
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,200
world it exists since our war days as

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,140
well right we used to have spy right

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,600
today also in military we also apply the

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,399
threat intelligence concept

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,920
the same concept is getting transported

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
to the cyberspace and that is where we

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
are calling cyber threat intelligence so

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,780
in a simple language if you want to

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,180
understand uh let's say I'm taking one

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,860
example you have an Intel agencies at

49
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,080
the country level who are keeping an eye

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,580
on external threats to the country

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,319
internal threats to the country and they

52
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,300
keep curating an Intel and they keep

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,099
passing on the actionable intelligence

54
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,840
to the right agencies sometimes it's an

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,120
Lea sometimes a military and they act

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,580
upon it same happens in the cyberspace

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,340
and that's where the CTI is kicking off

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,640
as one of the tool and moving on that

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,220
direction first question towards the

60
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,900
panel uh is again I'll open this to all

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,459
three of you this question and feel free

62
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,739
to ask from your perspective because you

63
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,780
all three bring different experience to

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,580
the table so

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,580
how do you perceive CTI as a tool in

66
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,680
your kitty when you are defining uh the

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,300
strategy to counter the Next Generation

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,060
threads which are out there which is

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,220
well known or which may come down the

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,340
line

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,340
so um

72
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,980
the context of threat intelligence play

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,400
uh significantly important role for any

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,140
corporate today

75
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,739
so when we started building say a

76
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,599
difference in depth or a cyber security

77
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,220
strategy it always began with uh say

78
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,860
preferably protect uh where your

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,080
protection breaches at least have the

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,640
strategy to detect

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,980
and in the event something were to

82
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,260
happen have the ability to respond back

83
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,780
now if you look at all of these three

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,299
these were all completely reactive in

85
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,940
nature all right so you see an event

86
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,860
that is happening you have to have the

87
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,500
ability to respond and react back

88
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,959
the predictability part is something

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,200
that has been missing in the entire

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,480
corporate cyber security strategy the

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
ability for a corporate to pre-indue an

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,819
attack that is coming our way uh was

93
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,860
something that was a comprehensive

94
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,140
missing pillar in the overall cyber

95
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,720
security strategy which is where uh the

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,019
predictable part of the Cyber uh came in

97
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,840
picture and corporate started feeling

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,620
the need to see how will I predict an

99
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,779
attack even before it has happened to me

100
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,040
right so obviously the virtue of

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,340
intelligence uh came in per view and

102
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,639
what can and who can be the providers to

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,600
such intelligence how do I uh deeply

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,300
engrave such intelligence that is coming

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,479
to me into redefining my protect detect

106
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,240
and response strategy uh became the

107
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,880
cursor and that is where I think the

108
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,040
industry development around threat Intel

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,160
and the importance of retinol to us yeah

110
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,040
uh you want to add your perspective sure

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,080
yeah so you know for me threat

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,479
intelligence as you said is a very wide

113
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,020
topic right we as humans have inherently

114
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,820
learned about how to in the physical

115
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,340
world think about risk and security I

116
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,860
have a three-year-old you know and I see

117
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,740
her uh you know once she falls down the

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,660
next time she knows not to go there not

119
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,759
only does she does that for herself but

120
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,500
she has a younger cousin who's two years

121
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,780
old and the first time she did that she

122
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,639
went and thought younger cousin don't

123
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,500
trip over that place right like she held

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,900
him and walked him around so to me you

125
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,960
know in the Physical Realm our old brain

126
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,240
has just learned to do this day in Day

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Out

128
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,139
cyber world is relatively new right it's

129
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,419
what 60 years old and we're still trying

130
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,919
to figure out how to

131
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,139
communicate this information how to

132
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,660
translate it how to make use of it so

133
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,000
that's how I simplify it in my head uh

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,320
you know Martin gave a really good

135
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,060
example of the the technical

136
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,680
intelligence that they're using but

137
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,139
there's also a very strategic element of

138
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,940
cyber threat that we have to think about

139
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,940
so I came from uh the semiconductor

140
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,639
world my previous company uh was a

141
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,699
Semiconductor Company and if you know

142
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,560
semiconductor has been in the crosshairs

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,000
of nation state attacks right there's

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,860
been a war going on for a very long time

145
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,880
about

146
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,460
uh how do we manufacture semiconductors

147
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,180
the the chips the designs and so on so

148
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,160
for us a huge component of as we were

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,319
defining our overall security strategy

150
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,080
was even where do we manufacture these

151
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,759
chips right we had Manufacturing in

152
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,280
certain locations but because of the

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
types of security threats we saw from

154
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,940
coming from certain areas we said nope

155
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,620
we're not going to manufacture there and

156
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,660
so on and so forth so you have different

157
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,639
elements of threat intelligence you know

158
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,080
as we kind of think about our overall

159
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
cyber security program that we have to

160
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,139
take into account

161
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,380
uh I hear you know Buddha perspective uh

162
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,280
from the large Enterprises perspective I

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,319
am would you like to take a shot you

164
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
know from a fast moving agile uh startup

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,479
perspective how do you take CPI as a

166
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,740
tool in your strategy

167
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,380
since startup the security is uh way

168
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,180
different right

169
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,600
so uh you know CTI we use it as a

170
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
proactive automation but you know it's

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
it's it's part of a smaller strategy

172
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,039
right uh we can start from the objective

173
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,199
of if something happens we should know

174
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,860
right from there you you start and then

175
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,319
that is how you build your security most

176
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,120
of these startups don't have the

177
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,699
security awareness so that is why we see

178
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,860
a lot of breaches happening and CTI is

179
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,300
one of those two who can basically you

180
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,620
know tell you if something has already

181
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,380
happened which can be uh you know first

182
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,660
tone of building that security culture

183
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,880
and the awareness so that's how I look

184
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,580
at it the ectiser thanks uh just to

185
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,560
summarize uh you know the responses from

186
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,660
all I think as a strategic tool like we

187
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,120
all knew uh let's say nist framework

188
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,099
right people who are doing the Cyber

189
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,020
risk management we realize that how we

190
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,539
evolved uh you know from prevent protect

191
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,660
to detect to respond obviously we missed

192
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,039
somewhere the identify bucket but still

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,500
part of the strategy but how the base

194
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,780
pillar of predict is coming out right

195
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,900
and that's where CTI plays itself into

196
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,780
the predict bucket but that's not a

197
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,340
bucket which will put into the left side

198
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,020
of the framework or the right side of

199
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,660
the framework that's like across because

200
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,699
when you receive a threat intelligence

201
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,160
right you need to give it to your

202
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
preventive Technologies like firewall

203
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,879
needs and intelligence right your IPS

204
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,560
leads in intelligence your proxy needs

205
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,479
and intelligence at the same time your

206
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,520
detection Technologies like your sim

207
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,679
ueba and bad machine learning driven

208
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,200
detection any type of detection also

209
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,580
needs an eyes and ear from a

210
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,679
threatenable perspective also the last

211
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,180
pillar response right when you are

212
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,519
responding doing a digital forensics you

213
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,980
also need to have thread Intel in your

214
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,540
hand and that's how I think I'll

215
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,399
summarize overall discussion that how it

216
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,500
fits into the Strategic bucket and it's

217
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,380
an enabler for all the pillars now

218
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,920
moving uh you know deep inside the CTI

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,640
space right uh today it's a

220
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,100
known understanding that CBI equals to

221
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,880
ioc right and I'm sure we all have seen

222
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,459
the industry evolving uh you know uh

223
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,560
from the days that uh there was list of

224
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,839
one IEP which is bad and one URL which

225
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,600
is bad one hash which is bad uh the

226
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,580
volume I still remember my soft days

227
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,760
were like 10 IPS 100 IPS per day we

228
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,339
ended up blocking and today we talk

229
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,560
about like million IPS per day uh

230
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,839
something two million indicators per day

231
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
how do you see industry you know uh

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,940
moving in this direction and how you see

233
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,459
the overall indicator of compromise

234
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,240
being perceived uh as a tool within the

235
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,959
CTI anybody wants to take a shot

236
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,859
my apologies

237
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,480
so coming from both the experience say

238
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
as a Telco provider today and in my

239
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,959
previous student uh with say a quasi

240
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
regulator like in PCI the biggest

241
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,120
struggle that we used to face is uh

242
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,880
whenever such threat Intel feed comes

243
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,880
stating that block a complete uh Network

244
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,200
block

245
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,040
yeah and the block would be as simple as

246
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,720
block China as a region I'm just stating

247
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
a country not offensive to any other uh

248
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
State here but then block a complete

249
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,820
territory as a whole uh say for a bank

250
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,839
typically you would have your roaming

251
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,380
user still operating from uh

252
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,420
geography where say the nation state may

253
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,940
decide to block the complete geography

254
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,420
as a whole right so uh the block from a

255
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,100
CTI the context is far more critical for

256
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,380
some such actions that were to be taken

257
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,959
so from the days that we operated the

258
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,600
S12 to now it is like not tens and

259
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
twenties of ips it is a country's pool

260
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,600
uh the complete uh corporate pool

261
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,120
getting into The Blacklist Etc is coming

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,200
our way so the era is moved from

263
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,980
Standalone looking at iocs so the area

264
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,899
that we contemplate now is no matter

265
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,360
where the intelligence come from how

266
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
does it impact my business today and

267
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,180
what do I isolate that away from the

268
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,740
crystal clear Blacklist that is coming

269
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,320
to me and not to impact my business Etc

270
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,779
and then move forward is a is a position

271
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,540
that we rattled today with kashya yeah

272
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,680
um well any startups I think you know

273
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,660
the major thing is you know move like

274
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,220
there are no blocking States right we

275
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,680
are we we operate from small offices we

276
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,320
born in clouds right so having Gateway

277
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,700
little products or you know blocking

278
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,000
cavities is going away uh I I think in

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
in like the hashes and the things right

280
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,300
what you mentioned we need some

281
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,680
protection on endpoints which can

282
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,779
basically you know move away from these

283
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,660
hashitation things and the probably you

284
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,399
know detect behavioral patterns or

285
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,019
increase the endpoints protection so

286
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,399
that even if there are certain things

287
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,680
you know it get protected at the end

288
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,820
point level

289
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,459
you know to me you you described it

290
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,579
really well right the Holy Grail of uh

291
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,920
dealing with the complexity of the size

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,899
that at least in the Telco world and I'm

293
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,880
new to Telecom I'm still kind of

294
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,620
learning the environment but where you

295
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,519
have

296
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,420
uh you know 60 000 servers and you know

297
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,019
you have 120 data centers the the amount

298
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,820
of complexity that the teams have to

299
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,019
deal with is too enormous right so to me

300
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,180
really the goal is as you describe

301
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,980
everyone needs that information all

302
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,480
tools and Technologies need that

303
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,180
information can you truly build a policy

304
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,519
engine at the end of the day which can

305
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,639
absorb intelligence from any Source

306
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,680
right be it a text file a CSV or any

307
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
other sticks or whatever

308
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,260
uh and then really uh discern whether

309
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,720
it's good intelligence or not is it

310
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,880
trustworthy or not right because I know

311
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,040
there have been cases Even in our

312
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,620
company in Airtel where we've blocked

313
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,540
certain IPS that were coming from very

314
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,820
trustworthy sources and it had major

315
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,200
customer impact

316
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,579
uh

317
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,139
you know so you really have to kind of

318
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,000
discern whether it's

319
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,399
trustworthy inter even if it is

320
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,779
trustworthy is it something we should

321
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,000
action on or not and then being able to

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,279
communicate to these hundreds of or even

323
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,500
in our case thousands of devices all at

324
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,639
the same time

325
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,560
I I think that'll be the Holy Grail we

326
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
are not there yet I'm hoping you know

327
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,740
the Cyber and other companies are

328
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,600
investing in it and we'll get there but

329
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,579
that's what I want to see I can't

330
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,620
disagree with that you know because I

331
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,940
still recollect when you know this

332
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,579
incident popped up uh one of the time

333
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,220
right in the sock we uh got an Intel

334
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,720
saying that hey there's a list of ips

335
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,820
which are like bad posting some bad

336
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,680
activities and we ended up blocking on

337
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,440
the firewall gone fast forward six

338
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,200
months eight months uh we got reached

339
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,660
out by business unit saying that hey uh

340
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,519
some of my operating systems are not

341
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,620
taking in some update right and where we

342
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,779
investigated okay just because some IPS

343
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,779
are getting blocked so six months before

344
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,720
the same IPS were hosting a bad malware

345
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,139
campaign got cleaned up and got acquired

346
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,639
by one of the operating system providers

347
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,100
started hosting the uh their operating

348
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,380
system updates on top of it

349
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,300
and you have the another problem to

350
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,000
solve right so exactly the point coming

351
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
out of here uh is it the important

352
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,019
aspect is Intel comes with an expiry

353
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,079
uh if you see in physical world also

354
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
right there is let's say uh Intel agency

355
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,500
identifies as a bomb threat at 9 00 am

356
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,920
in Goa right at Sunday that will expires

357
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,560
after Sunday 9 A.M maybe if the

358
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,180
attackers are not good they might delay

359
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,339
by one hour or two but at some point it

360
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,220
will expire right it has to expire so

361
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,260
it's a characteristics of an

362
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,660
intelligence it has to be action on a

363
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,000
timely manner and it will expire and

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
that's what we see on our day-to-day

365
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,019
operational challenges uh while dealing

366
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,060
with the Intel but one uh good point you

367
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,500
know run what up

368
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,399
is the trust right that's a very

369
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,459
important word when we talk about cyber

370
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,740
threat intelligence right what do we

371
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,019
trust what not do we trust right and

372
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,660
that is where uh the second aspect which

373
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,699
I want to uh you know have your view

374
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,360
also were on on this is uh how do you

375
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,500
see a

376
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,839
we always see the bad guys on the other

377
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,279
side of the table are collaborating with

378
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,320
each other right they are like uh

379
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,779
crafting a malware sample or defining a

380
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,139
new CNC way to uh communicate right so

381
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,940
much collaboration happening on that

382
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,100
side of the table but we don't see much

383
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,079
happening on Defender side of the table

384
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,839
right so how do you see building that

385
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,000
trust within the community and moving

386
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,980
towards the collaboration in CTI space

387
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,579
has a longer way

388
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,579
foreign

389
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:00,899
Trust on the defender side right this

390
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,820
this is a perfect example of how we

391
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,440
build trust look at the the community

392
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,899
here is just amazing to watch so many

393
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,820
people come together you know we're

394
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,920
doing a live bug Bounty program right

395
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,560
now uh with one of our applications it's

396
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,300
just the amount of collaboration that

397
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,980
happens we just don't give enough credit

398
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,079
to it what I will

399
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,040
say is there isn't enough

400
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,699
um

401
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,800
reason to collaborate within the

402
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,240
corporate world purely at the

403
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,220
corporation level right and I think

404
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,380
that's a challenge because of how cyber

405
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,139
threats get perceived once someone gets

406
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,720
attacked uh you know there's a lot of

407
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,339
impact on the brand there could be

408
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,079
competition I'm not saying someone

409
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,759
actively goes and impacts someone else

410
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,100
but when it happens it can almost

411
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,220
benefit your competition to a very large

412
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,040
extent right so the the incentives are

413
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,500
not exactly aligned just yet

414
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,660
but what we are seeing at least you know

415
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,220
Martin and I we were laughing earlier

416
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,600
that you know we spent half the time in

417
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,940
sanchat Bhavan in New Delhi every time

418
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,860
we meet uh that's where our meetings

419
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,559
happen the the government of India is

420
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,359
doing a great job whether it be the

421
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,799
certain you know there's a telecom

422
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,260
t-shirt which is being created you know

423
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,819
it's almost like an escrow that's being

424
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,819
formed which is acting as a great way to

425
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,760
ensure collaboration happens it may not

426
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,419
happen intuitively I mean uh today but I

427
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,559
think we're moving in the right

428
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
direction where it's almost being forced

429
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
and I think over time you know we'll get

430
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,380
better and better at how to share that

431
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,260
information in a in a trusted format

432
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,240
uh would you like to add something on

433
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,620
this because I think you have been

434
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,360
working on this uh you know in your

435
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,460
previous experiences on building these

436
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,559
communities and bringing people together

437
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,600
to collaborate on

438
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,520
so I think in India uh the essence is uh

439
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,280
the move has to get initiated from a top

440
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,520
down we are we are normally uh by

441
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,660
culture

442
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,700
we would prefer to be disciplined right

443
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,520
so uh than being Bond disciplined right

444
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,380
so somebody has to tell us this is the

445
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,179
right way to do this is the culturally

446
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,960
right so no offense uh but uh so from uh

447
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,539
from a state specific that is where the

448
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,000
first direction that began with uh we

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
had at least uh at least few years back

450
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,840
the setup for cert which originated and

451
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,380
thereby trustworthy communication

452
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,320
insert to disseminate information that

453
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,820
began then that had expanded into the

454
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,059
so-called Regulators as a community so

455
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,320
you would have

456
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
uh domestically here in India at least

457
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,940
we have a very strong regulator and name

458
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,700
of for financial institutes whether it

459
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,120
is sebi or Reserve Bank and in similar

460
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,179
line with say a DOT dry equivalent for a

461
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,280
telecom so you have structured regulated

462
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,640
well-regulated industry uh so these

463
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,059
Regulators next line to the nodal agency

464
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,320
like in NCS or cert has already taken

465
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,900
the first level step to set up such

466
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,299
information dissemination so uh the

467
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,220
quotient is who to trust right who to

468
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,320
trust can we trust anybody everybody the

469
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,200
answer is uh in today's context in

470
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,059
security we are already talking about

471
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,880
zero trust not to trust right so uh when

472
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,460
to trust and who to trust at least a

473
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,559
nodal there is a nodal standpoint who

474
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,160
can be trusted so there are two two

475
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
different uh experiences that I have

476
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,900
shared at least nodal agencies in the

477
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,419
banking Industries have started sharing

478
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,580
this

479
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,799
Intel information as comprehensive

480
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,620
exchanges amongst themselves and I am

481
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,320
sure when Financial institutes have set

482
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
up it is pure play to do with the

483
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,580
relevance of what is happening in

484
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,860
financial institute that goes to the

485
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,660
saying in the current context that we

486
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,000
deal with most of the companies have

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,740
removed away the verticalization

488
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,039
standpoint so if you look at uh who is a

489
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,900
finance company today almost every

490
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,419
company who wants to do has a digital

491
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,880
alarm would want to do a funding based a

492
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,740
business is a finance company today so

493
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,280
the thinning of verticalization will

494
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,380
have to expand the footprint for our

495
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,380
nodal agencies also to disseminate

496
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,200
information to a wider audience group

497
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,419
that should come our way I think India

498
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,179
is still a long shot away for that but

499
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,799
there are necessary first steps that

500
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,539
have been taken in my previous

501
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,100
experience we set it up for say the firm

502
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,080
that I work dissemination of information

503
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,679
to 1100 member banks 1100 Banks across

504
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,179
country here has the ability to

505
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,840
subscribe to uh such uh disseminated

506
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,600
threat Intel information and so on will

507
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,299
typically land up happening as industry

508
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,480
peers starts forming such uh information

509
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,320
dissemination

510
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,880
we heard you know the perspective from

511
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,340
more Telecom and Enterprise perspective

512
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,380
but when it comes to the startup uh we

513
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,780
always say that the culture is agile and

514
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,340
the culture of collaboration you know

515
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,460
within the company right but uh

516
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,380
what are the barriers that you see today

517
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,360
right when you let's say even if you

518
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,679
have an intern to do the collaboration

519
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,900
like one of the challenges that you face

520
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,140
today uh when you want to even if you

521
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,059
want to collaborate or

522
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,980
if you want to start your journey right

523
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,900
what are the problems or challenges that

524
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,360
you see or the solution that you foresee

525
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,340
together that we should do

526
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,260
I think it's the same with what mature

527
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,480
right the trustee is always going to be

528
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,400
a challenge I mean you know sharing the

529
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
news like we see we still see you know

530
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,080
if somebody get hacked right or breached

531
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,539
uh we still see from a different point

532
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,400
of view I think that need to be changed

533
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,220
so we need to establish trust amongst

534
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
the industries and for startup it would

535
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,659
be really helpful to you know come

536
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,640
together and discuss who is getting what

537
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,159
right so that you know other peers can

538
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,559
benefit and learn from them right most

539
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,360
of these uh you know breaches happens

540
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,640
with Cloud right that is why now there

541
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,860
is more focus on cloud security so

542
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,480
people can share their learnings what

543
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,039
went wrong and so that you know others

544
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,380
can basically learn from it and before

545
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,240
their turn they can you know fix things

546
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,919
you learn I think that is the need of

547
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,440
the time uh somebody need to you know

548
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,320
build those forearm get those leaders in

549
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,140
together and I think in startup I think

550
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,880
startup industry specific leaders would

551
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,980
make more sense because their world is

552
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,260
different than the corporates

553
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,500
so yeah that's nice thanks uh I think uh

554
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,059
just to summarize you know the

555
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,559
discussions that we heard here I think

556
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,860
on the sharing and collaboration uh one

557
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,280
thing that strike my mind is obviously

558
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,480
why the sharing or collaboration

559
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,419
somewhere the pillar is the context and

560
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,460
the relevancy of the Intel that comes to

561
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,000
my mind right that uh

562
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,860
contextual information and the relevancy

563
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,559
is most important as a receiving party

564
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,140
let's say if I am a Goa police right and

565
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,940
if I receive a bomb threat for Mumbai

566
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,280
that's not relevant For Me Maybe that's

567
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,720
more relevant for the Mumbai police

568
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,179
right so yes there is a flood of

569
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,760
information with all of us but what is

570
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,640
relevant to me what is contextual to me

571
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,039
that's more important that's where this

572
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,020
sharing and the collaboration will also

573
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,140
bring that relevancy into the picture uh

574
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,940
think like a big picture if you have an

575
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,860
industry specific collaboration let's

576
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,360
say you have an Isaacs right Financial

577
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,820
Services Isaac space Isaac Aviation

578
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,980
Isaac those are like industry specific

579
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,500
Isaac which exist they have the members

580
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,480
to share and Intel with each other right

581
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,480
at the same time there are geography

582
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,059
specific uh Intel sharing agencies as

583
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,700
well as as you know Martin said that at

584
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,460
more regulatory level industry level and

585
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,380
geography level also there are efforts

586
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,200
which are being put in but how and when

587
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,299
you go and party participate into those

588
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,059
communities to get more relevancy to

589
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,320
yourself right

590
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,900
so that's very important again

591
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,000
characteristics of threat intelligence

592
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,860
when I was just noting down that it has

593
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,840
to be timely it has to be actionable it

594
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,240
will expire it has to be contextual it

595
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,240
has to be relevant that's we see all of

596
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,740
these are the characteristics of

597
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,799
intelligence site and we touched upon

598
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,020
one of the aspect of

599
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,400
moving towards you know more behavioral

600
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,720
uh more behavioral intelligence right so

601
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,240
anybody wants to take a shot on you know

602
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,000
how you see the industry moving uh from

603
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
just more technical Intel which is like

604
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
iocs IP domain URL has two more

605
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,760
behavioral Intel right why you see that

606
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,700
is important to look just beyond just

607
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,500
indicator and why we should go towards

608
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,440
behavior and if you have any idea to

609
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,700
share on that aspect anybody

610
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,400
sure I I can go look uh as you said

611
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,740
right intelligence when it comes at the

612
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,600
Tactical level from an indicator of

613
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,900
compromise expires very quickly uh most

614
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,640
of the threats that we see again if you

615
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,260
have a nation-state attack or an

616
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,539
advanced persistent threat then I would

617
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,500
I would

618
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,360
table that for a second right because

619
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,100
there's an immense amount of money

620
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,679
there's very different motivations for

621
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,059
people you know when you have a

622
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,740
nation-state attack that they can change

623
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,539
their tactics what they are trying to do

624
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,880
very very quickly and have you know

625
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,380
immense amount of funding to be able to

626
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,400
do that

627
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,360
but a lot of the uh threats that occur

628
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,299
which are more financially motivated the

629
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,580
the tactic the the tactics that the

630
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,200
threat actors use they don't change that

631
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
right they might start with the phishing

632
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,880
then they do credential attacks you know

633
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,799
credential stuffing so on and so forth

634
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,900
how they do it what indicators of

635
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,880
compromise they use may change but their

636
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,799
overall tactics will not necessarily

637
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,080
change right that's why understanding

638
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,419
the behavior

639
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,919
tracking uh you know a lot of these

640
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,500
campaigns become extremely important uh

641
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,279
those things take time and actually you

642
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,020
know

643
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,940
if you can really understand them and

644
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,380
have the resources to be able to

645
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,840
understand them can really pay off in a

646
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,840
in a big way for the corporates not just

647
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,640
corporates for everyone I I should be

648
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,510
careful as I use that one yeah

649
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,159
[Music]

650
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,039
so one of the uh aspect that comes to my

651
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,000
mind today is uh

652
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,179
the trend shift that has happened uh in

653
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,860
security is

654
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,440
there is a lot of gray right the the

655
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,419
decision between a zero and one is

656
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,700
relatively easy to make but then there

657
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,220
is way too much of gray area so if you

658
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,220
look at the technology Spectrum across

659
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,159
security forget about uh CTI Standalone

660
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,740
in picture uh in each of these

661
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,500
technologies that are there operated in

662
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,960
the security domain has drifted away

663
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,799
from the 0 1 2 helping as decide in the

664
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,900
gray area the active decision making

665
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,960
that has happened right so uh the the

666
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,620
analytical part at least over the past

667
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,559
uh five plus years we have seen a lot of

668
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,720
work happening in the analytics side of

669
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,600
uh almost all the technology uh

670
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,940
predictive Behavior whether it is to say

671
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,940
user analytics Network analytics or for

672
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,919
even that security events that are

673
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,260
happening has drifted away from the zero

674
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,159
one two uh giving a predictive uh

675
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,860
Behavior which can give even in risk for

676
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,380
that matter in fraud risk as well people

677
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,539
today don't look at a zero one decision

678
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,640
it is a qualitative analysis that gives

679
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,360
there is a 80 probability that the

680
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,640
transaction could be a fraudulent there

681
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,799
is nobody who's determining yes it is

682
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,320
truly a fraudulent also so the analytics

683
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,260
has uh deeply engraved into active

684
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,260
decision making and so is what as a

685
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,659
natural progression I would believe even

686
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,600
in the CTA perspective as it was earlier

687
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,720
which began with the very Crystal Clear

688
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,840
ioc of Blacklist being completely deny

689
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,000
uh and it has become completely

690
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,980
unmanageable these days of cash it is

691
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,900
like to the tunes of if you look at

692
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,980
Perimeter uh firewalls of corporate they

693
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,080
would have at least million IPS today a

694
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,880
million will be still a smaller number

695
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,980
which are there and there exhaust the

696
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,320
ipv I'm here sometimes exactly right so

697
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
and nobody undo uh these eliminated

698
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
items so that should also move to

699
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,020
predictive uh and then in an analytical

700
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,900
manner is a natural progression as and

701
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,820
when it happens we are more than curious

702
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,980
to understand how industry takes it up

703
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,410
yeah

704
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,459
[Music]

705
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,539
so the thing is that nowadays you know

706
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,120
the uh resources are very cheap for

707
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
trade actors right we have Cloud we have

708
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,860
you know other stuff which make it more

709
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,559
you know resourceful for them what we

710
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,840
need as mentioned right we should move

711
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,940
away from the indicative you know

712
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,279
factors than the behavioral factors

713
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,380
where what is the motor of how the if

714
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,700
they are scanning what they are doing

715
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,220
right like these EDR Solutions look at

716
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,340
you know the behavior than the hash or

717
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,260
you know the other stuff which is not

718
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,700
fixed which is like you know Behavior

719
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,559
Analysis so I think that is that is

720
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,419
where you know it will be helpful I

721
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,399
think excellent points are brought out

722
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,260
together is just to summarize right I

723
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,440
think uh the classic example let's say

724
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,419
I'm sure many of you would have been

725
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,520
from Red Team perspective right you

726
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,380
might be crafting uh some of the malvers

727
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,539
yourself and testing your organization

728
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,640
uh you know capabilities from a defense

729
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,880
perspective uh yes as I'm all brought up

730
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,620
a point like resources these rape are

731
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,659
much cheaper right with the help of AWS

732
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,899
gcp spinning up a new URL or a domain

733
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:50,279
which will host my command and control

734
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,679
becomes a little bit easy so think from

735
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,360
an attacker perspective I crafted a

736
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,159
malware executing one of the technique

737
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,140
and let's say that malware has a hash

738
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,360
and that is communicating with one of

739
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,100
the domain or URL outside we call it

740
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,260
command and control right but just to

741
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,600
change changing that URL has become like

742
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,940
super easy changing the hash I go to the

743
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,860
code line some write some extra line

744
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,020
hash gets changed so if I want to attack

745
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,899
a organization which is B was a c I'll

746
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,700
keep changing this indicator very

747
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,120
frequently right so the best way to get

748
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,679
behind them is to understand the

749
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,419
behavior whenever you see such malware

750
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,299
or any threat attack happening we have

751
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,419
to go behind the behavior that what that

752
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,240
malware was trying to do right let's say

753
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,340
that malware was trying to do credential

754
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,860
dumping using Powershell so now you know

755
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,559
the exact TTP behind that malware

756
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,960
Behavior so even if as an attacker if I

757
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,200
change my iocs but if changing the TTP

758
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,960
is tough as an attacker I am sure there

759
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,120
are many techniques available but

760
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,740
crafting that malware spinning up

761
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,539
infrastructure and then moving on will

762
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,120
take some time it makes my life more

763
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,799
difficult as an attacker right and

764
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,140
that's where a Defender has to hit and

765
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,480
make sure that while talking about the

766
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,419
CTI we focus on ioc but we also focus on

767
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,480
uh behavioral aspect as well so just to

768
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,880
summarize overall discussion I know we

769
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,399
have five minutes uh I I want to have

770
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
the audience for questions uh but before

771
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,380
I go there I just want to summarize that

772
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,620
we completed the complete life cycle of

773
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,419
threat intelligence right have you

774
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,820
collect the Intel from diverse sources

775
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,399
then you analyze what is relevant to you

776
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,679
what is contextual to you you need to

777
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
prioritize because you might receive

778
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,360
tens of intelligence today what is

779
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,039
relevant for you you have to prioritize

780
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,500
in the queue then also put it to the

781
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,380
actioning right in the meantime the

782
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,000
connectioning has to be across your

783
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,919
prevention technology your detection

784
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,020
technology your response your risk

785
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,240
management your fraud management

786
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,740
everybody needs to consume the Intel

787
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,419
it's not just your stock who is going to

788
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,179
consume the Intel right so the complete

789
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,220
life cycle of threat intelligence has to

790
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,140
be taken care and I think we covered

791
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,299
discussion uh across the thread inter

792
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,100
life cycle so with that I would like to

793
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,140
open the floor for any question if you

794
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,820
have

795
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,550
we have one from here one from there

796
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,819
[Music]

797
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,220
look

798
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,980
I so it was a wonderful session by all

799
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,039
of you my question is you know we have

800
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,080
the new technologies threat until the

801
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,960
idea of fit Intel is to safeguard data

802
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,880
and infrastructure and of course have

803
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
the incident response despite that new

804
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,220
technologies Ai and metal analytics

805
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,860
whatever your space spoke about we still

806
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,679
see that the data breaches the Gap is

807
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,899
four to six months sometimes even to get

808
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:49,020
the data and even as part of our audits

809
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,840
what we see is in large organizations

810
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,640
although they may have 60 000 servers

811
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,799
hundred thousand servers many of those

812
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,100
work in silos and those threat intels

813
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,500
are not covered into critical

814
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,200
um you know Services even in smaller

815
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,179
organizations cloud-based organizations

816
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,039
we see that the threat Intel is

817
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,919
absolutely missing because on AWS they

818
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,419
have not subscribed to elastic services

819
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,480
and AWS or gcp gives limited visibility

820
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,720
per se and Cloud organizations or

821
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,340
smaller organizations don't some

822
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,320
sometimes have those budgets to go into

823
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,380
a paid Services Etc so we see that

824
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,419
there's still a lot of Gap in terms of

825
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,440
either silos or budgets or and you know

826
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,419
despite the entire technology being

827
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,100
available we don't see many companies

828
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,380
adopting those Technologies and making

829
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,100
this uh the GitHub which is or or the

830
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,640
Dos attacks or whatever is it is

831
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,919
to reduce those vulnerabilities or

832
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,519
reducer status

833
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,019
so what do you what is your suggestion

834
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,419
to the industry and the community as a

835
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,480
whole I think that's a complex and tough

836
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,940
question uh I'm sure anybody

837
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,559
let me just make sure I understand the

838
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,059
question the question was essentially

839
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,519
hey we keep buying more technology

840
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,260
but yet the number of breaches keep

841
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,219
going up

842
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,280
uh there's so much threat Intel but how

843
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,599
do you effectively operate it

844
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,940
uh what is the what is in store for the

845
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,699
industry to do to make I mean to reduce

846
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,339
a gap of data which is uh six from six

847
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,560
months to maybe two weeks or three weeks

848
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,940
with all the new technologies available

849
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,280
if you have that answer I'm gonna give

850
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,199
you a million dollars you know look that

851
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,699
I have the answer but I can give you

852
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,580
after the after the session look the

853
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,619
this is a

854
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,760
ah

855
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,699
so so the way at least you know I like

856
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,099
to think about anything when you do

857
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,739
operational effectiveness right it's not

858
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,199
about technology technology is one just

859
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,500
one layer when I think of a pro not just

860
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,480
me I mean any program that you think of

861
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,099
not just cyber security for that matter

862
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,200
you think of any Technology Program any

863
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,359
business program there are always four

864
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,280
layers to building a good program right

865
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,320
there's the people aspect there's the

866
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,000
process there's the technology and then

867
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,820
you have to govern the whole thing

868
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,260
um even if you don't have one of those

869
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,859
pillars working well your whole program

870
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:15,900
stops working effectively right you can

871
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,000
buy all the technology in the world but

872
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
if you don't have the right people to

873
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,180
operate it it's not going to work

874
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,280
effectively you may have the technology

875
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,560
and the people but you don't have the

876
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,960
processes then you may operate it once

877
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,000
well you may operate it second time well

878
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
the third time it's going to fall apart

879
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,359
right and if you don't have the

880
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,560
governance

881
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,480
you may you know you may have people

882
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,280
process technology but when you have to

883
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,140
go upgrade or buy a new technology if I

884
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,180
go to my boss and say you know give me

885
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,140
another

886
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,240
you know two crores to go buy this he's

887
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,980
gonna say what for what value did you

888
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,619
add right so you got to have all four

889
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,079
layers working effectively and I don't

890
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,599
think any organization can claim that

891
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,980
they're doing it a hundred percent you

892
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,920
know even if you get to 50 Effectiveness

893
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,380
maybe 70 percent your

894
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,660
you know you'll probably reduce exactly

895
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,339
that's that's a very high number right

896
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,720
I'm quoting Silver Bullet technology

897
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,280
exactly so automation helps you know uh

898
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,140
again you know we keep hearing these

899
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,240
reports that there are about 2 million

900
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,720
jobs globally open for cyber security

901
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,760
that's a number no one's validated sure

902
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,320
we can say five million I mean the

903
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,060
number keeps expanding every day right

904
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,420
so who knows what it is but uh we gotta

905
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,320
think about

906
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,240
you you just can't have enough people

907
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,099
doing the work you got to think about

908
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,599
automation you got to think about how to

909
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,900
make people more productive uh so on and

910
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,480
so forth so I guess you know as uh

911
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,099
you're saying there's no Silver Bullet

912
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,800
to this this is a a constant battle that

913
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,300
we have to keep fighting but job

914
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,940
security right and it helps

915
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,680
thanks uh thanks for taking that I think

916
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,900
we had one more question from this side

917
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,700
hi

918
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,640
so uh as you said uh there are ttps

919
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,440
which Defenders and attackers both have

920
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,839
pain uh attack for attackers to change

921
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,740
and for Defenders to detect okay so my

922
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,940
question or there are two questions

923
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,099
actually what actually creates

924
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,060
actionable intelligence according to you

925
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,040
are there any other parameters other

926
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,260
than our security assessments or this

927
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,060
assessment sock are there any other

928
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,980
parameter which creates actionable

929
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,240
intelligence

930
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,599
first if yes then what is the actual uh

931
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,359
like a proper way to disseminate them to

932
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,339
various organization or within the

933
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,079
organization so that everybody can be

934
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,820
able I think that's an excellent

935
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,560
question I'll take a shot if you don't

936
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,359
mind yeah so sorry but uh that again

937
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,280
that's a characteristic of the threat

938
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,839
Intel you talk about right actionable

939
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,240
but how do you define whether it is

940
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,740
actionable or not right and I'll go back

941
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,140
to the basics drawing board there are

942
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,060
four types of thread intelligence that

943
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,579
we deal every day strategic tactical

944
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:57,420
technical operational and action on each

945
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,700
of will vary right because Technical and

946
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,560
Technical I know it's more that

947
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,060
technology will understand I'll be able

948
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,980
to act upon it I'll be able to tell

949
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,200
technology what to do hey block this IP

950
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,420
I can I can tell firewall right hey uh

951
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,760
block this signature on EDR I can defend

952
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,800
that technique so that is doable when it

953
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,480
comes to the strategy and operational it

954
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,520
has to be more human driven and that's

955
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,619
why I say that threat Intel has to be

956
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,200
covered holistically and you woman is an

957
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,180
equal important participate when it

958
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,640
comes to the digesting processing and

959
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,240
actioning strategy and

960
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,980
operational intelligence at the same

961
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,320
time so again based on the type of

962
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,060
intelligence I would go and try to

963
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,579
define the actionable and again in each

964
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,980
of the category uh the actionability of

965
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,839
the Intel will vary on the quality of

966
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,579
Intel that you are receiving right if

967
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,440
somebody is sending uh telling you that

968
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,720
hey there is a bomb threat in Goa that's

969
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,300
not an actionable Intel for me it has to

970
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,520
be specific that there is a bomb threat

971
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,740
in Goa 9 A.M Sunday morning right I know

972
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,380
I I need to act upon it so it has to be

973
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,820
very specific and that's why it will

974
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,560
depend on you know the source and the

975
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,839
quality of the Intel that you receive uh

976
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,820
I hope that answers yeah thank you one

977
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,210
more oh oh sorry

978
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,640
[Music]

979
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,740
I don't say it's a Sunday tomorrow I do

980
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,060
not need to really worried what do you

981
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,060
know that we don't so only to add

982
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,960
additionally is on the common uh grounds

983
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,180
of disseminating such information at

984
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,560
least uh uh security uh as a industry

985
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,960
Forum used to collaborate way too well

986
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,839
those days during the eras of say the

987
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,780
the firewall and IPS IDs time op SEC

988
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,420
used to be there but currently at least

989
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,160
there are way too well established

990
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,800
protocols like sticks taxi I'm sure most

991
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,780
of you would be aware so uh

992
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,420
interoperability dissemination at least

993
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,000
there is a industry-wide adoption of how

994
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,520
do we communicate to each other so that

995
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,560
definitely is there yeah that's a very

996
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,020
excellent point you know

997
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,579
interoperability right because like so

998
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,260
many diverse set of Technology coming in

999
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,180
Source space threat Intel space firewall

1000
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,820
space interoperability has to come in

1001
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,380
and I think that's more a behavior we

1002
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,480
all have to push where whether it's all

1003
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,579
about consuming and threat Intel or Auto

1004
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,200
mating something or orchestrating

1005
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,000
something tomorrow you replace the

1006
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,980
technology correct are you having an

1007
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,780
interoperable technology right does it

1008
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,700
support the standards like stick sexy or

1009
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,140
cacao which is being now defined for

1010
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,640
orchestration right correct that's a

1011
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,980
very important aspect to look after when

1012
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,839
uh you know if you're looking for any uh

1013
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,000
technology so if you look at most of the

1014
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,579
customer requirement today when we adopt

1015
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,740
any security Technologies an

1016
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,780
interoperable parameter and adoption to

1017
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,060
say these well-known protocol standards

1018
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,400
to talk to each other becomes a bare

1019
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,960
minimum criteria when we adopt

1020
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,480
technology yeah I think looking at time

1021
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,160
we'll take one last question from the

1022
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,420
side one one uh please if you don't mind

1023
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,099
give you a chance to somebody else also

1024
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,240
so uh like yeah like we you guys are

1025
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,980
discussing about the I OCS and

1026
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,500
behavioral base so like let me correct

1027
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,260
for first like yeah if I am not wrong we

1028
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,040
required both so we based on the iocs we

1029
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,440
will analyze and identify the behaviors

1030
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,440
So based on that uh the my question is

1031
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,680
like as sir also mentioned the uh first

1032
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,599
so I also mentioned that still we are

1033
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,780
getting the bridges and all so and you

1034
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,640
also uh talk about the expiration

1035
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,460
cleaning parts so my summary summary of

1036
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,380
the question is like

1037
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,680
we have uh we have uh lots of breaches

1038
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,440
and lots of ioc's Behavioral base I am

1039
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,780
putting behavioral base aside for now

1040
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,579
and for ioc because ioc is the main main

1041
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:42,900
portion of the behavioral base to

1042
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,680
analyze so for for false positive like

1043
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,900
for that Intel we are getting many false

1044
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,960
positive also and we are not uh like uh

1045
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,839
focusing on like uh cleaning up on that

1046
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,880
part like individually we are doing like

1047
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,820
in our corporate it's one IP we can

1048
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,240
clean up when the when the that

1049
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,859
organization will come to us we can

1050
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:09,480
clean so what we can do like as a let's

1051
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,040
suppose one one threat in their

1052
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,680
organization how we can validate and how

1053
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,980
we can uh like reduce the database and

1054
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,040
false positive things in uh so like it

1055
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,859
helped uh anybody wants to take the

1056
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,300
question more from a false positive

1057
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,339
reduction and you know I think uh if I

1058
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,500
understand the question correctly is uh

1059
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
say if there is a TI feed which is given

1060
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,260
such and such is a black uh blacklisted

1061
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,900
IP if that is actually a false positive

1062
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,420
trigger for you within the company say a

1063
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,180
bot trigger has happened uh internal to

1064
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,460
a company but how do you identify or

1065
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,440
eliminate that being from a black no

1066
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,619
might be is a true positive at that time

1067
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:52,140
but now it's expired or it is a actual

1068
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,359
false positive or whatever so for that

1069
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,460
how we can validate and how we can

1070
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,619
reduce that solely we will get accurate

1071
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,540
result understand see none of these

1072
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,000
insecurities in security especially all

1073
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,980
of these pillars has to go in tandem

1074
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,800
right d a is one of the pillar like we

1075
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,660
what we talked about although we didn't

1076
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,480
touch the identity identify pillar uh

1077
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,420
way too stronger uh TI is actually a

1078
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,460
part of the predict uh pillar that is

1079
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,440
coming our way the predict has given you

1080
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,599
an Insight telling that potential this

1081
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,880
could be a

1082
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,980
H there is an indicator that I am seeing

1083
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,380
such and such machine is behaving

1084
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,020
rogually right so that's an indicator

1085
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,540
that it has it is exhibiting behaviors

1086
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,280
which is potentially equivalent to that

1087
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,740
of a compromise machine that is an

1088
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,599
intelligence for you the intelligence

1089
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,880
has to work in tandem with the rest it

1090
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,980
could be your response team which will

1091
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,599
have to pick up the intelligence to

1092
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,000
perform analysis right so the analysis

1093
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,520
might come up telling that yeah it

1094
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,040
exhibited a behavior but the behavior is

1095
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,099
more or less close to my production

1096
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,560
applications Behavior so I would want to

1097
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,500
call it into a

1098
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,420
false positive and take it so TI don't

1099
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,339
consider it as a standalone function it

1100
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,319
has to work in tandem with the yes rest

1101
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:08,700
of the four functions to make it

1102
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,040
effective yeah and just I'll add one

1103
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,960
more thing just to summarize there right

1104
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,079
you said you have to also score your

1105
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,700
Intel I was just telling that right and

1106
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,920
that scoring cannot be static it will be

1107
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,079
a dynamic right as I said IP is bad

1108
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,700
today but how much bad I think whatever

1109
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,500
point that it's not zero or one it's

1110
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,380
between 0.8 0.9 but that will also vary

1111
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,359
based on the situation today it's 0.9

1112
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:32,040
you go ahead and block it but tomorrow

1113
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,720
it goes 0.2 you have to go and unblock

1114
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,599
it but how you define that 0.8 or 0.2

1115
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,540
today that's a tricky part and that has

1116
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,640
many parameters to look into for example

1117
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,640
relevancy a relationship to the ongoing

1118
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,680
campaigns there are many I can go in

1119
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,540
depth but there are many parameters

1120
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,920
which will contribute to the current

1121
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,380
score of the Intel that is one aspect of

1122
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,780
looking at and and also second is the

1123
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,579
there is a concept of internal

1124
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,200
intelligence while we focus lot on

1125
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,400
external intelligence what is coming

1126
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,380
from outside but you as an organization

1127
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,420
are also generating yourself lot many

1128
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,099
intelligence because you are also facing

1129
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,200
so many attacks every day a firewall

1130
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,480
proxy area right so you also end up

1131
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,220
generating that Intel are you harnessing

1132
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,900
it are you correlating with the Intel

1133
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,000
which you got from outside are you

1134
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,099
telling at single place that hey I

1135
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,099
received this uh URL is a bad but when I

1136
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,900
investigated this was false positive so

1137
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,940
next time this URL comes don't think

1138
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,920
this is a bad so that's an internal

1139
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,720
intelligence also you harness and

1140
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,760
generate it it has to marry some place

1141
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,740
and give you more uh you know visibility

1142
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,579
in fact very uh very vital model even in

1143
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,260
the cyberspace to look up to is the

1144
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,359
fraud analytics model so if you look at

1145
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,339
fraud analytics a lot more of

1146
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,260
intelligence gathering happens from the

1147
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,420
internal data what is relevant to me

1148
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,819
while the external code actually add

1149
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:50,220
value to it for more to do with internal

1150
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,440
right so if you look at majority of the

1151
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,020
threat Intel players today and as

1152
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,900
customers when we consume ta also the

1153
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,940
relevance from what we see internally

1154
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,339
place a far more significant role than

1155
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,020
Standalone what is coming from outside

1156
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,780
so we learn a lot from personally I

1157
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,000
learn a lot from looking back into the

1158
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,700
fraud analytics model and then leverage

1159
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,180
similar model back into to my ti when we

1160
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,880
took most of these strategic decisions

1161
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,280
so relate back to fraud analytics model

1162
