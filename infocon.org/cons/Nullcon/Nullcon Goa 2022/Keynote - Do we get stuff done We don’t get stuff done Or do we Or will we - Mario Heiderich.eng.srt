00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,580
yes we can see the slides fantastic

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,000
so I am honored to deliver the keynote

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
for this fantastic event and the title

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,020
of this keynote is do we get do we get

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,880
done we don't get stuff done or do we or

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,160
will we maybe soon

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,699
my name is Mario and I'm a

12
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,560
self-proclaimed ex-researcher and now a

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,239
lecturer for the Euro rural University

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,340
in bochum I also created a company in

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,260
Berlin that is called q53 and we do pen

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,120
tests and I wrote a couple of books a

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,860
couple of papers maintain a couple of

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,780
projects and if you feel the need to

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,000
reach out to me then you can do so using

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,719
the contact info below

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,039
welcome

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,480
everybody

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,180
finally another nail con that is not a

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,820
remote conference not the first null con

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,500
that is not a remote conference past the

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,180
pandemics but the second one because as

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,559
mentioned we had one in Berlin already

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,600
it was a way smaller event but still

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,060
fantastic and I was thinking how many

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,040
years did we actually wait for this to

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,799
happen like for me it was like two years

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
three years at least and for me this is

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,400
like the first actual travel that I hit

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,720
in a long time that was like a

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,920
cross-continence to view another

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,220
conference and I am very excited to be

37
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,119
here

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,020
foreign

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,820
I would like to talk a little bit about

40
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,439
the talk structure that I have planned

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,659
for today we have two Acts

42
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,700
the First Act is we don't really get

43
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,799
stuff done and which I will speak about

44
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,720
how in cyber security we don't really

45
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,640
get anything done I mean we get some

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560
things done but certain things we just

47
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,479
don't get done and we keep beating

48
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,520
around the bush and it might be that we

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,140
could do a little bit better in some

50
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,340
regards

51
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,860
and in the second act of this talk I

52
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,960
will talk about how we might soon get

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
stuff done because I sense a change in

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,799
paradigms in several areas in several

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,840
Realms and I I have a good feeling about

56
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,939
this and I'm more optimistic about that

57
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,280
than I was a couple of years ago so

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,899
let's see what this will bring for us

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,619
first of all the talk title involves the

60
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,960
word we and we need to clarify on what

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
does that actually mean who is we

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,700
as mentioned I'm coming from the web

63
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,800
security company so I can mostly speak

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,379
on behalf of that Community I do not

65
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,120
know if we get stuff done in the

66
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,440
hardware community in other communities

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,599
probably you do but on behalf of the web

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,640
security Community I can safely say we

69
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,560
don't really get too much stuff done and

70
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,120
that sometimes makes me a little bit sad

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,220
but as mentioned as well I'm also

72
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,900
optimistic about the current trends and

73
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,840
I want to showcase some of them to you

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,900
first of all I want to dive into the

75
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,300
past and I want to go way back in the

76
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,280
past and talk about times when people

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,560
also didn't get stuff done but then some

78
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,220
other people basically raised up and

79
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,379
Rose up and managed to kind of do

80
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,519
something that was fundamentally

81
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,160
important groundbreaking and got us to

82
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,280
the point of really getting stuff done

83
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,379
the first person I would like to talk

84
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,800
about is this gentleman here does anyone

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,860
per chance know who that is

86
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,340
anyone has any idea who that is

87
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,220
that is Edward Jenner

88
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,019
he is known as the father of vaccination

89
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,599
his idea back then was when seeing that

90
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,819
lots of people starved from Catching and

91
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,940
Contracting smallpox that it might be

92
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,220
interesting to try something that no one

93
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,720
has tried before

94
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,300
he saw a relation between smallpox and

95
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,379
cowpox

96
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,440
and he thought well maybe if we give

97
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,780
people cowpox which was a way more

98
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,180
harmless variant of smallpox and maybe

99
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,280
if their bodies adjust to that maybe

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,500
then they won't get smallpox

101
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,260
and believe it or not that crazy idea

102
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,819
just worked

103
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,239
so his work effectively saved more lives

104
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,860
than the work of any other human that is

105
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,180
what some people say and I think they're

106
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,220
right because he effectively invented

107
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,799
the concept of vaccination he basically

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,260
gave people a harmless disease to make

109
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,400
sure that they couldn't catch a bad

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,900
disease because their body then was

111
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,080
already prepared a crazy idea back then

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,180
revolutionary and savior of Million

113
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,040
Lives as a consequence

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,900
here's a small quiz question

115
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,939
does anyone here know what the word

116
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,418
vaccine actually means anyone has any

117
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,579
idea what the word vaccine means I

118
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,959
didn't know before preferring this talk

119
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,820
and I was baffled

120
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,940
the word vaccine means cow because the

121
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,220
idea was to take cowbox to prevent

122
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,100
smallpox so he gave people a cow disease

123
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,780
and the process thereof was taken that

124
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,180
was called vaccination and vaccine means

125
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,000
cow look it up so every time you get

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,919
vaccinated you actually get cowed but

127
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,840
hey just I'm pretty sure you're the one

128
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,100
if you didn't want to know that right

129
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,740
all right so what I'm trying to point

130
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,360
out is here he had a fundamentally

131
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,340
groundbreaking revolutionary idea with

132
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,100
tremendous positive consequences he did

133
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,720
something that no one did before and it

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
worked

135
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,820
does anyone know who that person is

136
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,280
any idea

137
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
well this person and having a little bit

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,220
of a trouble to pronounce his name

139
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,340
properly is he nuts Philips samelweiss

140
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,160
he is today known as the savior of

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,419
mothers

142
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,100
he basically invented another

143
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,660
revolutionary thing that no one would

144
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,759
ever think of and that is washing your

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,020
hands

146
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,780
so he came up with the idea of saying

147
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,960
well lots of women who are giving birth

148
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,060
to the children at the hospital die

149
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,060
after being well helped by the doctors

150
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,340
and then he found out that those doctors

151
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,740
for before helping those women giving

152
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,539
birth were actually working on dead

153
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,220
bodies to kind of study the human

154
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,960
anatomy it's a little bit unappetizing I

155
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
hope you're having breakfast already but

156
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
he basically found out that there might

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,900
be a correlation between mothers dying

158
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,539
and before that doctor is working on

159
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,180
dead bodies and he recommended to people

160
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,400
please just wash your hands before you

161
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,780
help those women

162
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,479
and it worked his work saved millions of

163
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,280
lives millions of mothers

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,080
and well

165
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,020
despite that despite that simple trick

166
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,120
that he came up with he was mocked by

167
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,460
his community and declared insane

168
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,520
his story is actually tragic because he

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,320
was put in a mental wart

170
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,419
and then allegedly

171
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,580
the people in the mental ward beat him

172
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,919
to death so he died a tragic death and

173
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,780
his work was not really valued by anyone

174
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,460
at the time until people figured out

175
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,639
that what he did actually reproduced and

176
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,979
indeed had the desired effect more

177
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,000
people would survive

178
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,460
has anyone ever heard of this lady

179
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,979
anyone

180
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,979
this is Rachel Luis Carson she is known

181
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,539
publicly as the savior of the

182
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,800
environment as we know this today

183
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,479
because she was the one who actually

184
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,039
made the topic of environmentalism

185
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,560
popular predominantly in the US and from

186
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,900
there all over the world and her work as

187
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,880
you can imagine was hated by the

188
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,199
chemistry industry by the chemical

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
companies because she came up with the

190
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,400
idea that certain chemistry and certain

191
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,740
fertilizers actually go into the

192
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,360
groundwater and do tremendously bad

193
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,220
things to people around

194
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,319
and she basically was the one who put

195
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,720
her life energy into enforcing or

196
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,580
managing the enforcement of those

197
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,259
chemicals to be forbidden and to no

198
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,660
longer be used by companies by farmers

199
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,520
and so on and so on and thereby save

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,160
tons of lives and the environment and is

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
basically also the reason why the United

202
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,460
States right now have the U.S

203
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,380
Environmental Protection Agency

204
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,539
and of course her work wasn't really

205
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,280
greeted with much empathy and sympathy

206
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,620
back then and her enemies as usually in

207
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,120
this particular area would like to try

208
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,220
to silence her but basically saying well

209
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,139
she is just amateurish and emotional

210
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,940
don't listen to her but without her we

211
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,620
wouldn't be where we are before where we

212
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,539
are right now

213
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,000
now we want to move forward a little bit

214
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,979
in history and have a look at this

215
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:47,699
person

216
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,160
do you know who this person is

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,020
you might know who this person is if

218
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,520
you're for example one of the sponsors

219
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,479
that ladies and gentlemen is Mike West

220
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,780
she essentially co-invented the topic of

221
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,280
same-site cookies

222
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,800
which is a very simple yet extremely

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,259
efficient technology to effectively

224
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,539
eliminate an entire attack class

225
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,000
he had the idea of saying well look we

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,460
have csrf cross-site request forgery

227
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,020
which is a major topic on web security

228
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
and one of the fundamental flaws in HTTP

229
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,960
and how websites work and well we

230
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,699
couldn't get rid of that issue for the

231
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,220
past 15 to 20 years

232
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,460
had it not been for him inventing one

233
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,099
single additional cookie flag that you

234
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,740
would be able to set on your own in your

235
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,719
browser for your web applications that

236
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,159
would basically prevent the entire

237
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,520
attack pattern of sea surf from working

238
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,380
and it was working so well that Google

239
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,720
and also later on Firefox and the other

240
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,700
browser vendors decided to say well

241
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,680
let's just like turn this thing on by

242
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,779
default to make sure that whatever

243
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,760
happens unless you're deactivated

244
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,820
purposeful your website and your users

245
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,880
are safe from csrf attacks and by that

246
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
by that minor change by that seemingly

247
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,140
Small Change he literally eliminated an

248
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,640
entire attack class and saved millions

249
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,080
of users from getting their accounts

250
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,300
stolen getting the data stolen or Worse

251
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,320
happening

252
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,360
I hope there is no tragedy story

253
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
attached to him I hope he's fine I'm not

254
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,420
sure is he the chance here or anyone who

255
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,279
knows him well anyway Mike if you're

256
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
here I hope you're fine and if you're

257
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,740
not here I hope you're fine as well of

258
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,459
course

259
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,459
and now with that small Excursion in

260
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,040
history I would like to introduce the

261
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,080
second act and I will talk more about

262
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
the present where we are right now and

263
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
uh well hopefully we all wash our hands

264
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,380
in the year

265
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,980
2022 where we are right now we did

266
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,720
overcome a couple of problems from the

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,560
past

268
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,740
we did for example effectively learn

269
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,560
maybe also just recently that washing

270
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,820
your hands will in fact prevent sickness

271
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,920
so we overcame that problem we learned

272
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,140
about basic hygiene and it's quite rare

273
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,580
that in a hospital you would have

274
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,519
problems from lack of hygiene and we

275
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,800
also learned this for our lives at home

276
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
to make sure that we kind of

277
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,480
have a little bit of a positive impact

278
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,339
on how the pandemic spread and it

279
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,380
doesn't spread too much we also overcame

280
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,060
as mentioned through the work of Mike

281
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,279
the problem of crossover forgery like

282
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,260
this problem is literally more or less

283
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,380
done as a pen tester running a pen Test

284
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,380
Company csrf issues are something that I

285
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,360
don't really see anymore in our reports

286
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,120
because Mike did it Mike basically saved

287
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,760
us from that that no longer exists I

288
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,620
wish we would see the same with

289
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,240
different bug classes but we don't yet

290
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
which is getting us to the topic or

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,620
we're not really yet getting stuff done

292
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,019
we also more or less overcame the fear

293
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,459
of vaccination that was Haunting the

294
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,220
people back then at regeneres age but uh

295
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,320
well not for everybody as you can

296
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,060
imagine but mostly we overcame the fear

297
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,040
of explanation so hey that is progress

298
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
no

299
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,339
but there's also a bunch of problems

300
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,200
that we have not yet overcome

301
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,940
so if you drink too much soda we've

302
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,560
still loud very loudly we haven't

303
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,600
overcome the problem of SQL injection

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,399
and we have not yet overcome the problem

305
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,019
of cross-site scripting so there's a

306
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,399
bunch of problems that we have not yet

307
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,620
managed to overcome although they are

308
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,779
quite trivial and technically quite easy

309
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,600
to solve yet we're still struggling and

310
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,120
I wonder why that is and I wonder what

311
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,220
we can do and I wonder maybe this event

312
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,839
might be one of the first steps to

313
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
actually get in the right direction of

314
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,740
really overcoming those problems and not

315
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,019
keeping to put patches on a broken leg

316
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
that thing with SQL injection and I

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,920
think you probably all know the basics

318
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,100
of SQL injection that is so crazy and I

319
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,500
do not understand why we can't manage to

320
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,600
overcome this problem because the topic

321
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,240
itself is just so simple this gentleman

322
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,779
here was well known around back then as

323
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,040
someone labeled as RFP rainforest puppy

324
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,980
That Guy created an article that was

325
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,480
published in frag back then I think was

326
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,000
Frack issue 46 and he basically said

327
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,860
well I found out that in web

328
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,540
applications that have a database

329
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,519
underneath it is oftentimes quite simple

330
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
to take user input and with that

331
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,720
influence the actual query that is being

332
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,459
sent to the database

333
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,040
basically something like that we have an

334
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,079
SQL query we select something from the

335
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
user table and then user input goes into

336
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,100
that query and then we can select more

337
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,480
than we would have selected otherwise

338
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,220
and thereby we get information leakage

339
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,959
or worse

340
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,240
that is not complicated right that is

341
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,640
very very simple something from a source

342
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,740
goes into a sink and then we can do

343
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,420
different things we can manipulate what

344
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,640
the machine does

345
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,920
people looked at this at the time and

346
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,620
they were a mind blown like how is that

347
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,680
possible that is insane and we cannot

348
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,480
understand this

349
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,240
Jeff or rainforest puppy

350
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,000
was confused because he himself thought

351
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,380
that this is kind of an easy problem

352
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,060
with kind of an easy solution just don't

353
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,380
do this anymore or do something against

354
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,180
it to kind of treat this securely yet

355
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,860
people did not comprehend this their

356
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,620
mindset was not yet ready he was then

357
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,380
receiving gazillions of requests for

358
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,300
Consulting and he traveled around the

359
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
country in the states and he would

360
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,680
receive insane daily rates like daily

361
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,260
rates up to 7 000 US Dollars just to

362
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,700
come to a company and explain to them

363
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,500
what is happening here what can we do

364
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,959
against the chef please help us he was

365
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,000
like you just escaped the input and then

366
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,220
you're good yes but it's so hard please

367
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,779
help us to understand this so people

368
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,459
just didn't get it done and that

369
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,920
happened many many years ago and we

370
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,899
still don't get it done we still sit in

371
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,040
front of this and wonder what is

372
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,019
happening how can we fix this why do we

373
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,760
have this problem what can be done there

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
is countless countermeasures against

375
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
this but we still and Pen tests find so

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,820
many SQL injections that it's really

377
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,500
confusing us to a point of not

378
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,940
understanding what we're actually doing

379
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,600
here how can we not get this fixed

380
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,100
another thing would be cross-site

381
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,839
scripting one of my personal favorites

382
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,120
in the realm of web security which was

383
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,860
discovered by Two Gentlemen called

384
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,720
Marvin simkin and Toby Barrick back then

385
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,519
working for a credit card company

386
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,560
there's a little bit of a debate on who

387
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,820
actually invented Crosshair scripting

388
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,980
who discovered it but the lower points

389
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,600
straight in their Direction and there's

390
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,519
some documentation that proves that and

391
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,079
they initially didn't even call it

392
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,639
cross-site scripting because the name

393
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,500
croset scripting is very very raw for

394
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,880
this kind of attack they called it

395
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,139
properly as it should be called

396
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,660
JavaScript injection because that's what

397
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,940
you do then it got rebranded and

398
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,639
re-researched by Microsoft and they more

399
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,320
or less created a small poll and were

400
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,519
wondering like how should we actually

401
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,040
call it how can we call it and at some

402
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,380
point the consensus was there to call it

403
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,940
CSS

404
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,860
cross-site scripting and then someone

405
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,839
said ah we have that already it's

406
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,420
cascading style sheets oh okay then

407
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,540
install a cross side scripting Xs and

408
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,800
then the term was born and everybody

409
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,660
left it so much because it went easy off

410
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,880
the tongue and uh well it's still the

411
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,699
wrong name but hey

412
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,760
we also still didn't solve it

413
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,980
and it's also not hard I mean that's all

414
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,839
that that's to it this is a simple

415
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,519
crossword scripting vulnerability as we

416
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,500
see it every single day every single day

417
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,079
20 years later it's still around we have

418
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,180
some HTML we have some beautiful PHP

419
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,639
where the username variable coming from

420
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,100
the get parameter array goes right into

421
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,899
the code is being outputted without

422
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,120
filtering and boom there you go just put

423
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,339
in some HTML just put in some JavaScript

424
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,959
and that's all you have to do yet we

425
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,720
can't get it done we can't get it fixed

426
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,699
all that would have to be done as a

427
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,920
maybe encode this a little bit or B

428
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,620
enable a system or use a system that

429
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,019
prevents this by default and I think

430
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,519
that is where the problem is we don't

431
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,260
have every anything that kind of

432
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,360
prevents this by default and if we

433
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,120
haven't we don't use it

434
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,139
so

435
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,000
looking at those two items and I think

436
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,740
we can come up with various other items

437
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,240
that point in the same direction we

438
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,519
seemingly fail to get stuff done we have

439
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,260
ancient bugs that are as simple as they

440
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,540
can be but we can't get them fixed we

441
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,220
can't basically arrive at the point

442
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,899
where we did arrive with sea surf just

443
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,760
getting it done with one simple setting

444
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,339
we failed so far to get it under control

445
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,920
and the consequences are tremendous we

446
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,720
see Financial loss we see reputational

447
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,540
loss Data Theft information leaks and

448
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,800
it's really really bad like the

449
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,240
consequences of process scripting and

450
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,339
SQL injection combined cost billions of

451
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,139
euros dollars or rupees or whatever

452
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,820
currency you take it's a lot of money

453
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,380
that goes down the drain

454
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,560
so we tend to think well washing our

455
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,420
hands when in hospital that's cool but

456
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,040
washing our hands when riding our code

457
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,600
no that's not for us

458
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,380
and anyone forcing us to use soap no we

459
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,639
won't let that happen either we're going

460
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,339
to write our code as we see it fit and I

461
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,899
think that is getting us closer to the

462
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,880
actual problem it took us more than 20

463
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
years to arrive here and realize hey has

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,040
it really been 20 years that we've been

465
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,899
plagued with SQL injection and crusted

466
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,300
scripting and nothing got fixed that is

467
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,259
crazy

468
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,120
because we have a lot of brilliant

469
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,500
people here security Engineers

470
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,120
developers system administrators

471
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,160
professors and post doctors browser

472
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,500
vendors specifiers policy makers and

473
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,139
everybody everybody else we all failed

474
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,000
to get it done nothing

475
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,880
there was a bunch of attempts that we

476
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,679
undertook to kind of get down content

477
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,179
security policy is one that I could

478
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,400
think about HTTP only cookies is another

479
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,900
thing that I could think about but none

480
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,179
of them actually fixed the problem it

481
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,220
was all just additional patches on an

482
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,380
already broken leg

483
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,900
and I'm wondering how can we finally get

484
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,699
it done how can we get to the point of

485
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,160
finally doing the right thing and no

486
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,140
longer put patches on the leg but

487
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,880
basically think about

488
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,460
how can we address the issue so we can

489
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,620
eliminate the buck class and not the

490
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,960
individual vulnerabilities

491
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,059
over the past 20 years we have been

492
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,980
dealing effectively with voluntary hand

493
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,860
washing we had the choice to wash our

494
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,140
hands but we also had the choice not to

495
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,760
do this and sometimes Under Pressure

496
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,039
deadline pressure Financial pressure and

497
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,679
so on we just choose not to do this and

498
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
the consequence is availability and the

499
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,860
consequence of the vulnerability is

500
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,440
usually damaged for someone else and I

501
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,720
say let's no longer do this let's no

502
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,160
longer fall on this voluntary approach

503
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,960
we tried this for 20 years and it's not

504
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,660
working let us rather work on new and

505
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,760
fresh ideas that make the vulnerability

506
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,460
as such Impossible by Design

507
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,220
and we can do this and we're pretty much

508
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,440
on the way to do so we're just not there

509
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,520
yet and I'm going to show you three

510
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,380
examples where it already happened

511
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,419
the first one we've already discussed

512
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,059
that was Mike with the same side cookies

513
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,100
where he basically said okay we need

514
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,860
something that makes c-surf impossible

515
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,840
what is the key the root cause of the

516
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,880
problem with sea surf it is HTTP it's

517
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,740
statelessness and the fact that cookies

518
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,360
are being sent along with every

519
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,799
subsequent request once they have been

520
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,520
set

521
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,220
so he said well let's make sure that

522
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,620
cookies are only being sent along with

523
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,720
actual requests and none of the

524
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,220
background requests that the user might

525
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,720
not notice or see

526
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,200
minor change but massive effect

527
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
and then it worked so well that

528
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,440
basically the browser vendors decided to

529
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,059
say well let's enforce this

530
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,400
let's just put it in all browsers by

531
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,679
default so let's take away the choice

532
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,780
from framework maintainers and

533
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,419
developers to turn this on but leave

534
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,340
them the choice to turn it off so it's

535
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,620
on by default secure by default that is

536
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,120
the magic

537
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,500
another system I would like to talk

538
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,179
about is trusted types and another

539
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,440
system that I would like to talk about

540
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
is element.set HTML

541
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,539
the first you know already it's

542
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,940
basically an on by default just deal

543
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,919
with it security mechanism it was rolled

544
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:23,700
out

545
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,679
it was announced to be rolled out when

546
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,940
it happened and people of course

547
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,620
complained and people realized that they

548
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,059
have to fix the web applications and

549
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,559
then they fix the web applications and

550
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,600
now it's there and see surf is gone

551
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,020
pretty much not 100 but we reduce the

552
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,760
attack service so dramatically that we

553
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,799
don't even notice it anymore no more sea

554
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,380
serve which is fantastic

555
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,660
with trustless types built by a friend

556
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,059
of mine over at Google stuff we follow

557
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,460
the same approach he was about to tackle

558
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,440
the topic of Dominic's ass which is

559
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,480
something that we also just cannot get

560
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,600
done because it's such a massive beast

561
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,760
and uh he realized the only thing how we

562
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,919
can get it done is make it impossible

563
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,140
by basically making sure that people

564
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,240
can't exploit it anymore and developers

565
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,280
can't build insecure replications any

566
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,980
longer by taking away all those risky

567
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,860
things where potentially bad content

568
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,380
could go into and forcing the browser to

569
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,480
say no I am no longer accepting this I'm

570
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,299
no longer accepting a string going into

571
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,059
inner HTML I'm no longer accepting a

572
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,460
string going into location href and I'm

573
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,080
no longer accepting a string going into

574
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,120
any other risk you think the browser

575
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,220
says no all you need to do is set one

576
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,720
header and I hope that this might be

577
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,640
default at some point as well but with

578
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,740
one header you can turn all that off

579
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,299
and what you would have to do to repair

580
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,919
your web application to be compatible

581
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,200
with that change is relatively small in

582
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
effort right the policy manipulate the

583
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,460
string object a little bit or kind of

584
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,320
add some extra code to the risky sources

585
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,360
and then you're gonna be good a

586
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,640
comparably small change for a massive

587
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,679
effect again with the chance of

588
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
eliminating an entire attack class just

589
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,640
in one go no more Dom exercise we can

590
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,260
get there we're almost there we have the

591
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,000
technical tools we just need to apply

592
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,500
them now

593
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,380
and the third would be element set HTML

594
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,840
when I started working on a client-side

595
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,419
sanitizer in the year 2014 I never

596
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,280
thought it would be going thus far the

597
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,900
sanitizer I'm maintaining is called Dom

598
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,640
purifier you might know it and right now

599
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,020
we have the situation that it's one

600
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,640
person maintaining this and that's me if

601
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,299
I turn Rogue if I turn uh de capacitated

602
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,100
or anything like this when we would have

603
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,320
a problem 30 million people per month

604
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,820
not only software would have a problem

605
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,860
so my decision was this can't be

606
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,659
maintained by me we need to find a way

607
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,220
and then I basically was lobbying for

608
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,679
this to be done by the browser itself

609
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,799
but then we made a Quantum Leap with uh

610
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,659
the collaboration with Freddy and with

611
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,520
Daniel from Google and we arrived at the

612
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,720
point of saying like look you know what

613
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,700
if we want to really tackle the problem

614
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,820
we must change HTML we must change the

615
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,820
standard we must find a way how it's

616
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,400
impossible for developers to create xss

617
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,500
vulnerabilities in the Dom we must take

618
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,059
away that attack surface without them

619
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,919
even noticing by giving them something

620
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,200
that is again secure by default

621
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,360
what we have right now is exactly that

622
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,600
in the olden days you would assign HTML

623
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,460
to an element on a website by using the

624
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,960
inner HTML property you would say

625
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,940
document body inner HTML is that kind of

626
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,640
stuff that just came in that's usually a

627
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,039
plain old xss and that's bad because

628
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,659
there's no security precaution there's

629
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,580
nothing that prevents you from doing an

630
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,200
error from providing something from not

631
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,179
properly escaping

632
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,039
but we propose a new thing and it's

633
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,539
already implemented you can play with

634
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,120
that what we have right now is no longer

635
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,659
element dot inner HTML but a new method

636
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,640
that is called element set HTML it's

637
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,900
already in Chrome it's already in

638
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,460
Firefox and Firefox still behind the

639
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,600
flag I think in Chrome it's already

640
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,980
fully rolled out

641
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,220
and you no longer have to use error HTML

642
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,799
you no longer have to use that insecure

643
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,900
property because now you have set HTML

644
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,900
and whatever you throw into set HTML

645
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,299
will automatically be sanitized you

646
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,720
can't have xss it's no longer possible

647
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,299
unless you really want to and put in a

648
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,919
configuration object that says like yeah

649
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,720
please re-enable xss because I miss it

650
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
so much but I mean come on like like

651
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,679
before this is secure and there's

652
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,480
what you have to do

653
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,059
code as you would do in the past and you

654
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,520
know you can't have a vulnerability

655
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,460
that is where we need to go that is the

656
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,620
goal that we need to kind of be after to

657
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,299
make sure that we have systems that

658
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,460
allow us to do what we do without Hassle

659
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,080
and to almost forget about security

660
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,419
because it's already baked in this is

661
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,799
what we have been missing in the past 20

662
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,480
years at least in web security but now

663
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,539
we're slowly slowly getting there

664
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,700
I issued a tweet a couple of weeks ago

665
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,860
in the end of June and that Creed was

666
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,020
well it was a little bit provocative and

667
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,580
it kind of stirred up some dust and I

668
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,780
basically said bye-bye cross that

669
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,820
scripting your time has finally come in

670
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,380
which I basically show the code that is

671
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,120
necessary to kind of get rid of cross-et

672
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,100
scripting and also by the time the flags

673
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,299
that needed to be activated in your

674
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,919
browser to be able to actively play with

675
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,840
is an experiment and some people were

676
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,820
like oh that's nice other people were

677
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,159
like yes but some people were like no

678
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,720
this is never going to work and some

679
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,340
people were actually outright angry I'm

680
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,860
not really sure why but it was

681
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,960
interesting to see the reactions and it

682
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,700
was also interesting to see the feedback

683
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,559
that was coming in the box that would be

684
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,940
filed the additional things that we

685
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,320
overlooked and I have the feeling that

686
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,120
there is momentum and that things are

687
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,500
moving in the right direction and it is

688
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,179
the same with trusted types also there

689
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,700
is a lot of momentum browser vendors are

690
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,960
picking up developers are picking up

691
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
framers are picking up and I hope

692
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,100
there's going to be more overtime

693
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,520
so in a more General view on things in a

694
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,500
more General perspective on things I

695
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,539
want to get us I want to see us get to

696
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,120
the point of having no more voluntary

697
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,220
hand washing hand washing when

698
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,780
programming web applications or any

699
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,400
applications

700
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,940
must be baked into the framework it must

701
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
be impossible to not wash your hands

702
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,900
what must be impossible to kind of get

703
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,940
around those restrictions that are there

704
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,100
dirty hands must at least be forbidden

705
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,220
or if possible made impossible

706
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,700
and it's technically the same with SQL

707
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,340
why do we still write our own queries in

708
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,520
the year 2022 why do we still go that

709
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,620
deep into the stack as developers and

710
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,419
write our own queries we have all the

711
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,860
tools that we don't have to write our

712
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,780
own queries we have RM we have

713
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,280
Frameworks we have abstraction layers

714
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,620
let's make sure that we can't write our

715
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,600
own queries anymore that this burden is

716
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,100
being taken away from developers so we

717
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,779
think we actually work on the things

718
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,360
that they like and can do well instead

719
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,460
of taking care of this tedious task that

720
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,919
is so prone to creating vulnerabilities

721
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,960
no more sending of cookies with

722
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,880
arbitrary requests that we have already

723
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,500
accomplished Mike did this with the same

724
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,360
side cookies and it's amazing it works

725
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
we have the proof right there no more

726
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
string assignments we don't want strings

727
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,000
anymore like let's get rid of strings

728
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,799
and web applications and trusted types

729
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,360
is the first step in that very basic

730
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,400
direction to say we cannot assign

731
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,080
strings anymore because strings mean

732
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,700
parsing and whether it's parsing there's

733
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,460
bugs and we don't want to have bugs

734
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,900
it's a good first step and I hope it's

735
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,520
gonna work and last but not least of

736
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,860
course no more dirty usage of HTML we

737
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,299
don't want to have dirty HTML anymore

738
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,340
but we can't be expected to clean it up

739
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,799
ourselves let the browser take care of

740
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,900
this let the baked and mechanisms take

741
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,980
care of this and let's make it

742
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,260
impossible for dirty HTML to have impact

743
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,179
our web applications because there is

744
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,039
something that protects us that prevents

745
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
bad stuff from happening without us even

746
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,960
spending a minute of thought on this

747
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,140
so I think with that I would really like

748
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,299
to kind of see the new paradigm that

749
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:29,039
basically supersedes the one from

750
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,659
yesterday the one from yesterday

751
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,659
basically says oh there is an issue Play

752
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,000
Let's Go patch it and that is not a good

753
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
Paradigm because that is reactive and

754
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,020
doesn't make any sense and it basically

755
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,880
ends up as something that is no longer

756
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,380
scalable

757
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,720
we also have a paradigm today as a

758
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,520
result from what we did in the past and

759
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,860
that is oh dear so many patches so much

760
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,260
work to do let's kind of invest more

761
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,120
resources into security and more and

762
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,400
more and more to kind of handle the huge

763
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,840
pile of bugs that we're already sitting

764
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,400
on the backlog is growing and we can't

765
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,380
do anything about this that's another

766
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,880
bad Paradigm that I don't want to see

767
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,919
anymore in the next five years so the

768
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,960
next Paradigm that I think makes sense

769
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,820
for us to consider and to research

770
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,159
towards is there can't be any issues

771
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,559
there can't be any bugs there is no way

772
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,659
to create Global web applications or

773
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,000
other applications and it is there by

774
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,240
default and only if we want to we should

775
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,919
be able to kind of work past those

776
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,860
security mechanisms but that must be a

777
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,960
purposeful decision anything else must

778
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,659
be secure by default and as I said

779
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,940
slowly we're moving there and slowly

780
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,380
we're getting there but it's still a

781
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,179
long road and it's still a couple of

782
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,100
years until we're gonna be there maybe

783
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,400
nalcon Edition 2030 will have us talk

784
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,020
about the topic differently and I hope

785
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,760
so but I think it's still a couple of

786
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,600
years

787
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,520
but it also depends a little bit on how

788
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
we here at this conference in the future

789
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
events of process issue I think our

790
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
Paradigm should be let's stop investing

791
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,700
into reactions only I'm not saying let's

792
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,700
stop investing into reactions entirely

793
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,380
because we still need to react to

794
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,299
incidents we still need to react to bad

795
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,820
payload to bad user input and to cyber

796
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,919
attacks of course but I would like to

797
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,620
see us not to invest into that thing

798
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,419
exclusively and sometimes I have the

799
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,919
feeling we do that we need to invest

800
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,260
more into something that is more forward

801
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,539
thinking more future safe

802
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,700
let's invest less into soft prevention

803
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,760
into like well if something bad comes in

804
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,559
then the waft triggers and the IDS

805
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,179
triggers and there's the lock entry and

806
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,679
then we hope for the best

807
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,299
that's not the way to go of course it

808
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,039
helps a little bit but it doesn't fix

809
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,039
the issue I think instead we should max

810
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,740
out on the idea of things being secure

811
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,020
by default we should utilize policies

812
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,120
the hands must be washed otherwise you

813
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,340
don't join the party we should utilize

814
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,799
Smart Designs we should make a framework

815
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,140
that allows us to say our hands can't be

816
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,059
dirty Maybe by wearing gloves or

817
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,080
something like this you get the picture

818
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,779
and Nets and that's the most important

819
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,059
part de-prioritize compatibility let's

820
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,580
no longer be nice with old and bad code

821
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,320
that should be fixed or deleted in the

822
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,480
first place no more bare hands

823
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,700
um no more lack of hand washing

824
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,559
basically let's arrive at the point

825
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,600
where all these issues would become

826
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,059
Impossible by Design enforced by the

827
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,640
platform enforced by the framework so we

828
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
don't have to think about this and we

829
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,419
can't make mistakes anymore

830
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,720
to sum it up I believe that at this

831
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,220
point looking at the history of web

832
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,140
security for the past 20 years and even

833
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,820
more in some regards

834
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,679
I don't think we can solve our

835
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,260
long-lasting problems by putting more

836
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,360
patches on the broken leg we need to

837
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,039
rethink the approach that we're taking

838
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,480
patch

839
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,059
last 20 years had its chance

840
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,940
and it worked to a certain degree but it

841
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,860
didn't solve the root causes of the

842
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,600
problems that we're dealing with so I

843
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
think it's time to switch gears we need

844
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,980
to think about policy about smarter

845
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,260
designs and about Frameworks and

846
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,419
programming languages and systems and

847
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,179
runtimes that are secure by default and

848
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,340
that may be I'm not saying it is but

849
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,679
that maybe the only way forward from

850
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,720
here on and that maybe the only way to

851
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,039
get us to the point of saying like well

852
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,520
we solved xss resolved SQL injection we

853
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,559
solve this we solve that now what other

854
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,940
challenges are there because there's

855
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,159
still enough to be done for us

856
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,620
and that of course requires initiative

857
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,779
and a certain degree of boldness let's

858
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,120
be bold and work on new ideas let's not

859
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,039
reinvent the wheel over and over and

860
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
over again we have done this in the past

861
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,600
and we've seen where this brought us

862
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,240
to a certain degree success but never to

863
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,679
the point of fixing the root cause and

864
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,940
never to the point of fixing the actual

865
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,919
problem so I'm hoping that this talk

866
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,559
inspired you a little bit to maybe think

867
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,539
into a different direction with regards

868
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,159
to information security maybe switch

869
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,140
gears a little bit and think about this

870
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,820
new paradigm maybe let it sink for a

871
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,620
while and then I would be very happy to

872
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,600
hear from you about your feedback and

873
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,340
maybe who knows maybe the next great

874
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,679
idea something such as for example same

875
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,720
side cookies or trusted types and the

876
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,480
likes is born on this event and maybe in

877
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,799
a couple of months we'll be discussing

878
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,659
this and saying like wow that is amazing

879
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,760
that actually changes the world as it is

880
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,200
for better and uh yes I hope that this

881
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,520
talk gave you a little bit of

882
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,620
inspiration again I'm very grateful for

883
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,940

information from about the historic

893
