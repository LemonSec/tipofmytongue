1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,259
uh hello welcome everyone uh thank you

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,840
for ending this talk uh so just to give

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
an introduction of what this is going to

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,059
be this is largely based on a study that

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,240
we did with a serving uh IPS officer

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,680
somewhere around 21 20 20 21.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,840
um so this is done by our Think Tank

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,699
deep Strat

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,199
um it's largely to figure out what is

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,580
the state of Industry with respect to

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,239
fintech fraud and how it evolves and uh

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,579
what can we do about it

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,940
Etc the co-author of this uh Mr Chandra

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,739
Mohan couldn't make it today so I'm

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,800
going to cover some part of it for him

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,160
uh so let's go ahead with it yeah what

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,640
is this talk about this is about we're

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,260
going to learn quite a bit about the

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,700
high level architecture of fintech

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,399
frauds and the second part about is

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
about what do you think from the point

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,320
of view of rodster and how do you how do

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,280
you basically

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,199
they think about the art of human

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,299
vulnerability exploitation

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,180
the third part I'm going to talk about

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,060
how to run a bootstrap fraud Enterprise

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,520
and scale it up uh the last part is

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,040
going to be about uh how to fight a

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,260
fraud at scale so this is largely how

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,000
the structure of the talk is going to be

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
yeah

33
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,400
so what is the high level architecture

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,799
of fintech rods now if you understand

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
this picture

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,180
this is basically gabbar Singh saying

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,119
that I have multiple personalities and I

38
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,060
need a lot a lot of IDs yeah so at the

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,280
heart of every fintech fraud is always

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,860
ID fraud there's really no fintech fraud

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,360
without an ID fraud I mean there is

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,920
something as a high level architecture

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,720
you need to understand yeah

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,540
uh so if you look at it from a pure

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,700
technology point of view

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,680
so this one you are probably largely

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
familiar with because this is how the

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
certificate management system of the

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,280
https certificate works so you have a

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,140
bunch of root identities they basically

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,719
certify intermediate identities and then

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,038
you have a whole bunch of human

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,619
identities on the other end yeah and

54
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,319
this is how largely

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,760
DSC providers digital sign providers

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,800
work they basically think of Technology

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,379
as a linear view but this is not how

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,560
actually fraudsters look at it uh they

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
think of it as a circular pattern yeah

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,120
so if you look at the bottom one they

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,860
basically create a bunch of root IDs

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,480
then create a whole bunch of

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
intermediary IDs then create human IDs

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,520
and then recycle it back into the root

65
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,080
IDs so if you think of fraud as a linear

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,239
Enterprise you would never really truly

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,580
understand how these guys work they

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,700
basically think in terms of graphs

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,340
topologies circles never lack linear

70
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,599
trees so so that is something

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,980
fundamentally you need to think in terms

72
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,540
of understanding the architecture of how

73
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,340
fraud works yeah

74
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,739
uh so the next problem that you see

75
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,959
about human identity is it's a pretty

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,720
hard problem uh because of this

77
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,340
unvariable

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,060
uh indicator called time because if you

79
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,440
really understand how human identities

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,360
work for fraudsters no matter what kind

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,060
of Rod they are engaged in

82
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,980
they invest on human identities they

83
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,800
have a very long term view about

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,440
human identities it is not a short-term

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,659
view so what happens is you create a

86
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,180
fake Identity or you take over your

87
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,700
identity you invest a lot of time and

88
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,459
energy to build it up and over a longer

89
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,140
period of time say three years or five

90
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,300
years or ten years that human identity

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
becomes a very valuable commodity and uh

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,819
then it becomes a trusted identity and

93
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,500
then you use a trusted identity create

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,860
uh certify other identities and so on

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,739
and so on so the fundamental nature of

96
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,440
human identity is that as a fraudster

97
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,060
operating on it if you can hit

98
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,400
assumptions on what the human identity

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,860
is based on then you're free so this is

100
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,659
like a statement that you normally see

101
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,180
on log analysis saying that if you can

102
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,959
escape uh detection of logs then you're

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,299
free so here they operate on the same

104
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,280
principles they say that if you hit

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
assumptions on human identity then

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,299
you're basically free so that is one of

107
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,560
the reasons why you you really

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,019
understand that human identity is a very

109
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,519
hard problem to solve it is not very

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,280
easy at all yeah

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,740
and so if you write down and think about

112
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,660
the human identity assumptions that

113
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,040
people typically make

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,259
uh so these are the common assumptions

115
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,820
that you would make as a technologist

116
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,460
you would come back and say no tumor no

117
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,740
two humans ever have the same Biometrics

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,020
and it would the next assumption that

119
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,180
underlies most of it is a database on

120
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,639
human entities are reasonably accurate

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,320
the third assumption that you typically

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,540
make is humans will not change their

123
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,759
body parts

124
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
and the fourth assumption is kind of

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,340
implicit

126
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,199
uh you make an assumption that human

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,699
body parts will not change on their own

128
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,380
so these are the four assumptions that

129
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,560
typically have on any human entity

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,580
fraudsters typically understand this

131
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,620
much well and hence they work towards

132
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,300
breaking those assumptions

133
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,380
and uh so this is last week's case so if

134
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,960
you look at what is basically said is uh

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,220
there is basically a fingerprint

136
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,160
changing operator you can go and get

137
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,139
your fingerprints Changed by doing a

138
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,139
surgery and this was busted out last

139
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,900
week so what they basically do is uh you

140
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,580
have a you have an entire supply chain

141
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,720
of people who can change your

142
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,060
fingerprints uh it needs an operation it

143
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,620
needs a stitch you need to let it heal

144
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,840
for like three months six months and the

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,400
next identity is usable for about one

146
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,100
one and a half years uh so if you look

147
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,800
at what this was uh very interesting is

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,500
if you were in a banned list of

149
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,440
fingerprints uh because you are deported

150
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,720
or you are basically marked as a b c d

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,060
as a scammer uh this is one way in which

152
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,380
you evade the whole problem you can

153
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,060
create a new identity order of just

154
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,979
changing the fingerprints uh this was

155
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,139
last week

156
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,539
um so this is one like one

157
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,820
uh example of where it doesn't work at

158
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,380
all yeah

159
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,080
so the next thing is this uh scalable

160
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,120
biometric generation this happened about

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,580
one and a half weeks ago this is another

162
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,280
example of how they think about changing

163
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,860
Biometrics so in this example what they

164
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,440
did is uh when you go for an update they

165
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
would just change your picture with the

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,300
picture of this camera and once you do

167
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,940
that uh it's pretty easy for you to get

168
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,919
loans uh because if you look at most of

169
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,560
the uh loan providers what they

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,080
typically do is they do an otpe they do

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,539
facial recognition kind of a thing which

172
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,639
Compares what you see on the video kmrc

173
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,740
is the same thing as what uh you see on

174
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,720
the identity document and in this case

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,580
by changing it on the supply chain they

176
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,039
effectively replace your identity with

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,780
something else they don't change your

178
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,160
fingerprints they don't change your iris

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,479
scans they just change your photographs

180
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,600
yeah so this is a very common form of uh

181
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,139
breakdown and if you look at how bad it

182
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,620
is oh so this is how bad it is so

183
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,960
uh you can just see that they obtain

184
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,419
Fingerprints of an authorized agent and

185
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,380
then the cost of this is just silicon uh

186
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,539
gel and uh

187
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,060
some part of you know an Irish

188
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,319
photograph a high resolution image

189
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,660
organizer Iris photographed so quite a

190
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,460
lot of this is commercially viable and

191
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,840
it actually happens at scale like so

192
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,699
that people don't know about it the only

193
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,099
time you know about it is uh is the

194
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,900
famous case of Sunny Leone where she

195
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,360
applied for home loan and then people CP

196
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,919
was denied the home loan because there

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,280
were like three 25 000 rupee loans that

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
were pending on her so I had

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,180
investigated that case uh it's pretty

200
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,860
interesting how they had actually looked

201
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,199
at it they precisely figured out which

202
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,000
vulnerabilities exist in what part of

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
the supply chain figure out how to

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,080
create forged identity documents and

205
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,660
take loan on her names uh so it's a

206
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,699
pretty sophisticated scam so just think

207
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,620
about uh when you think about fraud

208
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,259
always think about the first level of

209
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,720
identity fraud it always starts with an

210
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,099
identity fraud it doesn't actually

211
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,280
happen without it yeah uh so just a

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
quick question uh how many of you guys

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,660
have heard about the India stack just

214
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,259
put your hands up

215
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,000
the India stack

216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,099
okay that's of course that's a surprise

217
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,599
I usually expected a lot more hands

218
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,240
anyway have you heard about the fraud

219
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
stack

220
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,360
yeah okay

221
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,520
so this is how it looks

222
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,860
right uh so I'll go about explaining

223
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,539
some of the components in it and there

224
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,219
are some interesting additions here

225
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,080
uh so you you want to basically

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,880
distribute the work into core layer and

227
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,860
operational layer and what you'll see in

228
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,020
media reports and what you see when it

229
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,240
actually happens uh is is the

230
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,000
operational layer there the ttps change

231
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,519
all the time but at the bottom layer you

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,040
see there is a core layer and this is

233
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,200
where they usually operate uh in the

234
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,480
code layer you have identity Telecom and

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
Banking and uh if you really understand

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,060
why this is called layer because this is

237
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,300
where all the money gets routed uh and

238
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,279
identities are created at well I'll give

239
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,260
a very small example uh how many of you

240
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,720
guys have ever received some kind of SMS

241
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,899
says if you do not do a b c d or bank

242
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,000
account would be frozen

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,700
oh that's a lot of people yeah

244
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,000
yeah I expected it yeah uh so at the

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
heart of this uh you have to ask a very

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,779
interesting question let's say you are

247
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,160
one of those people who got fooled into

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
sharing your OTP and your bank account

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
get lost

250
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,420
what do you think is the chance of

251
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,399
recovery of that money

252
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,399
any violent guesses

253
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,260
no

254
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,740
very low yeah in fact the 0.5 percent

255
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,200
um and uh the reason why is it so is

256
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,540
because how the money gets routed uh so

257
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,459
I will give another example towards the

258
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,220
very end so what they do is they as soon

259
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,360
as the money hits their bank account

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,860
whatever the number is they just split

261
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,200
into multiple small pieces and instantly

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,899
and automatically routed towards a whole

263
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,339
bunch of bank accounts that is all over

264
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,019
the country so let's say you lost about

265
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,600
25 000 bucks it would be split into 1000

266
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,339
into 25 and be routed to many bank

267
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,440
accounts payment wallets and whatnot and

268
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,240
what not it's fully and totally

269
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,680
automated yeah they even have a payment

270
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,040
uh apis I've once in a Razer pay API uh

271
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,380
which uses a split one so how many of

272
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,640
you know about the split payment Thing

273
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,060
by any chance okay right so if you don't

274
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,279
understand how split payment Works uh

275
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,899
think of like an Ecom service provider

276
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,160
you bought something in Amazon which is

277
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,720
thousand rupees Amazon takes 20

278
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
commission so they only keep 200 800

279
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,580
rupees goes to the vendor so as soon as

280
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,380
the money comes they basically put it on

281
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,540
a nodal account hold it and then the

282
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,860
money gets noted automatically with

283
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,080
three plus one t plus or settlements uh

284
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,519
they use exactly the same payment

285
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,800
splitting thing that that fintech uses

286
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
as soon as the money comes into one

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,459
account is basically routed into

288
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,380
multiple accounts automatedly and you

289
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,880
can't trace the hell out of it yeah

290
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,040
believe me when I tell you that it just

291
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,220
instantly evaporates I we I had seen a

292
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,500
parliamentary MP losing 25 lakh rupees

293
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,019
and uh the bank basically paid him back

294
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,100
because they knew they could not raise

295
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,019
it back so such instances are pretty

296
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,140
Galore so if you look at it why the code

297
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,540
layer is interesting is because in the

298
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,459
core layer is when you need lots and

299
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,500
lots of SIM cards and you need lots and

300
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,480
lots of bank accounts and so the way in

301
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,000
which it works is that uh you need to

302
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,700
have a huge cache of pre-existing SIM

303
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,040
cards and pre-created bank accounts on

304
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,779
which you need control there are two

305
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,640
three ways in which they do it uh first

306
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,300
is uh hijacked identities uh so in the

307
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,920
case of hijacked entity is is like Sunny

308
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,660
Leone case where she didn't know

309
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,980
anything but this is hijacked identity

310
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,920
using uh loopholes and other systems uh

311
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,600
the second thing what we have seen is

312
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,820
called mule accounts so you would go to

313
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,920
a person in jharkhand and say look I

314
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,779
will give you 10 percent of the loot you

315
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:49,620
please give me your bank account

316
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,839
passwords I will manage it so this is

317
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,940
one way of actually operating it the

318
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,260
third thing is you may not even know

319
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,700
that your identity was compromised in

320
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,560
the open uh Bank codes on your name this

321
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,360
also happened in in Sunny Leone's case

322
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,920
so existing people ghost accounts active

323
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,980
collusion uh so all this happens on the

324
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,040
core layer uh so you could create SIM

325
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,860
cards and what not and whatnot and then

326
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,600
you'd see many people complaining about

327
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
WhatsApp accounts being used it's a

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,040
pretty popular one because you know what

329
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,019
end-to-end encryption no one can reset

330
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,980
yeah so this is on the uh core layer the

331
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,240
operational layer is what I told you

332
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,339
about they're pretty sophisticated in

333
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,079
using all the payment Stacks with

334
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,320
popular payment aggregators and the

335
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,519
registers themselves sometimes as

336
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,579
businesses sometimes as individuals

337
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,320
sometimes as llps quite often and of

338
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,300
course they know how to do fraud kyc so

339
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,760
scale so you call it EK VRC they call it

340
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,079
fkyc with obvious uh you know French

341
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,420
around it uh then of course use hacking

342
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,860
tools uh they're not pretty

343
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,500
sophisticated hacking tools most of the

344
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,940
hacking tools is about I'll send you a

345
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,320
link you click on it I'll put a spyware

346
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,000
on your phone and people usually do it

347
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,579
uh for variety of reasons TeamViewer

348
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,040
continues to be a very popular choice in

349
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
spite of many payment aggregators trying

350
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,100
to uh do an Android get applications and

351
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,899
uh you know they would just look at if

352
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:16,980
TeamViewer install they would not

353
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,980
operate uh so that is one the last bit

354
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,420
is very interesting

355
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,180
Sharp Shooters I didn't think that uh

356
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,060
you would have uh Sharp Shooters in your

357
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,220
fraud stack but this is a pretty new one

358
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,920
uh so you see you see the operation

359
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,839
layer most of the people see the

360
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,100
operational layer but they don't you

361
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,540
don't actually see the code layer but it

362
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,000
is pretty interlinked yeah so this is

363
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,399
the high level architecture of most of

364
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,339
the payment frauds uh this thing applies

365
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,940
both for individuals and for

366
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,600
organizations so when you see

367
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,940
organizations they may probably create a

368
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,500
non-existent shell company on your name

369
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,800
make you a director with your DSC etc

370
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,779
etc do import export licenses on your

371
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,600
name so this exists so you so this is

372
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,940
what when you see government news which

373
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,579
says that GST rides on shell companies

374
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,800
etc etc this is the one and then when

375
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
you see non-existent people and you see

376
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,019
uh so many new Forge identities are

377
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,700
found this is the reason I mean you

378
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,440
don't create a forged identity without a

379
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
long term purpose the long-term purpose

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,860
is to do this yeah

381
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,860
uh so next goes back to the art of human

382
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,560
vulnerability exploitation so this is a

383
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,060
scammer's view

384
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,310
and uh

385
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,700
[Music]

386
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,279
this is what you think of yourself uh

387
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,440
you think of yourself as the thinking

388
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,639
man

389
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,399
but this is what you are really a

390
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,019
linking man

391
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,180
right how many of you guys get it

392
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,040
notices from your organization saying do

393
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,560
not click the damn link everyone how

394
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
many of you do click the links

395
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,580
hmm

396
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,240
[Music]

397
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,699
yeah so this is really what you are and

398
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,199
they understand you much better than you

399
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,540
yourself yeah

400
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,519
uh and how do they think about you this

401
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,100
is how they think about you so they look

402
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,220
at you the human brain and uh you are

403
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,660
familiar with this idea of about attack

404
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,540
surfaces and every cyber security guy

405
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,680
comes and tells you reducer attack

406
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,480
surface reduce the rack surface

407
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,760
this is your brain attack surface as you

408
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,100
see from this camera

409
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,500
try defending against it

410
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,920
I can bet you would fail right so if you

411
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,260
look at the payment frauds it's pretty

412
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,540
sophisticated human exploitation it is

413
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,399
very low Tech you would not see some

414
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,339
commercial high grade malware uh or some

415
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,560
hacking tools etc etc but this is really

416
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,660
what you are yeah and they understand is

417
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,800
much better

418
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
and what is the space in which they

419
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,800
operate this is a space need to act fast

420
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,720
and this is the one emotion they know

421
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,839
how to trigger very well and uh what are

422
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,220
those two emotions that they know how to

423
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,720
trickle very well

424
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,000
uh this is it feed and career nothing

425
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
else only two strips in all our Fair

426
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,399
analysis there are only two scripts

427
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,160
there is really no other script uh that

428
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,380
works at scale much well and this is

429
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,240
fear and greed nothing more nothing less

430
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,500
yeah

431
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,320
and uh script number one this is what we

432
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,779
call as a nasty Bank official I'm pretty

433
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,459
sure you can relate to it how many of

434
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,339
you have met a nasty Bank official when

435
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,680
you interact with the bank

436
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,420
yeah

437
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,040
the guy who threatens you the guy who

438
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
doesn't give you a service

439
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,959
right this is the guy and uh so when

440
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,820
they call you and say that uh your

441
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,380
account is going to be suspended you

442
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,980
have not been kyc'd uh you have not had

443
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,740
transactions etc etc this is a script

444
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,759
they use

445
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,100
the keywords are usually this

446
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,940
and not the type Origin bank

447
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,180
yeah uh money go on and shut down so if

448
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,540
you basically do what we call as a

449
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,540
uh logistical regression analysis of the

450
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,399
scripts they use these are the four

451
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,079
words that you would find often in

452
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,139
different forms uh it the the emphasis

453
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,899
on the call recordings are specific uh

454
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,640
it will always trigger meltdown on fear

455
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,199
so remember that the need to act fast

456
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,020
button uh the intention as you know is

457
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,480
share OTP and click a link these are the

458
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,760
only two things they always do uh

459
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,260
everything else is like a variation of

460
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,880
this but this is the one

461
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,520
uh the National Bank official is again

462
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,339
very targeted demographic it works very

463
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,139
well on old people can you explain why

464
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,380
demographic is explains only one and all

465
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,179
people explain why

466
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,960
yeah go ahead

467
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,039
hello uh yeah maybe because they haven't

468
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,080
really kept up with technology and

469
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,600
haven't really gotten used to getting

470
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,960
communication through via let's say SMS

471
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,700
yeah and all people are much more

472
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,640
amenable towards uh these four words

473
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,799
particularly the first word government

474
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,620
yeah uh and that already anything works

475
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,720
very well uh the script 2 is the

476
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,419
friendly Bank official uh this is a

477
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,840
younger demographic 20 to 30 uh it

478
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
triggers excitement and feeling special

479
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,380
Works see I'm not I'm not trying to be

480
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,480
uh works very well uh with a certain

481
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,820
demographic uh particularly people who

482
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,780
earn a lot and uh so the keywords here

483
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,160
is free

484
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,500
cash back special

485
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,600
yeah and this is what failed a

486
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,220
parliamentary MP so you can imagine the

487
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,419
word special what it means for a

488
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,900
parliamentary empty yeah uh again the

489
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,220
intention is

490
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,440
click a link I mean this is the steam

491
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,580
what is operating that you would see

492
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,720
again and again

493
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,700
and uh so at this point of time you can

494
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,140
come and ask how well do these scripts

495
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,039
work

496
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,120
this is the data

497
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,179
so you see the first two one OTP shared

498
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,600
by victim pay via link kyc lab this is

499
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,580
like

500
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,360
1995 of the scam you'd see down

501
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,140
this is all something that we found uh

502
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,760
on the far analysis this is what it is

503
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,860
so you can think of

504
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,539
the TeamViewer app is interesting

505
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,700
because it's it was a very upcoming

506
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,620
thing then but it got stopped quite a

507
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,360
bit but the first three ones are pretty

508
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,039
interesting so this is this is how they

509
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,900
are usually operate the script one and

510
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,539
strip two is the first two three that's

511
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,980
about it yeah

512
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
and uh so now let's look back at this

513
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,299
OTP sharing

514
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,160
how often were you told that the

515
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
population is digitally illiterate

516
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,020
and so they if only the population is

517
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,919
digitally literate scams wouldn't happen

518
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,260
uh quite often but if you look at it

519
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,020
uh OTP is like such a common thing in

520
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,020
India uh it is both used for sharing and

521
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,780
for non-sharing so people come and say

522
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,240
show me your OTP uh like the blue dot

523
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,400
guy comes and asks for it uh the coven

524
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,140
guys comes and asks for it the Ola guys

525
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,140
asked for it Uber guys ask for it and uh

526
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,960
so what you have is you now have a

527
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,460
communication pattern

528
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,400
which is both shared and do not share

529
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,500
and how on Earth do you think the

530
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,539
population is going to understand this

531
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,220
I mean it's practically very difficult

532
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,900
because sometimes it's shares sometimes

533
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,120
it's not share so this is an abuse of

534
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,100
otpe that every one of us has created to

535
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,780
offer ourselves so there's no point

536
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,240
trying to come and say that oh my dad is

537
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,880
digitally illiterate he shared etc etc

538
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,980
what about the MP who sits in the it

539
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,660
Committee in the parliament I mean he

540
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,900
also lost money yeah so digital literacy

541
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,240
is just not a population problem but uh

542
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,980
anything goes for scale Building Product

543
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,400
problem so just imagine about it uh the

544
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,660
other interesting thing that we found

545
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,419
out when we did this uh is are they

546
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,520
actually recommends suspending bank

547
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,220
accounts based on the risk profile so

548
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,260
once in two years I get this call saying

549
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,179
through my bank Guy saying that please

550
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,919
you have to go re-key otherwise your

551
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,679
account gets suspended and uh sometimes

552
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,179
it's pretty hard for me to figure out

553
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,039
whether it is the bank guy who's calling

554
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,140
or is it the scammer so you need to go

555
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,400
physically to figure out what the heck

556
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,000
is going on and uh so so I've been

557
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
through this multiple recovery thing

558
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,299
like two or three times and every time

559
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,220
it's a stressful thing even for me so

560
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,900
imagine an old person or demon who

561
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,880
basically chooses to give OTP because

562
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,980
people can't live without bank accounts

563
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,660
at least after the pre after the

564
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,880
pandemic era uh while previously it may

565
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,580
be okay but that is like gone but if you

566
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,840
go back and tell there is a bank about

567
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,340
it the Garner would come and tell you

568
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,580
but that is a bank we wrote a very nice

569
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,659
circular on 2015 about fatca uh risk

570
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,520
profile risk analysis but how the hell

571
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,500
do you know as a consumer no you don't

572
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,539
so this Still Remains as a very popular

573
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,520
version of the attack and people keep

574
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,620
losing a lot of money about it

575
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,780
uh so

576
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,760
much easier to blame others for not

577
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,679
having digital literacy while

578
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,539
contributing to the literacy Problem by

579
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,760
asking for phone numbers all the time so

580
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,320
people often come and ask me my phone

581
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,880
numbers I usually come and say no I

582
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,980
don't give my phone numbers and it it

583
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,080
surprises a lot of journalists saying

584
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,460
that how do I reach you I said why

585
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,539
should you reach me on a phone number

586
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,480
right so that's that's the next thing

587
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,820
that you need to think about it uh so

588
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,039
what is your defense I have about 14

589
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,840
phone numbers sometimes I forget which

590
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,140
one I use for what uh uh I have about 75

591
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,900
email IDs probably another 20 more so

592
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,659
I've lost count of what I do uh so that

593
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,460
kind of is what you know prevents me

594
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,140
from getting defrauded but I don't think

595
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,179
it's a scalable solution so we really

596
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,500
have to think about what we are doing

597
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,840
with phone numbers yeah

598
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
so the next thing is interesting how do

599
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,400
you bootstrap a fraud Enterprise what

600
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,780
are the unique economics of the fraud

601
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,460
Enterprise uh

602
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,059
so this requires some VC speak yeah uh

603
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,440
so the first thing you need to

604
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,580
understand when you have a product

605
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,020
development company is the VCS come and

606
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,179
say what's your flywheel yeah how do you

607
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,640
spin the flywheel and make money this is

608
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,559
how the flywheel of making money works

609
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,820
for fraud

610
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,700
the first is always prep your IDs

611
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,980
the next is procure SIM cards create

612
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,659
bank accounts and wallets

613
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,700
rehearse two Scripts

614
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,559
profit is equal to income minus expense

615
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,140
I mean so they have uh so not many

616
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,900
people know that fraudsters are more

617
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,940
agile they actually use agile the wage

618
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,679
is supposed to be yeah they have project

619
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,039
management plans pmps targets schedules

620
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,280
weekly targets monthly targets uh it's a

621
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,840
pretty sophisticated Enterprise if you

622
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,820
look at it and in my personal opinion

623
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,200
they are the true agile practitioners

624
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,580
not the people who actually write code

625
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,600
yeah right and uh invest to discover

626
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,059
more tdps yeah

627
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,580
so they are the true investors I mean

628
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,559
every bit of profit is never given back

629
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,600
to the employees as bonuses uh it is

630
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,039
always invested on creating more and

631
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,039
more Enterprise Value uh for discovering

632
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,240
new to TPS

633
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,280
then it becomes your seat capital and

634
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,340
the circular ring runs yeah

635
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,140
yeah uh so just to give how they work

636
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,179
this is the unit economics

637
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,220
this is how the jamthara's cameras work

638
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,260
so you can understand how better it is

639
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,100
so my goal is 100 victims per month uh

640
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,799
at an average income of 2 lakhs that's

641
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,200
really what a guy has given a goal which

642
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,120
is about 2000 rupees per person per

643
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,440
month yeah

644
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,860
and uh so the way in which they work is

645
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,559
uh after every victim 10 victims they

646
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,020
just knock off the sim cards so as soon

647
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,820
as you get a success with one victim you

648
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,980
keep a counter it's an automated thing

649
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,900
it is not like a pin paper thing they

650
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,700
are truly uh Embrace a digital Vision

651
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,000
yeah so after 10 once it's automatically

652
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,460
thrown out uh so you could think of

653
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,500
about 10 SIM cards you need for 100

654
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,080
victims 10 per month is what you need

655
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,020
for 100 right and they have calculated

656
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,720
that uh surprisingly they have a

657
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
research Department uh the research

658
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,020
Department basically keeps track of all

659
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,460
government regulations particularly

660
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,799
around some cards and bank accounts uh

661
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,059
in fact the research department is so

662
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,320
sophisticated I once uh remarked to uh

663
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,720
toxicity line shoots nitin pie that he

664
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
wrote a very Think Tank type of a thing

665
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,280
which said uh the government should use

666
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,520
this for coven right two days later

667
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,200
after he published an article on

668
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
alignment I started seeing messages

669
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,360
which says in order to do this uh please

670
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,419
uh provide your OTP uh so these guys

671
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,340
actually keep track of think tanks much

672
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,559
better than what governments themselves

673
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,500
do yeah uh so between them they figured

674
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,600
out that with one ID you can get 18 SIM

675
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,240
cards and between four service providers

676
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
who never share data among each other

677
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,140
with one forced identity you can

678
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,140
basically get 50 SIM cards and so one ID

679
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,240
is equal to five months of Runway

680
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,400
and the max of two to three IDs per year

681
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,900
is really what they are interested in

682
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,340
harvesting and that's a pretty

683
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,620
manageable proposition yeah

684
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,140
uh so the next thing is ID and fraud

685
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,580
volume relationship

686
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,620
so if you look at it it is 24 lakh

687
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,260
income per year three IDs the value of

688
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,940
one usable ID is eight lakh rupee in

689
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,100
here what do you think is the value of

690
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,039
your ID on the data trade market

691
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,679
foreign

692
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,820
I once saw 5000 rupee

693
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,419
database of IDs which had about 1

694
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,000
million entries

695
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,980
so this is basically the attacker

696
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,679
Defender uh economic conundrum this is

697
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,179
not a technology problem this is

698
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,279
basically an incentive economy of scale

699
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,840
problem and they are far ahead than you

700
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,600
yeah so like I said IDs can be bought

701
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
forged obtained or even borrowed uh a 10

702
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,779
lakh IDs estimated income is 80 000

703
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,340
crores which is greater than all finte

704
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,039
companies in come put together yeah and

705
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,539
so fraud Enterprises I would probably

706
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,159
say are the most successful profit

707
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,600
making fintech Innovation you may

708
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
disagree with it but that's how it is

709
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,700
right uh and so as losses are

710
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,799
distributed among various Banks and

711
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,779
residents the scale of fraud is never

712
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,460
obvious from fragmented reports so this

713
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,260
is one area that you're pretty good at

714
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,260
you see escalated fraud in every one of

715
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,720
your company's private systems but who's

716
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,360
doing an aggregate view surprisingly you

717
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,539
know one and they actually Rebel in it

718
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,620
right

719
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,480
uh so I'll just give three examples of

720
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,520
this

721
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,140
the first is easy fraud so this is my

722
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,130
favorite yeah uh

723
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,500
[Music]

724
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,080
how many of you guys uh

725
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,960
heard about enumeration attacks

726
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,240
yeah quite yeah

727
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,860
so this is what they did

728
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,320
uh they procure uh for telephone numbers

729
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,179
in market and now they have to really

730
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,740
figure out which of those telephone

731
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,460
numbers is linked with an ICC a bank uh

732
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,380
this is how they do it

733
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,020
they just keep trying those numbers on

734
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,480
the ICICI Bank web portal and it comes

735
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,100
back and says OTP send you know that

736
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,419
number is linked with assess your bank

737
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:46,260
number

738
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,679
yeah and then what they do is uh

739
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,140
now they know that guy and do you know

740
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,140
how to get uh the name of the person

741
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,299
using their UPI ID

742
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,679
have you ever heard about a feature

743
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,860
which is I will give you an UPI ID and I

744
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,900
will note your name

745
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,539
surprise I see as a bank sells it

746
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,480
using a penny draw protocol

747
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,760
yeah yeah so officially they sell it as

748
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,380
a service so quite a lot of services use

749
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,020
it for doing penny drop protocol so you

750
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,940
get so think about how the scam works

751
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,640
right I mean you just basically get a

752
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,960
whole bunch of numbers in the data trade

753
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,779
market for 5000 at 1 million numbers you

754
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,820
run through this you get a nice subset

755
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,159
of bank accounts link with icsei you

756
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,840
then spend one rupee on it you get the

757
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,179
name of the person you call them and say

758
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,960
that uh

759
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,240
and in this particular case what they

760
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,059
did is uh they had convinced them

761
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,620
uh that they are actually calling from

762
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,679
Airtel yeah and uh there is a problem

763
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,380
with their kyce and please give me your

764
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,580
uh number to link the esm so this model

765
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,220
is what they use for taking over the SIM

766
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,440
card by pretending to be calling from

767
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,980
metal and somehow coursing them to link

768
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,279
a third party identity an email ID

769
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,100
into their uh

770
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,980
Airtel account and once you do that the

771
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,659
guy will basically take over that Sim

772
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:16,020
never visiting the store Yeah by just

773
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,440
doing an esim update and uh importing

774
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,240
into his iPhone

775
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,799
so you can imagine the steps in which

776
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,640
they have thought through this whole

777
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,159
thing and the gaps they have identified

778
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,100
uh so how many people how many accounts

779
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,500
this is a live far so this is what the

780
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,039
police guys found out

781
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,320
305 bank accounts two people ten adult

782
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,840
payment Banks 12 phone pay wallets 10

783
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,960
Ola money wallets other than there's 91

784
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,640
bills of punjab's state power

785
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,380
Corporation limited paid by fraudulent

786
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,080
transactions so you could see the entire

787
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,000
supply chain of economy how it works

788
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,039
like money just doesn't go into just

789
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,940
bank accounts but it also uh goes into

790
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,360
paying bills yeah so this is what I call

791
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,640
as a build discounting product uh

792
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,260
someone basically comes and says look I

793
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,360
need to pay my electricity bill I don't

794
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,159
have money the guy will say okay I will

795
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,700
pay you and I will take my 15 20 right

796
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,340
so this is a very well entrenched

797
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,799
functioning alternate economy and it's

798
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,360
fully digital so just be aware of what

799
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,100
you're dealing with right

800
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,860
uh this is another one the fingerprint

801
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,880
lifters

802
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,340
and so what they did is

803
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,559
uh they went to this Government website

804
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,980
which has property Deeds yeah and if you

805
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,600
look at the property and sale Deeds it

806
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,399
by default they ask you to put your

807
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,580
fingerprint on the sale deed and uh it

808
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,279
also has a ID details whatever that is

809
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,140
and they will take this fingerprint it's

810
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,120
a high resolution image

811
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,760
and uh

812
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,320
they will so this is the place where

813
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,880
they get it from so many of the state

814
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,440
government portals actually has sale

815
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,000
Deeds of your property documents with

816
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,380
your ID details

817
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,740
and uh they would do this

818
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,039
uh thermal scanners butter Paper thinner

819
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,500
gel glue image booster chemicals it's a

820
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,539
perfect Recreation of the fingerprint

821
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,179
and then they use it on aeps so quite a

822
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:10,380
lot of people actually lost money on

823
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,600
this yeah so this is another example of

824
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,159
how sophisticated they are so do not

825
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,539
discount them when you are creating

826
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,279
products right

827
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,620
the last one is my favorite export

828
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,440
licenses in arbit Raj so what they did

829
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,200
is so in case you don't understand I'll

830
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,520
just give a bit of context because the

831
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,020
last one

832
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,679
um

833
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,360
in order for you to do an export Import

834
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,559
in India you need to get what is called

835
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,860
as an IEC certificate and uh the IC

836
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,720
certificate requires you to apply an

837
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,940
organizational DSE where someone

838
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,179
actually takes a video kyc verifies your

839
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,000
face match etc etc etc so what these

840
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,340
guys did is uh they forced the documents

841
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,200
of the directors replace their

842
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
photographs you'll see them again and

843
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,100
again and then actually did a video kyc

844
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,100
got the DSE signed it and then once you

845
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,260
get in these export import licenses then

846
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,659
you can sell it in the market for a

847
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:03,419
discount or a high price so this is the

848
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,120
level of it how successful are they and

849
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,500
what's the growth rate this is the

850
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,860
growth rate

851
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,200
yeah so you can see 2021 is like the

852
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,460
Blockbuster here they have figured out

853
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,020
how to crack it and this is still

854
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,000
continuing I mean many cases that you

855
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,260
see here is like the tip of the iceberg

856
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,820
kind of a thing you can see the

857
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,940
potential growth rates it's about 10x

858
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,460
yeah right and this is where the

859
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,520
Sharpshooter thing comes uh yeah

860
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,658
so investigation

861
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,580
so they are making enough money here to

862
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,860
hire a sharpshooter from Chota saki gang

863
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,480
in order to give protection

864
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,360
right uh so this is no longer Netflix

865
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,220
Jam Tara this is basically on the path

866
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,899
of becoming narcos

867
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,580
in case you understand the implication

868
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,320
of how they were running right when

869
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,520
you're in when you're generating enough

870
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,620
money that you can hire a sharpshooter

871
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,140
for protection uh you are on a very

872
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,640
different scale of a criminal level

873
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,260
Enterprise that's really what you are up

874
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,080
to right uh

875
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,179
and the last one

876
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,960
dead bodies yeah so this entire scheme

877
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,700
was run on a person who died of Corona

878
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,440
so you would see the most valuable

879
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,299
identity in the market is that of a dead

880
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,980
body

881
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,340
right okay so now how do you fight this

882
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,899
fraud at scale

883
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,480
not many good answers

884
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,580
okay okay now what happened to this

885
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,100
okay

886
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,179
all right

887
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,600
uh so what is new uh like this is now

888
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
present-less uh pretty scalable you

889
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,039
don't really need to physically lift

890
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,200
Pockets from people you can just left it

891
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,159
from remote

892
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,740
uh it's trivial transaction costs to run

893
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,600
this Enterprise so profit margins in

894
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,240
ebitda are around 1995 98 percent

895
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,860
that you wouldn't even get in the

896
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,179
software business even Microsoft doesn't

897
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,820
have as a bitter margins yeah uh

898
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,380
difficulty in apprehension so you have

899
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,179
anonymizing Services people are pretty

900
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,820
pissed off uh particularly cops

901
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,860
with respect to non-massing Services it

902
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,620
just works very well against them uh

903
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,740
public access points uh they have done

904
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,500
enough uh stuff using the public Wi-Fi

905
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,480
and remember once you have SIM cards you

906
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,500
can do anything

907
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,719
a sheer number of users entities devices

908
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,820
low reporting industrialization of crime

909
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,239
then there is a jurisdictional admit Raj

910
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,580
there are some uh stuff that I I wish Mr

911
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,000
Sandra was here it's about uh state

912
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,859
boundaries

913
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,839
State boundaries you can't travel States

914
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,580
in order to investigate and so on and so

915
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,760
on so they exploit that quite bad and

916
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,699
cross-country uh there is thing about

917
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,739
mlat right they can't get good

918
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,418
information because of mlat and so on

919
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,879
and so on so every of those data sharing

920
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,679
is actually in a set for them so cops

921
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,899
usually struggle a lot so when you see

922
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,699
notifications from the government to do

923
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,639
a b c d remember this is the angle this

924
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,440
is not a different angle you may not

925
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,180
appreciate it I don't like some of them

926
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,740
but I understand why it is at least

927
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,359
coming a particularly anonymization

928
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,000
because they don't know how to do it uh

929
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,800
and legislated criminal behavior is the

930
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,880
second problem that they don't know how

931
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,520
to do well yeah scale of operations are

932
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,380
significantly expanded

933
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,200
uh serial crime is now replaced with

934
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
parallel Prime

935
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,920
asymmetric advantage to the attack or it

936
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,359
is basically scale of Economics working

937
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,940
against them yeah what is special about

938
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,160
cyber risk just remember

939
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,780
there are adversaries on the other side

940
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,839
they are now operating like a cartel uh

941
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,880
best practices are shared there are

942
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,740
support groups uh there are YouTube

943
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,599
channels there are telegram channels and

944
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,420
whatnot and whatnot this industry

945
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,359
actually uh does best practice sharing

946
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,280
better than software Engineers you

947
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,700
should see to believe it yeah

948
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,040
and there is absolutely no ego here

949
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,480
there is just too much of ego there is

950
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,300
money making as an Enterprise absolutely

951
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,000
ego less Enterprise

952
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,980
than you yeah increasing attack

953
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,960
frequency diminishing cause

954
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,180
pretty adaptive and dynamic so if you

955
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,280
look at the operational layer it changes

956
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,380
all the time and you can't figure it out

957
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,200
until you go down the uh and and have a

958
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,300
catalog of these things right

959
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,420
attribution challenges low crossbody

960
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,940
collaboration and uh the other problem

961
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,800
that I mentioned is 90 percent of the

962
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,260
total cost or attributable to indirect

963
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,300
factors so the true cost of cyber

964
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,920
attacks or this kind of financial Tech

965
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,680
frauds is very hard to estimate and only

966
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,960
comes over many many years so all you

967
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,000
see here on the hockey stick on your

968
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,700
individual platforms is basically the

969
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,020
tail risk coming after years of

970
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,599
investment by the other parties so I

971
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,160
don't think you can manage this on your

972
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,879
own yeah

973
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,859
so what is needed uh

974
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,599
you need a much more strategic way of

975
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,040
thinking about it just not a very

976
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,800
operational way of looking at it and

977
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,060
that starts with understanding the scope

978
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,740
of the problem do not live in denial

979
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,839
it's already too late yeah

980
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,820
build collective intelligence because if

981
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,619
the other side is catalyzing and you're

982
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,720
there on the path of doing a narcos type

983
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,760
of a thing there is no point trying to

984
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,440
come and say my company I will not share

985
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,640
data

986
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,200
etc etc because I don't think you can

987
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,420
fight this yeah Will collaboration

988
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,020
platforms innovate on standards uh

989
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,820
remember they do much better best

990
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,040
practice adoption than you right so

991
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,500
innovate on standards build analytics

992
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,020
capability and I just I often laugh

993
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,700
about it invest in law enforcement

994
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,920
capability because they're pretty behind

995
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,320
the curve so it is responsibility of

996
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,880
researchers to go and tell them and run

997
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,140
programs for them

998
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,640
probably we have to start an Institute

999
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,859
of fraud research or something so

1000
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,599
that's about it

1001
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,460
I am done

1002
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,960
please ask your questions for the

1003
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,380
remaining time

1004
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,599
so uh

1005
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,320
foreign

1006
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,660
have been able to do the study without

1007
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,900
haryana police and what happened was one

1008
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,520
of our co-authors is a serving police

1009
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,380
officer from the 2015 batch of the

1010
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,760
Indian Police Service

1011
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,460
the problem was guess the number of

1012
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,859
complaints that they received can

1013
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,780
anybody guess the percentage of how many

1014
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,599
of them convert into Firs because fir is

1015
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,040
the starting point for any criminal

1016
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,440
investigation forget about you know

1017
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,140
understanding the tech and the processes

1018
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,540
Etc can anybody guess what what is the

1019
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,460
percentage and we are talking about only

1020
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,560
one state and that also half the state

1021
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,839
because haryana at that time had only

1022
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,820
two cyber crime police stations one from

1023
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,740
Northern haryana and one for Southern

1024
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,619
haryana and this is based on data

1025
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:38,400
of about nine months data from the

1026
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,960
southern part of the haryana police

1027
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,520
station which is a dedicated server

1028
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,280
crime so any guesses what was the actual

1029
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,560
conversion

1030
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,079
less than one percent less than one

1031
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,800
actually it was less than 0.5 percent of

1032
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,780
the total number of complaints coming in

1033
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,180
so thousands and thousands of complaints

1034
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,119
coming in less than 0.5 percent they

1035
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,160
were able to convert into Fir and that

1036
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,680
was the starting point of our uh study

1037
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,560
and as we looked at data then Anand

1038
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,599
cleaned up the data we actually had

1039
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,940
police constables converting into Clean

1040
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,579
Machine readable Excel sheets which then

1041
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,339
Anand took and then he did and I did the

1042
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,440
interviewing part where I interviewed

1043
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,119
all the cyber crime investigators

1044
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,140
because you wanted to take an

1045
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,359
ethnographic approach to the study and

1046
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,820
understand then we spoke to people in

1047
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,859
the mha we spoke to Banks we spoke to

1048
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,619
fintechs and that's how a lot of this

1049
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,400
study came out and and uh what Anand was

1050
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,980
trying to say for example somebody using

1051
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,300
kyc details of Tamil Nadu takes a Sim

1052
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,599
is based out of jamtara in jharkhand and

1053
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,780
is targeting somebody in Delhi or NCR

1054
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,880
region so there are three or four

1055
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,460
jurisdictions and the police are going

1056
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,440
nuts trying to I mean besides the other

1057
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,359
challenges they have trying to figure

1058
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,579
out how to investigate that case because

1059
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,859
so many jurisdictions are involved and

1060
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,660
the worst part is because of technology

1061
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,240
and the fintechs are always how much of

1062
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,760
security how much of ease of use and

1063
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,300
that leads to a lot of gaps in the so

1064
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,700
that's what our study review so over to

1065
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,099
you for questions

1066
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:18,770
yeah hello

1067
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,040
[Applause]

1068
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,680
[Music]

1069
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,800
hello so uh you talked about the kind of

1070
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,260
frauds that are happening in fintech I'm

1071
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,420
sorry yeah right and you said that okay

1072
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,240
uh they are not very high skilled as of

1073
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,099
now they are doing like uh they'll call

1074
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,619
you ask for the aotp this send you an

1075
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,380
SMS but what I have seen personally I

1076
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,320
have analyzed multiple cases where we

1077
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,619
see this trend that they are actually uh

1078
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,619
have started uh getting highly technical

1079
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,380
we have analyzed multiple campaigns

1080
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,780
targeting the customers of prominent

1081
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,140
Indian Banks uh where they were actually

1082
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,540
pushing out Android malware and the

1083
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,240
malware was good it had the capability

1084
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,640
to put your phone on silent it had the

1085
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,800
capability to put your black in your

1086
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,900
screen and it had the capability to

1087
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,780
steal your otps and they were using the

1088
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,119
fear grade tactic to get you to install

1089
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,300
the APK now once you install the APK you

1090
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,880
have already given them the uh your

1091
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,040
credentials because you wanted the

1092
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,380
reward point the after the APK gets

1093
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,020
installed now the kind of data that the

1094
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,900
threat actors have these hackers have uh

1095
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,760
it gives them the capability to automate

1096
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,560
all their attacks so the way the malware

1097
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,540
works is uh the threat actor Will

1098
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,339
initiate the transaction using your

1099
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,980
credentials the malware will put your

1100
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,140
phone on silent at the same time it will

1101
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,300
blacken the screen you will receive the

1102
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,060
OTP transaction message the malware will

1103
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,520
steal the OTP send it to the command and

1104
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,500
control server and delete the all the

1105
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,300
transaction related messages and you

1106
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,160
will be never be able to even know until

1107
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,380
unless you go and get a mini statement

1108
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,780
or something so what I'm actually asking

1109
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,540
is is the law enforcement even capable

1110
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,119
of investigating these kind of cases as

1111
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,119
of now because the answer is no yeah

1112
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,880
because and remember as a sample set

1113
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,040
remember the study is based on 20 20 21

1114
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,680
for a very small thing and this was

1115
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,780
basically the beginning of that fraud

1116
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,720
cycle yeah and after the tdps have

1117
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,579
become pretty sophisticated uh many

1118
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,560
times cops are completely and totally

1119
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,060
clueless about what the heck just

1120
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,900
happened right and uh they don't have

1121
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,760
forensic capabilities they don't

1122
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,740
understand how to do it banks are not

1123
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,619
interested uh so if you look at the uh

1124
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,859
the fraud diagram I give you right uh

1125
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,359
somewhere along that one second

1126
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,460
this one

1127
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,160
uh 2021 onwards they started putting

1128
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,099
more and more money on more tdps so it's

1129
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,500
become rapidly industrialized it's no

1130
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,380
longer your normal jumper scanners the

1131
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,880
value chain in terms of attacks and

1132
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,260
sophistication has dramatically

1133
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,420
increased but we couldn't see it in the

1134
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,400
fars but we could see the general Trend

1135
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,740
uh by analyzing the complaints and

1136
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,119
remember the other data that we got

1137
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,760
right if you had gotten 100 complaints

1138
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,160
uh 200 complaints only one of them went

1139
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,960
into the far so this is basically an far

1140
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,720
data there's only so much a cop can do

1141
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,359
and uh there isn't much we can do to go

1142
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,800
figure out beyond the point so they

1143
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,060
could analyze what they could they

1144
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,220
picked up what they could and the other

1145
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,760
interesting thing I was told is that uh

1146
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,099
the customer may have lost the money but

1147
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,660
the bank may have refunded back the

1148
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,520
money in which case uh it wouldn't come

1149
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,700
back to them as an far uh so uh they

1150
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,560
wouldn't they would lose money but they

1151
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,960
would get back and the tdps are no one

1152
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,920
cares

1153
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,300
and I'll just go to the next person the

1154
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,760
next person and so on so I'm not at all

1155
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,220
surprised like I said this industry is

1156
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,440
when you're hiring Sharpshooters for

1157
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,900
protection you're already on the narcos

1158
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,240
path yeah you're no longer on the John

1159
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,220
Tara path of Netflix kind of you're

1160
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,079
already on the narcos path this is now

1161
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,819
professional industry which can hire

1162
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,640
Killers so just be aware of it the only

1163
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,400
difference here uh with this industry

1164
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,040
and narcos is that narcos is still not

1165
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,800
on technology uh while they are using

1166
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,079
technology narcos you will have to go on

1167
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,060
the streets to sell your drugs but if

1168
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,040
you put your products on amazon.com the

1169
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,540
world becomes your customer or the

1170
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,220
victim just an intervention did you read

1171
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,960
the latest skin article where a fintech

1172
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,819
Founder said we feel like running a drug

1173
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:31,680
industry

1174
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,079
please read the can article uh it

1175
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,579
basically talked about a fintech Founder

1176
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,380
it was there in the public Twitter feed

1177
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,940
the guy says that it looks like we're

1178
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,680
running a drug industry so he's not very

1179
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,660
far off yeah

1180
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,180
and the problem here is that no one

1181
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,000
actually knows so I can analyze that

1182
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,099
right but I'm not law enforcement I

1183
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,680
can't take action uh if I report it to

1184
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,900
law enforcement they don't know what

1185
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,420
action to take I'll give you uh one

1192
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,900
day-to-day life and search the name of

1193
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,640

1195
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,619
fake customer care numbers posted on

1196
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,960
Twitter no one knows what to do with

1197
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,460
those fake customer care numbers and

1198
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,619
they are present on the all those you

1199
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,900
can like it is also present on YouTube

1200
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,480
right

1201
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,819
yeah yeah

1202
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,800
so basically they are poisoning the

1203
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,060
search results

1204
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,640
a person searches for a I mean my father

1205
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,440
who is not technically adapted he'll

1206
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,720
search for a yeah because the SEO game

1207
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,880
is better than uh anyone else I've ever

1208
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,460
seen so it's sophisticated marketing as

1209
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,619
part of their uh investment budget

1210
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,740
yeah how much do you think telcos

1211
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,140
contribute to uh this problem I used to

1212
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,020
had uh infosec for a a fast growing

1213
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,540
fintech and there have been a lot of

1214
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,839
cases most of it can be attributed to

1215
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:10,200
the synthetic IDs through the mobile

1216
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,599
numbers cops have always told me kyc is

1217
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,460
broken

1218
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,339
and it has broken so badly that they

1219
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,140
don't want to speculate about it I mean

1220
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,560
the

1221
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,599
it's quite possible

1222
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,339
I mean I don't know enough to speculate

1223
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,380
it but at least the cops have told him

1224
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,560
when he interviewed it so in in one case

1225
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,700
we found

1226
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,119
talking about kyc somebody uses the

1227
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,819
Bank's address as his address and it was

1228
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:44,339
mandated it was cleared as legitimate

1229
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,160
kyc and the case was done so we found

1230
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,260
hundreds and hundreds of cases like that

1231
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,599
where all kinds of addresses somewhere a

1232
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,579
temple somewhere this and all were

1233
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:57,619
cleared as legitimate kycs

1234
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,619
there was one more interesting case uh I

1235
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,540
wish Mr Sandra was here it would be very

1236
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,599
specific about details uh many of the

1237
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,420
banks had signed with one OTP provider

1238
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,880
oh that was that was hilarious many of

1239
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,359
them yeah so so a based on some tip of

1240
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,660
gurgaon police intercepted a car and

1241
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,760
they found a group of people with

1242
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,619
hundreds of SIM cards and hundreds of

1243
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,300
phones Etc and they were like what is

1244
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,280
this guy doing and so many laptops Etc

1245
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,500
when they started investigating the case

1246
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,660
turned out that this was a gang working

1247
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,660
out of Delhi targeting fintech customers

1248
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,839
and one of them worked in a company that

1249
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,420
used to generate OTP and they used to

1250
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,160
they used to have a revenue of hundreds

1251
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,540
of crores

1252
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,700
and it providers very small number of

1253
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,560
people so what this guy was doing was

1254
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,200
they had been uh contracted by one of

1255
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,380
the major Banks to generate otps as soon

1256
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,180
as the OTP would generate this man

1257
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,099
because he had access to all this data

1258
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,500
would inform the other scamsters in his

1259
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,359
group and then they would start using

1260
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,280
citing that OTP call up the Target

1261
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,180
customer start asking them to uh you

1262
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,060
know install either a TeamViewer or

1263
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,040
something on the mobile phone and then

1264
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,800
start uh sucking out all the money from

1265
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,560
their account so this I mean all sorts

1266
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,319
of sophistication was being done both in

1267
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,760
terms of process and in terms of

1268
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,440
Technology we even had ethernet cables

1269
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,760
running into yeah that company

1270
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,440
so imagine running a fiber optic line

1271
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,900
into a company to seal otps I mean this

1272
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,640
is really what you're looking at not not

1273
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,400
some guy who calls and says please free

1274
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,280
that is like the operational part

1275
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,160
yeah thank you for the great talk before

1276
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,160
so uh my question was that uh recently

1277
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,079
we have seen a lot of banks issuing a

1278
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,000
lot of sms's warning people from not

1279
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,819
sending their otps to a lot of people so

1280
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,339
the first part of my question is would

1281
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:56,339
that actually work and secondly has it

1282
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,440
actually reduced any any thought at all

1283
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,540
in fact what the biggest problem that

1284
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,940
the police was facing was that nobody

1285
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,520
and especially if it's an OTP which is

1286
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,520
generated as an SMS that is a major

1287
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,020
point of failure in fact they were

1288
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,420
saying if the OTP could come on a voice

1289
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,359
call that would have lesser because once

1290
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,599
the OTP comes on the screen people just

1291
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:21,240
see the first part there is a message

1292
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,740
which also comes with it please don't

1293
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,079
share it nobody sees it and moment they

1294
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:27,300
see the OTP and somebody says have you

1295
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,760
received an OTP that itself is a major

1296
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,619
point of failure there was another

1297
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,480
interesting thing again we don't want to

1298
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,540
name Banks but this Bank allows your

1299
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,760
registered mobile number to be you used

1300
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,060
for logging into your account so these

1301
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,920
people bought hundreds and hundreds of

1302
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,500
phone numbers from various illegal

1303
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,020
vendors and they would keep entering the

1304
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,720
number on the bank's website if the

1305
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,220
number is not registered it would keep

1306
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,220
rejecting it moment it would say that it

1307
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,079
recognized a registered number it would

1308
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,119
say do you want to use forget password

1309
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,579
so that became an indication key this

1310
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,440
number is registered to that immediately

1311
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,900
they would do a profile check call up

1312
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,700
that customer and say I'm calling from

1313
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,099
this particular Bank we will be sending

1314
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:13,200
you this you have to do this Etc and

1315
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
suddenly the person has lost all their

1316
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,900
money

1317
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,599
innovate in stitching Services yeah so

1318
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,000
buy from one buy from one buy from one

1319
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,500
pretty good assemblers pretty good

1320
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,319
assemblers and it's not just a fintech

1321
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,920
issue it's a fintech issue it's a Law

1322
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,780
Enforcement issue it's a telecom issue

1323
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,260
so they have figured out many ways of

1324
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,319
how to exploit various processes or the

1325
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:40,079
tech or the processes in all these

1326
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,560
players and and npci which has some idea

1327
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,660
of how the money is getting inundated

1328
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,940
with more and more crpc 91 requests

1329
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,680
because then they're trying to catch up

1330
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,859
because Moment One money is taken into

1331
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:55,020
one wallet it is quickly passed through

1332
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,240
six or seven different other wallets at

1333
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,099
times even turned into gift certificates

1334
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,200
and then in cash right away and all this

1335
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,819
is happening within a matter of minutes

1336
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:05,339
by the time the police get and they

1337
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,260
reach the first point of where the money

1338
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,359
was transferred already weeks if not

1339
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,680
months have already passed through

1340
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,619
before 24 hours your money is split gone

1341
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:18,119
gone and you no one can keep up with it

1342
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,220
as a result the digital payments

1343
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,140
ecosystem they are not struggling

1344
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,940
because every time a customer is

1345
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,740
defrauded even the amounts may be low

1346
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,960
thirty thousand forty thousand but just

1347
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,660
one day we saw collectively the payments

1348
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,640
come up to collectively the defraud is

1349
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,079
something in the region of two cross

1350
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,599
three crores in a day so you'd spread

1351
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,780
that out from across agencies countries

1352
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,119
Etc it's a massive amount but nobody is

1353
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:44,579
because initially the complaint looks

1354
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:47,099
very small nobody is able to suss out

1355
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,920
what is the actual scale of this uh

1356
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,900
problem and and they're losing customers

1357
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,480
because once a person loses 40 000 from

1358
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,579
one digital payments wallet why would

1359
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,200
they want to Etc they would start going

1360
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,160
back to traditional methods a very

1361
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,319
interesting presentation thank you

1362
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,380
um sorry

1363
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,800
so I I'm kind of trying to think from a

1364
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,900
Defender perspective um

1365
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,720
uh so my my question is a two-part

1366
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,079
question one uh the core layer that

1367
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,540
you're talking about right telecoms and

1368
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,760
the banks right

1369
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,400
um so those are the only two places

1370
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,460
where you know everyone can attack okay

1371
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,500
and the second thing and the second

1372
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,599
thing is the attackers have some piece

1373
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,400
of information that belongs to you your

1374
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,140
phone number your patent card your radar

1375
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,240
number or whatever

1376
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,540
um separately uh government of India has

1377
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,880
also been building up a database where

1378
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,640
your radar is getting linked to your pad

1379
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,220
number your your phone number and all of

1380
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,599
it

1381
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,700
um can there be some kind of a

1382
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,400
centralized authentication mechanism or

1383
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,680
authorization mechanism where any

1384
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,540
request so for example if a fraudster

1385
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,000
takes your mobile number and says I want

1386
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,040
a replacement Sim

1387
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,599
um where you actually get an

1388
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:07,859
authorization from a centralized

1389
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:09,900
Authority that will probably be solving

1390
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,839
the problem of data sharing as well so

1391
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,119
I'm just wondering if if building a

1392
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,460
centralized you know authentication

1393
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,660
Authority

1394
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,180
which does that verification based on

1395
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,339
risk profiling or something human entity

1396
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:24,900
is a hard problem

1397
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,760
no I'm just wondering I mean I'm sure

1398
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,900
it's fine I'm just trying to tell you

1399
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,460
again and again humanity is a hard

1400
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,900
problem okay

1401
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,579
I mean if it were this simple to have

1402
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,819
built it

1403
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:36,839
sir

1404
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:37,860
I have a question

1405
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,800
[Music]

1406
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,960
so uh you know like we're saying uh it's

1407
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,079
very hard to trace these scammers I see

1408
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,480
you know cyber crime departments still

1409
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,059
they're using very secure OS Windows 7

1410
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,400
so

1411
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,740
uh you know like actually India I feel

1412
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,280
India became one of the most worst uh

1413
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,079
best payment Gateway solution you know

1414
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,300
like from the panipur resellers to

1415
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,280
unicorn companies they're using up

1416
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,440
payment gateways and uh this digital

1417
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,599
India is getting very quickly getting

1418
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,260
scaled and you know uh uh getting uh you

1419
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,240
know developed do you think uh the uh

1420
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,339
non-technical people are ready for this

1421
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,460
digital India you know only they are

1422
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,980
becoming the main targets for such scam

1423
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,780
attacks they cannot Target security

1424
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,660
researchers and you know Society people

1425
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,300
so do you rethink the security research

1426
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,619
is ready for this

1427
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,780
you know like I'll almost like even like

1428
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,740
you know when it comes to social

1429
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,140
engineering everyone is getting even the

1430
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,000
technical guys are not ready for

1431
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,680
it yeah so you're basically looking at

1432
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,980
the Cambrian explosion uh of the

1433
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,900
exercise yeah it's not just about the

1434
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,000
profession uh you know it's all about

1435
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,059
the like the general uh set of people of

1436
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:54,960
India

1437
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,480
or do you think government has something

1438
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,859
to do

1439
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:02,880
uh you know spreading Awareness on this

1440
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,099
you know

1441
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:08,460
yeah so uh one is that you know there

1442
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,559
needs to be a lot more communication and

1443
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,020
that there is a gap in communication

1444
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,839
plus people while they adapt through

1445
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,460
technology very fast they don't

1446
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,380
understand the risks behind behind their

1447
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,960
technology also

1448
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,700
part of this structure also needs

1449
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,319
deterrence deterrence comes from good

1450
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,300
investigation which will also lead to

1451
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,819
but there are so many gaps in our laws

1452
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:32,520
today like one major problem that we saw

1453
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,300
is the I.T act mandates that every cyber

1454
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,940
crime investigation under Section 66 or

1455
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,380
other sections of the IIT act

1456
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,020
immediately automatically must get have

1457
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,599
an inspector or above level officer to

1458
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,280
do the investigation now the problem is

1459
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,020
states are hard-pressed to have

1460
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,660
investigators and at the inspector and

1461
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,460
above level because their numbers get

1462
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,579
lesser and lesser and an inspector is a

1463
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,980
fairly senior rank because yes he or she

1464
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,020
has to manage the police station Etc and

1465
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,300
hundreds of administrative duties where

1466
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,040
do they have the time plus there is no

1467
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,160
dedicated cyber crime training given to

1468
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,900
any of them so they'll spend their life

1469
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,640
doing normal crime and suddenly get

1470
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,099
thrust into the cyber crime and the

1471
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:16,020
other problem is that the people who are

1472
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,700
now doing the actual investigations

1473
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,520
they're much lower in the hierarchy but

1474
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,680
they are larger in number and in some

1475
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,359
cases they don't even have laptops

1476
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,040
forget about having the ability to do

1477
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,079
digital forensics Etc yeah so because

1478
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,020
there is no deterrence more scamsters

1479
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,740
feel very happy to go ahead and continue

1480
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,380
yeah the government can do a lot right

1481
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,260
are they I don't know but yeah but still

1482
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,180
no harm to the PS like you know not

1483
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,800
everything can be converted to a fear

1484
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,599
they have important cases to deal

1485
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:56,220
[Music]

1486
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,160
solve this problem that you could learn

1487
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,020
from hello

1488
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,300
sorry so to repeat the question like I

1489
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,040
know this was targeted towards India as

1490
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,720
a talk but are there other countries

1491
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,700
with similar systems that have solved

1492
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,819
the problem or remediated it

1493
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,160
when you say other countries with

1494
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,319
similar problems tell me which other

1495
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,839
country has 1.3 billion people

1496
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:20,940
tell me which other country has the

1497
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,760
complexity that India has so it's very

1498
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,619
easy to say that other countries may

1499
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:28,200
have solved Etc but nobody understands

1500
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,319
the scale and the complexity of our

1501
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:35,220
systems so we'll have to create some we

1502
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,319
can learn from the others but some

1503
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,300
lessons Etc will also have to work

1504
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,819
within the context that we operate in

1505
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,440
and the challenge is the unique

1506
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,599
challenges that India has before we will

1507
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,160
be able to solve some of these issues

1508
00:57:49,819 --> 00:57:54,800
there's no other way to do it

1509
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,640
ourselves I don't think we can look out

1510
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,780
we can we could

1511
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,220
we can do best practice kind of figuring

1512
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,380
it out but

1513
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,359
the structural problems here are kind of

1514
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,160
unique so it is really a plus to figure

1515
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,619
out that part

1516
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,180
I know I know of companies which come

1517
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,400
and try to offer Solutions but moment

1518
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,440
they see the scale at which our

1519
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,300
government Etc has to work it's

1520
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,819
unmatched I mean it's very easy to blame

1521
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,319
the government easy very easy to blame

1522
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,000
authorities but we have seen from the

1523
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,660
inside the amount of uh scale of

1524
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,579
challenges that they face and it some of

1525
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,680
it is pretty heroic I mean our respect

1526
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,660
for law enforcement went up tremendously

1527
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,640
with the kind of stuff they pull off

1528
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,920
despite this channel actually as a as a

1529
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,380
province researcher I'd always knows it

1530
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,599
very well and I I was not a very fond

1531
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,359
person of law enforcement uh until I

1532
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,859
actually started getting involved with

1533
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:48,900
them on a day-to-day basis it's quite

1534
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,940
mind-blowing given the kind of resources

1535
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,260
and the problems they have they're even

1536
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,839
able to do whatever they can now is it

1537
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,859
sufficient as Citizens no uh so the job

1538
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,079
is for us to basically go figure out how

1539
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,880
to work around this problem because like

1540
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,500
I keep saying it's now hit Narco scale

1541
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,059
what I know waiting for

1542
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:12,299
uh the next is the guy sorry yeah

1543
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:15,119
sorry to interrupt but if anyone have a

1544
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,220
question you can come here and

1545
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,020
personally make to an answer because we

1546
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,059
are running late just one last question

1547
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:24,540
I have yeah sure uh and so this is one

1548
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,220
part of scam that is going on and we are

1549
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,960
aware of it finally there is another set

1550
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,619
of scam that is being run by another

1551
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,720
Associated it is usually you should be

1552
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,339
another country

1553
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,619
that they are running a set of loan

1554
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,780
applications they will give you a small

1555
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,880
certain set of loan with some certain

1556
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,380
documents you have to install the

1557
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,960
applications and the moment you do that

1558
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,540
you are into the Trap is government

1559
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,059
looking into it is something being done

1560
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:53,099
on that part

1561
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:54,720
you were mentioning the Chinese loan

1562
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,839
scams yeah yeah I mean so I had worked

1563
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,240
on that uh it's a pretty sophisticated

1564
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,980
operation no doubt and lot of the

1565
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,599
actions today you're seeing on digital

1566
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,500
lending guidelines came from that uh it

1567
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,000
is it is a problem that they are trying

1568
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,920
to do whatever they can uh that is the

1569
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,240
way in which I would see it it is

1570
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,400
slightly better than what it is in fact

1571
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,319
quite better than what it was at the

1572
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,260
peak of the 2021 uh but a lot more can

1573
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,700
be done there's no doubt that lot more

1574
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,559
can be done like some measures like at

1575
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,359
the central government level if you see

1576
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:26,160
under the ministry of Home Affairs

1577
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,960
they've created what is called the i4c

1578
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,059
so they are trying to attack one part of

1579
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,220
the problem under certain you have the

1580
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,720
Cyber Swatch games where they are trying

1581
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,280
to attack another part of the problem

1582
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,980
then at State levels now because they

1583
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,660
understand the jurisdictional issues

1584
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,240
many state police forces have created

1585
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,700
they always had cyber crime police

1586
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,579
stations and cyber crime units but now

1587
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:49,200
they have created specific like

1588
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,960
jharkhand has done this a dedicated dig

1589
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,140
level officer to coordinate with other

1590
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,240
state police forces who are coming to

1591
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,640
their state to handle or investigate

1592
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,380
such kind of crimes so at different

1593
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,640
different levels different different

1594
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,040
things are happening and we are also

1595
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,260
working on a solution because is now

1596
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,940
that we have understood a large part of

1597
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,260
this problem we are working on a

1598
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,240
solution that will hopefully maybe at

1599
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,799
the next nullcon talk we will be able to

1600
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,380
talk about it but the idea is that if

1601
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,720
you are able to understand what the

1602
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,780
problem is from their perspective which

1603
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,160
is you know people who are dealing with

1604
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,960
it on a day-to-day basis then you

1605
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,640
suddenly realize what is the complexity

1606
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,160
they are facing and then try and add our

1607
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,780
capacities that is our combined

1608
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,940
capacities to their efforts so that we

1609
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,819
can resolve this issue yeah but in this

1610
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:37,319
specific use case it is not the

1611
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,819
exploitation of human vulnerability

1612
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:41,460
because the person knows that he is

1613
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,920
going to you know engage with a nbfc

1614
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,020
kind of firm to borrow a small amount of

1615
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,599
loan and he knows that he is sharing OTP

1616
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,700
to get the or whatever you know to get

1617
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,500
the money in his account

1618
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,319
so there is no human training involved

1619
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,059
here because you cannot train someone to

1620
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:00,000
not take the loan right and these people

1621
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,799
who are running this scam they are

1622
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,660
running multiple set of the same set of

1623
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,180
code is being like morphed in a

1624
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,500
different format and they are launched

1625
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,319
as applications you can install it and

1626
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,839
then they'll uh ask for all the

1627
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,819
permissions basically

1628
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:17,819
your contact details files media

1629
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,160
multimedia so if you're running out of

1630
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,440
time what I would suggest is the the

1631
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,720
reporters on the website and as I said

1632
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,420
this is just a work in progress because

1633
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,460
this was done in a particular period so

1634
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,619
you can go to our website deep strat.in

1635
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,140
and you can study this and maybe we can

1636
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,180
carry forward this conversation sure

1637
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,079
yeah

1638
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:40,680
sure

1639
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,960
but thank you very much for having us

1640
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,960
and great to be back at nalco

1641
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,370
