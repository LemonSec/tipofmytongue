1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,000
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,099
um I am Aran prakash founder and CEO at

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,400
pinksafe we are a cloud security

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,700
platform backed by Sequoia uh some of I

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,460
started my ethical hacking journey in

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,960
2013 by finding a bug on Facebook

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
which they rewarded with 500 and then

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,580
subsequently made into top five

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,580
Whitehead hackers in Bounty programs of

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,640
Facebook Uber Twitter LinkedIn and

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Salesforce also made into forms under 30

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,079
list of Asia in 2017 in Enterprise Tech

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
category so in this talk we'll be

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,360
discussing some of my findings in these

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
major Bounty programs and the tricks

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,399
that have been used on finding these

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,020
vulnerabilities and how you can find

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,420
similar bugs when you do bug bounties

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
and then we'll be moving on to some of

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,860
the case studies in Cloud security

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,300
so first of all how many of us uh get

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,159
here a message request saying hack my

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,080
can you hack my girlfriend's account or

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,798
boyfriend's account

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,619
so this uh bug took me quite around one

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,720
one and a half month of time uh to

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,900
figure out uh so this was so if you go

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,119
to Tinder what do you see on the login

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,159
page you see like two options one is

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,560
login with Facebook then there is login

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,860
with OTP and

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,500
I as a bounty hunter I went on to the

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,040
site and saw that uh the OTP service is

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,799
powered by account kit which is uh which

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,079
is powered by also Facebook so both the

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,479
login login mechanisms were on Facebook

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
so for me to hack into your Facebook

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,460
into your Tinder account I have to

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,040
either compromise your Facebook account

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,579
first or account kit account first

41
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,640
so context I combined like two different

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,920
vulnerabilities to create a very high

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,619
impact bug I found first bug in account

44
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,500
kit login where I go to login with

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,420
account kit option enter my phone number

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,360
enter my OTP which has been sent to my

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,660
phone number and then I kind of uh enter

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,060
the access token which is supplied by

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,700
some other app on account kit and uh

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,340
interestingly

51
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,379
there was no client ID validation which

52
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,080
is like the most common bug in North 2.0

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,260
so but for me to compromise your account

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,940
I can't really get hold of your access

55
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,980
token right which is like a very long

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,620
string I can't really get hold of it so

57
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,379
to make it like more high impact bug I

58
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,660
went on to account kit dashboard account

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,780
kit had a dashboard account kit.com the

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,760
service is not active it has been

61
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,819
decommissioned by Facebook now I went on

62
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,540
to the dashboard uh looked at the UI and

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,220
uh

64
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,060
yeah

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,879
looked at the UI and there were only two

66
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
options you can stop some messages from

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,319
getting sent and you can ban apps for

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,599
login and stuff like that but then I

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,879
went on to the JS files some of the

70
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,160
JavaScript files figured out a hidden

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,200
endpoint which was meant for updating

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,280
phone number of a user uh maybe that was

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,260
being used for some internal purpose or

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,019
something like that and I kind of

75
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,819
figured that endpoint out from the JS

76
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,300
file and if you look at the API request

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,000
the updates Inc async phone slash

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,420
confirm APA call this was the exact API

79
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,480
call so in the update phone request I

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,700
kind of enter my phone number and OTP

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,980
will be sent to my number and then I

82
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,780
will also get a request code which which

83
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,440
is also belonging to my

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,500
OTP itself but interestingly what was

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,799
happening here is the new phone number

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,659
was missing validation so update

87
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,519
underscore request underscore code and

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,319
confirmation code were getting checked

89
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,299
but it was not really getting checked

90
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,280
with the new phone number where my

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
number was supposed to be entered so

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
basic simple validation bug figured out

93
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,640
in the hidden endpoint but now I could

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
compromise like any other account kit

95
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,560
account in the world so simply entering

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,299
your phone number I will have access I

97
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,280
will be directly logged in to your

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
account kit and I will have a cookie

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,298
named AKs uh AKs cookie supplied in uh

100
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,860
supplied by the account kit dashboard

101
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,639
and now I use that cookie to kind of use

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,820
that in tinder's API request which is

103
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,639
which have two parameters token ID was

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,979
not mandatory you simply enter the other

105
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,100
accounts token that you got and you will

106
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,660
be logged in into any account you could

107
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,780
read their chats and everything

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,340
so

109
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,699
like very basic bug combine multiple

110
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,259
bugs to create a high severity bug and

111
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,360
most of these times if you I I if we

112
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,160
report a very low severity bug company

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,860
say they argue that this is not a high

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,660
severity about critical severity debug

115
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,280
we'll put that in backlog for like six

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,259
months of time or something like that

117
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,720
and you would end up ignoring that so

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,639
it's kind of necessary to fix like low

119
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
severity bugs as well this is the

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,220
screenshot showing the AKs token

121
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,680
um

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,419
cookie which you can use like a master

123
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,080
token and any other company who was

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,120
using account kit was vulnerable to this

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,940
Reverb saw one every everyone was

126
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,400
vulnerable you could login into all the

127
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,900
other accounts as well so very high

128
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,560
impact work very high user impact uh due

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,160
to a security misconfiguration

130
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,860
final impact ability to take over any

131
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,080
Tinder account

132
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,580
even though I found found like two low

133
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,979
severity bugs but I combined them to

134
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,160
create a high impact bug and every

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,020
bounty hunter or blackhead hacker they

136
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,720
work in same way try to figure out uh

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,180
two-step three-step exploits to kind of

138
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,780
uh create large scale large-scale impact

139
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,559
to companies

140
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,979
moving on to Uber so this bug allowed me

141
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,759
to compromise any Uber or Uber driver

142
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,300
account Rider account uh very basic bug

143
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,800
so I kind of went on doing recon process

144
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,900
what we normally do figured out the

145
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,720
domain saying

146
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,539
bonjour.uber.com and it was a domain I

147
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,580
kind of tried looking out like what this

148
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,460
domain is really used for

149
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,259
then I by doing some Googling and stuff

150
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,419
I kind of got to know that this is used

151
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,860
to sign up drivers in U.S I kind of

152
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,020
entered a U.S number went on to the flow

153
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,300
and figured out an end point in the

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,319
figured out an end point uh in the same

155
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,759
flow and if you look at the request

156
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,699
there is a small request which basically

157
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,039
says RPC equal to get consent screen

158
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,800
details and there is a user uuid going

159
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,580
in so if I so bug was very simple I kind

160
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,699
of enter some other users uuid and then

161
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,460
I kind of see your extra information

162
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,080
which is leaked in the API so if you

163
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,880
look at the response of the API use can

164
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
see

165
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,759
yes sorry

166
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,919
you can see that there is a token

167
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,840
parameter which is being highlighted so

168
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,580
can you guess what this token parameter

169
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,699
is

170
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,080
any guesses this is a web application

171
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,060
can you guess what is the token

172
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,580
parameter

173
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,120
this is the mobile apps access token

174
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
so this is like Master access token if

175
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,380
you have logged in into your Uber app on

176
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,840
Rider as a rider or partner this is like

177
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,419
Master token you can call all the apis

178
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,639
all the apis which are being hit by the

179
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,740
mobile app and if you look at like other

180
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,539
extra data which is coming in the

181
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,060
request in the response is like sign up

182
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,180
latitude sign up longitude

183
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,199
but the problem is I can't get your Uber

184
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,560
uuid how do I get a random string

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,500
then I spent some more time I registered

186
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,080
myself as a driver my friend has had a

187
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,300
restaurant I onboarded him to the

188
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,460
restaurant tried figuring out another

189
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,180
low impact work had like 600 endpoints

190
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,220
tried looking out for a bug which would

191
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,759
leak Uber uses uh uuid

192
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,220
so this is the second bug very low

193
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,219
impact bug uh if you look at this

194
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,219
request this was in like the Uber when I

195
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,260
registered as a driver I found this

196
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,559
endpoint there and this request is like

197
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,880
you add driver

198
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,219
you enter any phone number country code

199
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,080
and similarly there is another request

200
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,180
where you enter email address

201
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,360
of any other user and the response would

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,640
be driver uuid not found

203
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,860
so even if you enter a rider or driver

204
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,019
phone number any number you would get

205
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,320
the uuid of another Uber user so think

206
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,360
of a case you entering my phone number

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,019
in this API call getting my Uber user

208
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,500
uuid and then you using the first bug to

209
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,420
kind of get my mobile app success token

210
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,459
and then you're seeing all my past write

211
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,160
history uh seeing my credit card details

212
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,779
you take you can take rights from my

213
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,820
Uber account everything so this was

214
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,600
impacting all Uber users and uh

215
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,459
then fixed

216
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,279
so even though initially I thought I

217
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,800
failed into get into Uber account when I

218
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,320
saw the uuid long random string if I

219
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,940
report it to a bounty program they would

220
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,640
say how how would you get the uuid of

221
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,080
other user

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,839
but I tried exploiting it figured out

223
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,760
multiple other endpoints to create a

224
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,279
very high impact work so as an attacker

225
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
we kind of do we try to get access to

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
apps like agent applications driver apps

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,560
restaurant apps and uh then kind of

228
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,100
figure out other second order

229
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,180
vulnerabilities to create a very high

230
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,880
impact bug try to create correlation if

231
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,620
you are in new if you are new into bug

232
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,200
bounties try to create correlations in

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,760
two different different apps and combine

234
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
multiple other vulnerabilities to create

235
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,599
a critical bug

236
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,420
Facebook

237
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,899
so this was very weird uh

238
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,899
uh this has not been disclosed yet till

239
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,760
date uh so this was in the main

240
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,459
main Facebook app I was testing main

241
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,640
Facebook app capturing the traffic in

242
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,980
main Facebook app they had access token

243
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,600
going into authorize all the requests

244
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
and that access token is basically used

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,880
to get your messages notification

246
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,940
whatever you do on the mobile app and uh

247
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,920
all of you must be aware about login

248
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,440
with Facebook functionality so when you

249
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,060
go to any third party site you go to

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,940
login with Facebook and um you kind of

251
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,220
do next next next and uh and kind of you

252
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,839
some some sometimes you see like

253
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,880
permissions being given to the other

254
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,800
third party app but what if you have

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,300
given the basic permission to a third

256
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,980
party app only access your email address

257
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,440
or user ID but still that third party

258
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,000
app is able to access your messages

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,279
notifications and everything of your

260
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,180
account

261
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,240
so this bug basically allowed any

262
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,680
third-party application if you have

263
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,420
authorized any third party application

264
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,180
in your Uber in your sorry in Facebook

265
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,820
account they if they obviously they will

266
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,440
have your access token in their database

267
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,420
right uh they would end up getting

268
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,760
access to your messages notifications

269
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,519
the entire Facebook app

270
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,680
this was the API called all the APA

271
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,060
calls were vulnerable this was one of

272
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,519
them this request is basically used to

273
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,100
fetch number of messages you can sell

274
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,440
change number of messages to thousand

275
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
nine hundred so any third party app

276
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,779
would have kind of used this endpoint

277
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,000
to get your X to get access to your

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,120
entire messages and other details order

279
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,700
history payment information whatever

280
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,720
apis were there

281
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,420
so an high impact billions of users out

282
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,200
there it had like any other app wherever

283
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,060
we use login with Facebook they would be

284
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,060
able to impact billions of Life which

285
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,100
are out there due to a simple uh

286
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,579
security misconfiguration and the

287
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,160
takeaway is mostly like when looking out

288
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,019
for bounties don't think some something

289
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,899
is very obvious I see most of the folks

290
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,720
trying with Recon first Recon process

291
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,560
first and then kind of go they kind of

292
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
hesitant to go into main application and

293
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,579
try to figure out bugs so you should

294
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,380
also focus on Main applications because

295
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,360
you will end up finding these weird bugs

296
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
sometimes

297
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,240
but impact of application security bugs

298
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,740
so we talked about some of the

299
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,920
application security bugs here uh

300
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
high impact bugs critical impact bugs

301
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
companies end up paying uh large Bounty

302
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,459
amounts for this as well but our data

303
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,100
breaches really prevented uh because of

304
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,240
this

305
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,760
so so I was doing like bug bounties from

306
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,519
these many years and then I realized uh

307
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,940
this so the impact is very high right if

308
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,700
you kind of find bugs in apis uh you

309
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,380
would end up accessing some user data

310
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,320
partial user data but Cloud related

311
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,959
issues you would end up compromising the

312
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,019
entire company itself in 2020 as per

313
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,920
hacker ones uh report there was a rising

314
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,740
12 000 to 86 percent uh in security

315
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,899
misconfigurations uh reported on the

316
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,860
platform

317
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,779
and the impact of cloud security

318
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,880
vulnerabilities because of the extent

319
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,519
because of exposure you would end up

320
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,079
compromising the entire cloud is like

321
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,160
very high

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
so

323
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,560
we'll come on to some of the cloud case

324
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,639
studies this one was an assessment which

325
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,700
we did for a company

326
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,339
we were obviously we had like subdomains

327
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,380
and everything we figured out an open

328
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,980
port Docker registry was open to uh

329
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,019
public

330
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,760
I could have downloaded

331
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,339
we downloaded the docker registry we had

332
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,680
permission to do that we downloaded the

333
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
registry uh

334
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,240
we pulled out all the images created

335
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,940
containers and then got access to the

336
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,040
application code and uh in the

337
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,779
application code uh this is like very

338
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,459
very common you companies end up hard

339
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,279
coding like secrets in the code right so

340
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
they had like AWS access key and uh

341
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,420
security hard-coded

342
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,980
then

343
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,100
like further steps we use those AWS

344
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,839
credentials to list down cloud formation

345
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
templates and in those cloud formation

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,100
templates they had jira slag

347
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,339
so you use GitHub token to kind of get

348
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,699
access to like all the repos that they

349
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,740
are you compromise slack you end up

350
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,420
compromising Zera and you know what

351
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,339
happens is when we go as Security

352
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,019
Professionals when we go to a company

353
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,540
and say that uh jiram everyone is having

354
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,639
like all access all projects access

355
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,920
restricted so what we found using that

356
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,980
Zera token is uh it had access to like

357
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,440
security project you could find like all

358
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,820
the books that have been filed in their

359
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,019
security project

360
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,339
so like from cloud ending up to SAS apps

361
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,100
which are out there and you understand

362
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,620
the impact right so how big the impact

363
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,680
is when a cloud uh when you're when

364
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,079
someone's cloud is compromised and this

365
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,720
is how most of the breaches happen we we

366
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,220
should solve for like these low hanging

367
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,959
fruits as well uh hard-coded Secrets

368
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,760
obviously opening a ports authentication

369
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,439
like basic basic uh stuff

370
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,860
this one was uh so how many lost money

371
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,339
over here

372
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,760
quite a few ends so this one was uh very

373
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,000
uh interesting we uh we kind of

374
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,519
publicized we published it uh yesterday

375
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,680
so Shiva you know one of their

376
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,079
developers

377
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,120
had put their AWS key on a public

378
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,500
Repository

379
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,440
so it had like all the permissions we

380
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,420
were able to get hold of the key within

381
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,839
like one minute of leakage and uh we did

382
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,820
some some smoke test obviously it's a

383
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,920
platform so you can't really go and

384
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,019
exploit things like when you do in

385
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,139
private engagements we were able to list

386
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,540
down ec2 instance it had permissions to

387
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,180
kind of create new ideas instance drop

388
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,459
RDS instances modify S3 buckets

389
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,720
everything

390
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,540
so like entire Cloud compromise of 6

391
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,959
billion market cap crypto coin and high

392
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,300
time it's like 5 500 million billions of

393
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,940
dollars being created uh daily so like

394
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,779
very basic bug uh

395
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,579
these were the keys

396
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,680
they removed the credentials yesterday

397
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,319
they created a new repository also to

398
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,799
make sure no one kind of figures it out

399
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,799
these were some of the some of the

400
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,380
screenshots uh to kind of list down the

401
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,299
ic2 instances

402
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,980
final impact

403
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,380
full key permission who would kind of

404
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,400
use keys and we were able to kind of

405
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,880
you you could do like extra steps but we

406
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
can't do really when you kind of uh do

407
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,100
in the Bounty programs they were

408
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,480
obviously they were not even having a

409
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,860
bounty program all developers were

410
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,480
Anonymous we tried reaching out our

411
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,240
Twitter telegram no response so we had

412
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
to publish this the key was deactivated

413
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,520
after uh two days of time

414
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,179
takeaways try harder if you are new to

415
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,200
bug Bounty uh persistence is the key

416
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,140
you have to be very persistent if I can

417
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,880
do it you can also do it anyone can do

418
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,660
it

419
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,360
ethics are like Corner Stone for Success

420
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,240
don't exploit a bug too much if you

421
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,100
don't have permission don't try to

422
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,919
extract uh

423
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,280
money from companies

424
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,820
for simple simple bugs go I started my

425
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,080
career as an application security

426
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,539
engineer then completely transitioned

427
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,260
onto a cloud security profession I I

428
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,360
still do like try to figure out these

429
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,340
bugs

430
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,260
but you can also start learning cloud

431
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,760
security very emerging area and last but

432
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,980
not the least

433
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,799
do not rely on tools too much don't be a

434
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,900
tool monkey try to learn what is

435
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,220
actually happen happening on the back

436
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,020
end obviously you can use tools to kind

437
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,559
of automate some of the tasks but but I

438
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,200
and other folks are also seeing is uh

439
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
Bounty and just trying multiple tools

440
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,500
getting few initial dollars but that

441
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,360
that won't last for like many many years

442
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,200
so you have to learn coding uh

443
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,660
infrastructure everything try things

444
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:07,020
combine multiple bugs and then do this

445
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,100
thank you

446
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,550
[Applause]
