1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,179
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,440
and firstly thanks for nalcon and for

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,639
having us here

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,880
uh it's a pleasure to moderate this

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,599
panel uh called Pam maturity from zero

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,240
trust to least privilege so the way we

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,000
have structured uh the discussion is we

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,939
will first start with the Pam then we'll

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,580
talk about zero trust and then slowly

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,619
we'll move towards uh least privilege

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,260
so my first question to let's say

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,660
charanji to you would be what is spam

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,180
for a CSO and

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,000
what have you used it for in let's say

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
your current or previous organizations

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,640
thank you Ajay yeah so very apt question

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,280
for today's session we start with the

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,440
privilege access management so as we

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,840
know privileges are the most important

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,460
access management criteria in an

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
organization and mostly these are kind

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,739
of the keys to the organization's core

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,400
security so these are being used mostly

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,240
by the system administrators

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,119
developers and key

26
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,460
operations people who are using it now

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,260
privileged access management is a key

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,619
thing for the business and this is one

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,080
of the core factors wherein cyber

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
security plays a key role here uh

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,280
privilege access management has to be

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,900
defined within the organization so

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,820
whenever it uh when you when you go for

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,280
it there is a change or cultural change

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,659
which is required within the

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,460
organization you need to have a

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,799
management buy-in and you need to

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,280
explain the approach the way the culture

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,520
will will differ

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,040
from from the from the point the

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,579
implementation starts rolling out so you

42
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,619
need to train your people the key people

43
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,200
who will be part of uh the Pam process

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,659
you need to ensure that they are fully

45
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,880
trained fully equipped they are

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,759
accustomed attuned uh Sops have to be

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
created because there are this is a very

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,380
big topic and a lot of things come into

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,080
the picture you need to cover the entire

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,540
IIT infrastructure landscape be it

51
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,280
on-prem on cloud hybrid environment

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,860
wherever you are you can cover the itot

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,680
part also now the devops kubernetes ETC

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,980
so all the paradigms of of the world are

55
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,560
in the emerging evolving cyber security

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,980
risks uh you can take care of using the

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,319
privileged access management as a

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,940
solution

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,540
thank you

60
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,980
you want to add something to it

61
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,540
yeah that's a very

62
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,200
um

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,080
uh interesting point which I want to uh

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,660
say before I answer the question

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,840
uh Verizon so data breach report says

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,940
that uh

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,680
of all the credentials which has been

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
compromised 61 percent equations were

69
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
privileged credentials

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,760
I mean that's a whopping number because

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,580
we have seen there's another report from

72
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,060
checkpoint which says that the attack on

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,300
the corporate networks the last year is

74
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,780
50 more than the previous year

75
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,099
so that brings me to the point maybe I

76
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,480
will ask a question to the audience

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,040
Maybe

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,260
uh

79
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,360
how many of you actually use Spam in

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,019
your organization

81
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,360
okay roughly around to 20 percent okay

82
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,159
so I'll tell you why I asked this

83
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,480
question because

84
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,560
um

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,260
Pam is a privileged access management

86
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,659
solution is like your black box only

87
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,099
thing is it doesn't comes in orange

88
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,060
color oh yes uh you see our Black Box

89
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,580
because people focus on your perimeter

90
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,860
people focus on your end point

91
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,720
but what happens to access to your

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,239
servers which is being talked to webpam

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
so to answer your question yes it's a

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,319
very crucial component for the

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,120
organization it's a very crucial thing

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,900
that needs to be managed and one of the

97
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,760
uh interesting topics that's one of the

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,099
reasons why I agree to you know even to

99
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,320
participate in this because I have not

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,540
seen any of the conferences uh somebody

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,579
talking about a privileged access

102
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,860
management and zero trust security I

103
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,240
don't know whether any of you have heard

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,520
about it so that's one of a very unique

105
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,699
topic and very important topic which uh

106
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,259
you know I would like to share my

107
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,600
experiences with charanjit well and from

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,280
a product point of view from Ajay also

109
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,419
that's my answer sir

110
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,479
so uh very interesting points raised by

111
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
charanjit and Bala one uh the number of

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
data breach reports that you see here

113
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,240
all kinds of breaches like you mentioned

114
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,240
some Reports say 61 some Reports say uh

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,479
74 some Reports say 80 but if you see

116
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,139
the number one uh um you know I would

117
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,419
say parameter due to which these

118
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,580
breaches happen is the privilege access

119
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,960
and privileges

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,000
so yes definitely important and then

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,620
there's a lot of aspects that you can

122
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,960
definitely cover so uh I want to move on

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,780
to the zero trust part so how does spam

124
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,780
address the zero trust model we talk

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,460
about the zero trust model so does spam

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,780
address the zero trust model and how

127
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,340
does it do it

128
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,940
definitely yeah so zero trust is the

129
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,419
core I will say uh wherein the Pam is

130
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,600
focusing on so zero trust means uh don't

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,919
trust anyone

132
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,979
blindly so there is no trust for

133
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,199
everyone anywhere anyone who is trying

134
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,900
to access this kind of solution so

135
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,120
person who is trying to access it first

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
need to prove his authenticity whether

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,620
he's a genuine user and whether he has

138
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
been granted privileges or not and that

139
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,560
can be done using multiple ways now

140
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,660
there are risk based approach which are

141
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,300
coming in so which which take care of

142
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,580
not only the identities which are

143
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,680
getting authenticated but also the

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,539
device through which uh the user is

145
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,600
making a connection or a session uh for

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,820
how much time the session is being done

147
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
those things are being logged recorded

148
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,280
reported all change management process

149
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,520
are being followed in in case of any

150
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,440
suspicious thing or if you have set

151
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,319
anything on the organization policy like

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,680
uh something like antivirus updates or

153
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,199
patches if they are not missing which is

154
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,060
forming a baseline for the organization

155
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,120
policy in that case it actually it will

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,819
raise an anomaly and it will come into

157
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,280
the picture and based on the process

158
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
which is being defined either you allow

159
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,380
it you deny it or you isolate that

160
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,819
particular system or the user for the

161
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,979
time being this happens so this is the

162
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,720
complete overview of the zero trust

163
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
architecture uh on which a Pam is

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,560
working nowadays

165
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,020
so uh my take of uh you know on this

166
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,580
particular topic is slightly even more

167
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,759
grounded because

168
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,600
we are merging two different uh

169
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,880
complex

170
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
things here one is a privileged access

171
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
management then we are talking about

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,740
zero trust

173
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,680
so typically you know I look at things

174
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,199
at visibility control and monitor you

175
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,120
know first I need to have visibility I

176
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,720
need to uh then deploy the controls then

177
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,460
I need to continuously monitor so that

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,400
part of it is my typical operations but

179
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,680
when I come to zero trust you know it

180
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,300
talks about the device it talks about

181
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,580
the person it talks about the the

182
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,639
resource the application the port number

183
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,840
these kind of things

184
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,639
so if I'm going to do a three by three

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,639
Matrix and see what is that and how much

186
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,340
I have to score it has to be a checkbox

187
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,240
in all these nine boxes and uh I need to

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
you know have visibility control and

189
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,800
monitor plus I need to look at the

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
device I need to look at the people and

191
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,400
you also need to look at the results

192
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,680
which the person is going to look into

193
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,819
it

194
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,759
zero trust is a concept I mean how uh

195
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,800
things are going to be defined how

196
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,060
things are going to be addressed in an

197
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,240
organization depends on how much of

198
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,099
other solution they already have to

199
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,360
complement this

200
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,099
so just because you're going to have a

201
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,660
Pam is not going to ensure that you're

202
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,300
going to escape or avoid any kind of an

203
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,340
attack because there are prerequisites

204
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,300
for a Pam to be done so while these are

205
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
Concepts there are prerequisites and

206
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,120
there are approaches strategies to be

207
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,599
implemented uh you know effectively for

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,339
any solution to work in this case it's a

209
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,060
Pam so definitely there's a as Saran was

210
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,700
rightly mentioning there he the

211
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,220
environment the their dependencies if

212
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,500
these are going to be captured if we

213
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,380
know uh you know very simple for us ISO

214
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,420
it's a it's a sum of risk and sum of

215
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,700
controls right that's what we look at so

216
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,920
it is not one risk or one individual

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
control is going to protect the

218
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,160
organization it's going to be the sum of

219
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,040
risk and the sum of control so Pam plays

220
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,360
a very important role and definitely

221
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
with zero trust I think that will be a

222
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
killer combination

223
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,160
great so uh yes Pam plays a very

224
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,440
integral role in implementing zero trust

225
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,260
we heard you right but I also want to

226
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,779
take a key from what chiranjit mentioned

227
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,440
uh the approach for a plan so

228
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,899
classically when we talk Pam we talk

229
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,899
about the access controls right so we

230
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,660
usually say Okay

231
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,160
compliance people do it mostly for

232
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,200
compliance so maybe I want to take this

233
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,560
question uh forward saying Pam on a

234
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,200
compliance based approach or a Pam on a

235
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,720
risk-based approach so this time I would

236
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,660
like to start from Yo Bala how would you

237
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,580
differentiate you being from the

238
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,080
services sector how would you

239
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,360
differentiate the two and then we will

240
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
come to uh charanjit from a

241
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
manufacturing sector how would he

242
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,860
differentiate it

243
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,260
well this is going to be a big one

244
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,120
because

245
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,180
uh you know uh

246
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,160
I come from a function called risk and

247
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,200
compliance right I mean compliance is

248
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
also important risk is also important I

249
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
can't ignore what the piece is but uh

250
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,860
today

251
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,220
the approach or the thinking uh while

252
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,260
compliance is important

253
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,320
compliance alone is not going to uh take

254
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,580
care of certain things in the previous

255
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,000
session uh when budgies were there uh

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,940
there was a question that you know if

257
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm going to comply with these things is

258
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,899
that okay I mean it's just a tick in the

259
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,300
check box I mean if RBA give is going to

260
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,700
give you an uh mandate that all your

261
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,399
bfsi should have a Pam everybody will

262
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,800
Implement Pam that's it but how is it

263
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,920
going to reduce your risk

264
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
from a compliance risk point of view

265
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
budget will be approved

266
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,800
today the biggest problem in my opinion

267
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
what we are also facing with our

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,240
customer when we talk to them is a tick

269
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,880
in the box and more times we have to

270
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,600
educate them we have to tell them that

271
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,519
the concept of

272
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,380
do not focus more on the compliance

273
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,200
piece because compliance yes it will

274
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,360
take you there but sustenance is your

275
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,019
risk but you have a Pam yes it's a tick

276
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,360
but tomorrow will the Pam is going to

277
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,940
identify risk in your environment which

278
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,880
is going to be playing a very pivotal

279
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,279
role in for you to reduce your risk

280
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,060
exposure and improve your uh you know

281
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,380
resiliency

282
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,360
I think

283
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
more from the Caesar's point of view it

284
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,740
could be from a risk management yes it's

285
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,140
very important but I think uh this

286
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,899
platform I mean uh one of the other

287
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,820
reason uh which I love to talk about

288
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,100
this topic is because nullcon is more

289
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,279
technical uh and it's the analyst people

290
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,260
who are sitting out the engineers who

291
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,180
are sitting there they need to have the

292
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,920
business context of the risk what are

293
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,440
the spam used for where it is going is

294
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,180
it uplift I mean you can't write an sop

295
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,040
for common sense it's very difficult so

296
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,140
the risk is very important and they are

297
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,820
the guys who actually know what is

298
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,800
deviating the ciso doesn't know

299
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,820
risk management

300
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,160
these are the technical guys who have to

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,140
identify that with the business

302
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,959
knowledge so I think both who are hand

303
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
in hand but compliance is a mandate but

304
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,420
risk is something which is driven as an

305
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,820
as a culture if that is going to happen

306
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,399
then I think the value what you get out

307
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,100
of the initiative or the strategy is

308
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,260
going to be phenomenal I mean that's my

309
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,600
take on it

310
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,500
from you

311
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,160
yeah so typically compliance mostly all

312
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,100
the organizations are doing at their end

313
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,760
and either it is due to internal

314
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,200
requirement from the board or from the

315
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,959
external bodies whatever it is but it is

316
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,240
a common unilateral thing which all

317
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,200
organizations will do from a risk-faced

318
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,019
approach when we talk about it it

319
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,079
provides another flavor of the typical

320
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,540
risks which are actually evolving around

321
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,820
the organization now what are those

322
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,639
risks those risks will be both internal

323
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,040
and external risk now you need to

324
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,899
categorize those risks how will you

325
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,940
categorize those risks with the help of

326
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,279
a solution like a Pam it will provide

327
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,200
you a full discovery of all your

328
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,820
critical infrastructure which is there

329
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,579
then you need to identify which ones are

330
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,040
the higher risk item for you which are

331
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,600
the critical infrastructure which are

332
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,160
the medium ones and which were the lower

333
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,920
ones and accordingly you will uh you

334
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,820
will like to have the toll Gates uh or

335
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,740
the barriers uh so the level of

336
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,560
difficulty will increase from low medium

337
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,860
to high that's how I visualize that risk

338
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,500
so uh typically it is very easier to

339
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,360
explain such kind of thing to the

340
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
management or board when you say that

341
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,920
you're actually applying the risk which

342
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
is dynamically evolving within the

343
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,480
organization as well as outside the

344
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,279
organization and you are taking

345
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,100
proactive approach uh with the help of a

346
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,910
Pam solution

347
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,459
[Music]

348
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,980
it just struck me I think I need to tell

349
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,560
this also uh uh I'm sure uh you know uh

350
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,660
people will say you have to do threat

351
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,139
hunting identify anomalies uh you know

352
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,279
how many of you actually identified

353
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,000
anomalies

354
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm surprised because you can't identify

355
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,920
anomalies just like that

356
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,660
because you have to be constantly

357
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,399
monitoring you need to know a pattern

358
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,420
right

359
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,060
so you don't know what is Shifting so we

360
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,440
were just discussing and this came up

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,079
and uh when Sharon brought it out I

362
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,060
thought I should say this because

363
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,600
I keep telling that the the security

364
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,260
Community create patterns

365
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,720
if you don't create patterns saying that

366
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,360
for example you will do a change in the

367
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,579
active directory only on say Tuesday is

368
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,560
between 9 and 10 pm

369
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,839
so anything changes

370
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,519
you don't have to identify an anomaly

371
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,680
you don't have to uh you know wait for

372
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,899
the sock team to race and ticket then

373
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,639
resolve a group getting into it then

374
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,860
assigning it to it you don't have to

375
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,959
wait the moment it's going to be on a

376
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,779
Monday you know for sure it's a P1

377
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,699
why because it did not happen on a

378
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,500
Tuesday simple

379
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,079
create patterns if you don't create

380
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,660
patterns anything that deviate from the

381
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,940
pattern then you can classify that as

382
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,760
anomalies if you you can't see just a

383
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,339
blip and see that that's an anomaly no

384
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,620
that's not an anomaly there could be so

385
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,180
many reasons why something could have

386
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,399
blipped so many reasons why something

387
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,279
could be shown as a blip so when Sharon

388
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,420
said that it just occurred to me I

389
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,440
thought I'll just share that information

390
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,060
with you

391
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,199
okay

392
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,500
this brings me to our next question

393
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,779
which is you know election capabilities

394
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,420
but then before that let's define or

395
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,220
let's understand what Pam typically is

396
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,019
used for or known for so we all probably

397
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,019
agree that Pam is used for our

398
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,820
credential vaulting right so we do

399
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,980
credential vaulting into the Pam uh

400
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,459
p2mfa for the users who log in

401
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,540
passwordless or not knowing the

402
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,040
passwords they can log into the various

403
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,399
assets uh devices per se we do session

404
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,199
monitoring session recording compliance

405
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,260
aspects and then like we talked right

406
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,060
now risk-based approach where we are

407
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,940
talking certain risk analysis Behavior

408
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,339
Analysis these are aspects that you

409
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,540
expect or we know Pam today uh delivers

410
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,639
okay now let's talk about what are the

411
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,590
next gen capabilities or

412
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,779
[Music]

413
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,079
um Next Level capabilities

414
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,420
U.S practitioners or csos

415
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,480
you uh you would look for in a bank next

416
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,339
year

417
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,860
yeah so some of the new things which I

418
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,380
would like to see is uh how well it

419
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,020
integrates with the evolving Cloud risk

420
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,000
because now most of the organizations

421
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,619
are moving to the cloud

422
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,900
when we talk about the cloud we have

423
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,040
different platform like IIs pass SAS uh

424
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,339
definitely SAS will go out of frame for

425
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,520
the time being but is and pass major

426
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,099
thing kubernetes is coming microservices

427
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,900
is coming how do you address those

428
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,000
challenges it

429
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,480
OT scada lot of Machinery medical things

430
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,020
now happening and believe me in those

431
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,580
industry in medical industry or

432
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,260
manufacturing you don't have to be

433
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,760
worried about it because there were so

434
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
many people so much of talent available

435
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,840
they will take care of now I'm trying to

436
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,120
address my problem also

437
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,360
uh so uh so these medical medical people

438
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
or the manufacturing industry I mean

439
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,320
they require a very very simple Vision

440
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,320
what is actually happening and how to

441
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,020
address it at a click of a button can

442
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,320
that happen will that integration happen

443
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,140
will you simplify the lives of the I.T

444
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,600
people as simple as that so that is I

445
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,700
think that take away from the industry

446
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,600
is as of now

447
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,000
you just can you just simplified it too

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,620
much

449
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,679
so the the the uh

450
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,080
the ask is too much because what happens

451
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,880
is uh

452
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,020
today it's not more uh on the fam and as

453
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,660
I told you it's a black box right so uh

454
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,640
that's the last Source where we have to

455
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,580
get all the information and if I don't

456
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,919
find what I want

457
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,559
then it's a dead end for me

458
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,299
if I don't get in the pump then I don't

459
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,679
know where from I'll get certain things

460
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,480
because things could be overwritten

461
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,220
things could be wiped off I don't know

462
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,740
so very crucial information is what

463
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,960
happened when who accessed it what did

464
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,720
they do and everything so it's an it's

465
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,679
an evolution what uh the Pam as a

466
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,960
technology as well as a solution it has

467
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,860
evolved if I look at uh all these years

468
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,960
uh you know it started off as a password

469
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,280
Repository

470
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,100
right way back I mean 15 years back

471
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,799
whatever it is then you started looking

472
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,840
at role-based access management

473
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,940
then slowly devolve into multiple things

474
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,059
and uh today when we are looking at

475
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,460
Nixon requirements and we are talking

476
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,940
about uh uh you know zero trust and so

477
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,340
many uh complexities

478
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,980
the learning curve is very

479
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,179
Steep and one of the earlier sessions we

480
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,760
had the question you know how fast you

481
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,299
know how Hands-On should be the csob to

482
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,760
you know get into every technology

483
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,679
uh while

484
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,280
Pam is one of the most important things

485
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,380
any additional features you bring into

486
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,840
to the CSO to the security Community

487
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,940
who's going to manage and has got the

488
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,320
responsibility to safeguard the

489
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,260
organization it's a big thing because if

490
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,020
you're going to bring in uh the commands

491
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,720
that cannot be executed or we are

492
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,240
talking about uh zero trust privileges

493
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600
there or a time-based uh you know kind

494
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
of commands which is being executed you

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,220
know I will execute I will uh even

496
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,900
though Bala has got access to a

497
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,360
particular server and privileges but can

498
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,179
he run a Wipeout command on an active

499
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,160
directory he cannot

500
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,500
but earlier solution provided that kind

501
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,179
of thing because I checking their role

502
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,419
but today it has to evolve to how much

503
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,880
is enough I think our seizures will

504
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
never be happy with whatever you hear

505
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,559
they will always ask more and more so

506
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,539
there's no end to it but yes there is a

507
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,460
lot of room for it because it has to

508
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,960
work hand in hand with other Solutions

509
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,760
also how much I can do Integrations

510
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,919
everything so there's a lot on the table

511
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,299
I want to run this question with the

512
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,740
audience as well because we have a lot

513
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,900
of cyber security practitioners quite a

514
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
few people you mentioned you have you

515
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,220
have been using Pam so uh if we could

516
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,200
run a question here if anybody wants to

517
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,539
uh mention what are the next gen

518
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,240
capabilities or sets that they are

519
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,080
looking for in the family

520
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,980
but while they while they're going to

521
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,320
answer anything from a product

522
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,640
standpoint what do you think

523
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,960
[Music]

524
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,120
the product Community I mean from your

525
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,820
point of view what is that uh you think

526
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,600
you should bring there

527
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,039
well actually to be honest from the

528
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,539
product side of uh whatever I have seen

529
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,580
whether it is our product or some other

530
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,460
products quite a few of these

531
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,760
are even today handled right from the OT

532
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,159
side of business so integration with OT

533
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,520
yes Pam can do today Pam can manage op

534
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,280
side of business as well Pam can also do

535
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,220
containers Pam can also do you said

536
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,260
cloud and you said oh let's excuse the

537
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,140
SAS no need to excuse the SAS uh we Pam

538
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,720
can manage the SAS applications also

539
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,240
very much even today you mentioned

540
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,120
containers yes containerization yes very

541
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,340
much possible application to application

542
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,500
uh communication or key management right

543
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,320
we today do more from uh you know what

544
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
we know that the likes of AWS Azure gcp

545
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
they have their own key management stuff

546
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,400
but then the challenge added there is if

547
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,020
you have built an application for Azure

548
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,059
and you use the key management in Azure

549
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,280
if you port the application to AWS it

550
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,840
wouldn't work because you're using that

551
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,400
native camera and you have to rewrite

552
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,500
all over again so yes we have

553
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,539
centralized or Tam can provide you the

554
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,220
centralized Key Management capability so

555
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,900
irrespective whether you deploy the

556
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,840
application in Azure or AWS it works

557
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,900
absolutely no problem it can also do

558
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,760
ephemeral access if we understand

559
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,799
ephemeral axis which is like the

560
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,620
tokenization so one time single time use

561
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,500
tokens uh that's available today as well

562
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,140
I think all of these are right available

563
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,419
with any kind of Pam solutions that you

564
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,659
see in the industry so uh while some of

565
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,280
you if you want to answer this question

566
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,580
maybe uh you also

567
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,799
tell if some of these things you have

568
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,080
used or would I like to use or would

569
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,159
like to see

570
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,840
the answers to the audience

571
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,880
yeah on the product side

572
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,960
um one observation that we have is

573
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,400
off-boarding right so everybody does

574
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,220
onboarding Seamless right

575
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,520
the main the real world that that when

576
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,980
you go off-boarding that has to be

577
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,260
improved a lot because that's when the

578
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,020
you know number one question from a sisu

579
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,120
always he will ask what about off body

580
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,700
so from a product standpoint yes I think

581
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,620
uh these products handle offboarding

582
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,960
very well typically they integrate with

583
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,240
your directory services so if you are

584
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,460
using a user from your directory you

585
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,320
remove the user from the directory the

586
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
next second he wouldn't be having access

587
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,120
to any of these devices servers whatever

588
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,480
yeah um just a real challenge right so

589
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,780
privacy comes in now the moment you know

590
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,240
the moment we do our boarding the

591
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,860
footprints are everywhere

592
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,080
and that area is not well seamlessly

593
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,059
integrated so you can upload in the

594
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,159
active directory what happens the

595
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,559
footprint that is spreading across

596
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,659
application and then the Privacy kicks

597
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,520
in and like now you offload it on the

598
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,100
active directory you can't track where

599
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,080
the data is you know seated everywhere

600
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,020
because you lost the the primary key

601
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,000
kind of logic right and and that's when

602
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,179
the interrupt in across the board is

603
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,640
important

604
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
so uh

605
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
well we can discuss in detail offline

606
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,000
but yes products today whatever I know

607
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
of maybe not all products but yes

608
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,419
products today are capable of

609
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,120
offboarding across the

610
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,220
technology platform that we can add to

611
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,419
that so one of the uh problems today uh

612
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,000
people face is your application

613
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,659
dependency mapping right so today Bala

614
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:13,919
is there he accesses a particular

615
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,900
application Bala leaves the company

616
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,500
Sharon joins it he is assist

617
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,360
joins then accesses

618
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,120
and if you go back to the audit records

619
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,520
you will see Balaji run energy but the

620
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,919
question is if the fourth person comes

621
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,080
will he know what access Ajay is

622
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,460
supposed to have

623
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,580
and is he what is that what he is having

624
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,580
that is something no solution the world

625
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,559
can give you on the platter

626
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,720
that depends on your governance

627
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,460
so what happens is

628
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,760
in your review in your governance

629
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,880
how many times some people have accessed

630
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,640
why they have accessed because for every

631
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,799
access yes obviously you need a change

632
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,200
which has been approved right so that is

633
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,539
one thing so when we are looking at the

634
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,400
chain and then we decide that okay now

635
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,020
Bala can continue to have the same

636
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,720
access Charan I don't see you're not

637
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,279
accessing this for more than three

638
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,500
months so I think we revoke your

639
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,200
credentials so this operating is

640
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,220
something

641
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,140
which is a

642
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,539
today which is managing Excel sheets

643
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,419
right so where we map and we we take it

644
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,700
up but there are solutions which I mean

645
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,860
next gen Pam which are bringing out the

646
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,620
dependency mapping also where you are

647
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,539
able to see that this is what it is and

648
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,640
you know that this person had access to

649
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,799
this therefore I need to revoke there

650
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,039
also so that is obviously that's one of

651
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,360
the things which is coming up and

652
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,580
feedbacks like this are very important

653
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,919
I mean the more the feedbacks comes in

654
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,279
then inputs goes into the OEM and then

655
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,200
they look into it and they give a

656
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,380
they make an upgrade or feature Google

657
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,000
I hope I answered your question that

658
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that's already there I agree yeah yeah

659
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,720
anyone else

660
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,080
[Music]

661
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,400
I have a question uh how uh mature are

662
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
we for the role changes within the Pam

663
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,980
products that we have like within com

664
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,620
organization role changes are we mature

665
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,659
enough in the products that we are able

666
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,640
to handle that

667
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,580
very much yes meaning roles are mapped

668
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,000
to their profiles and roles will have

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,539
mapping to access so very easy not just

670
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,159
Spam I think even identity access

671
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,620
management tools access management tools

672
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,940
also have those kinds of capabilities

673
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,059
meaning their privileges inside those

674
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,919
applications can also be changed based

675
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,419
on rule change because people will

676
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,159
obviously move up the ladder and

677
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,159
obviously their privileges will increase

678
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,240
inside

679
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,580
a classic requirement of typical Erp is

680
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,260
and all that stuff here thank you very

681
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,220
much

682
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,860
and it is not only limited to just the

683
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,980
roles because the it is now bringing

684
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,620
more glamor granularity into the task

685
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,779
earlier it was a role a role used to

686
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,700
have say 15 tasks

687
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,039
if I assign you the role you are

688
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,559
privileged to execute all the 15 tasks

689
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,000
but today

690
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,279
with the same role for you versus the J

691
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,039
I can give you four tasks in that and I

692
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,200
can assign him eight tasks for it so

693
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,000
that's a kind of granularity control

694
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,140
which we can bring in today

695
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,840
okay now let's move towards the uh

696
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,760
privileged side of it or release

697
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,200
privilege that we want to talk about but

698
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,400
before that let's try and understand

699
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,220
meaning we talked about Pam and whatever

700
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,200
capabilities earlier we talked about

701
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,720
most of them revolve around the access

702
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,220
part of it but once the access is there

703
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,740
uh then it is the Privileges which are

704
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,500
predefined right so we say privileged

705
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
accounts are always on and always

706
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,640
available right because accounts have

707
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,260
been defined accounts were defined

708
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,000
earlier in that so accounts are always

709
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,740
on always available

710
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,400
so uh do you agree with this aspect and

711
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,779
what risk does this bring

712
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,380
yeah so

713
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,220
giving default access to a person and

714
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,100
not monitoring his activities uh may

715
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,559
lead to Serious incidents that's what I

716
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,279
will say on a practical approach uh I

717
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,899
definitely do not agree with that and

718
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,200
the best thing is that even if you are

719
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,580
giving the access to your system

720
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,820
administrators on a privileged

721
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,919
infrastructure uh you need to ensure

722
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,640
some baseline access has to be given the

723
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,640
minimum bare minimum access which that

724
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,740
person

725
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,440
can do fulfill his daily operational

726
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,779
activities that is of number one

727
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,419
criteria after that if there are any

728
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,220
additional privileges as Bala was

729
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,980
mentioning on the fine-grained

730
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,960
activities or the rules which have to be

731
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,600
enabled those fine-grained rules have to

732
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,899
be enabled on stage basis based on

733
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:07,020
business requirements so there has to be

734
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,480
adequate business requirement why he

735
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,600
requires the additional privilege if

736
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
that is being mentioned explicitly it

737
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,460
can go via workflow to his manager or

738
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,620
supervisor he can approve it on the Fly

739
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,080
he will get the access so that's the

740
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,059
best benefit you will also get to know

741
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,000
the change management process the actual

742
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,440
change management which is happening

743
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,539
within the organization how your team is

744
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,720
working and how the approvals are being

745
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,000
given this will also fulfill your

746
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,940
auditory requirement Etc so this is how

747
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,899
the practical way to work with Solutions

748
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,500
like Pam evolve for a period of time but

749
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,299
you want to add something

750
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,299
uh this actually unfortunately reminds

751
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,659
me of an incident which happened uh my

752
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,100
friends company

753
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,940
where we got an SOS call

754
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,380
and uh

755
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,500
one of the employees

756
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,940
he was not very happy with the

757
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,840
management

758
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,659
he just walked in logged into ad wiped

759
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,520
off completely logged off went off

760
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,220
there's absolutely nothing and every

761
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,700
single Works bases that

762
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,120
and uh his wiped out completely and uh

763
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,179
backup me back up her gun so what do we

764
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,299
do so they have absolutely no clue at

765
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,640
all they I mean nobody is prepared for a

766
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,799
kind of an Insider risk

767
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,899
and I'm not saying that Insider risk is

768
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,440
a huge risk but today yes uh we have

769
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,539
heard about uh cases abroad where people

770
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,700
were recruited

771
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,919
who are part of the I mean uh who are

772
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,279
employees in the organization were asked

773
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,140
to do certain things

774
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,000
because they have been bribed and they

775
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,940
were doing it I mean uh it's something

776
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,179
from a CSO point of view you know while

777
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,120
I have to deal with external risk now I

778
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,860
have to deal with internal risk now when

779
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,240
we are talking about these kind of

780
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,520
things privileges

781
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,659
uh it's really scary thing because uh

782
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:18,240
why do I need to do frequent changes is

783
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,480
one question two uh if at all I have to

784
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,520
do do I have visibility as to why this

785
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,380
is being done is it being done by the

786
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,600
authorized people

787
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,720
uh three uh bifurcate uh uh maker

788
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,679
checker

789
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,679
you know that is I mean I'm talking uh

790
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,720
olden day spam you know because we

791
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,340
couldn't do it I mean I don't know how

792
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,340
many of you know that in the ATM box you

793
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,840
know which still runs your age-old

794
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,140
operating system you can enable your uh

795
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,700
second factor or anything because it

796
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,679
doesn't support it so what do you do

797
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,720
so it's a 14 character password two

798
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,940
people go and change the uh you know

799
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,220
login seven characters I know and the

800
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,679
Seven will he will be knowing so that's

801
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,659
the kind of process banking Industries

802
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,120
involved Indian you got this is what we

803
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,240
do so we are good at it and uh the

804
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,840
common sense uh has evolved big time to

805
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,520
address these things but if you ask me

806
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,200
as a feature from a technology

807
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,260
standpoint definitely because earlier I

808
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,659
had a plethora of uh privileges to

809
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,960
execute uh then it became to just enough

810
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,159
privileges then it went to uh zero uh

811
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,740
privileges now we are talking about

812
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,460
on-demand privileges so it's a it's a

813
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,760
it's an evolution by itself and the

814
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,000
industry needs it I mean uh it's a very

815
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,519
important piece and if it use it

816
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,380
appropriately I think it's going to be a

817
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,419
huge game changer

818
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,880
three so uh two points uh from your uh

819
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,700
from this aspect

820
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,340
you mentioned about the risks uh with

821
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,360
the inherent accounts which will have

822
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,519
you can have inside a risk or you could

823
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,260
have let's say even malwares or

824
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,779
ransomware so typically to pick on this

825
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,399
privileges because at the end of the day

826
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,739
the server doesn't know or the device

827
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,119
doesn't know where the connection is

828
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,500
coming from whether it is coming from a

829
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,839
user or from a malware or whatever right

830
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,418
it gets a right credential it will

831
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:22,139
definitely uh give the access so yes uh

832
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,179
definitely big risk reduction will

833
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,699
happen uh the other part is as you

834
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,580
mentioned just in time privileges you

835
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,239
mentioned about least privileges so if I

836
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,099
say and maybe it could be a short answer

837
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,099
if I say if your Pam can help you

838
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,040
implement this least privilege or just

839
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,139
in time privilege mechanism which is

840
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,139
post log on okay while classic Pam we

841
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,119
all talked about just pre-log on just

842
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,359
gives you access if this can help would

843
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,780
it reduce your significant secondly I am

844
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,780
using the term significantly maybe no

845
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,859
definitely it's a it's a huge uh uh what

846
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,320
to say uh

847
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,660
uh control for the CSO Community because

848
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,520
this is definitely will bring in

849
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,220
visibility as to what is happening one

850
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,099
two uh it brings accountability also

851
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,500
because it brings transparency and

852
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,540
accountability because if I'm going to

853
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,579
live it okay this person has got it and

854
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,800
he's executing it I need to figure out

855
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,420
from my dashboard okay what has happened

856
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,640
there but here how many times this has

857
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,500
happened and how many times it has gone

858
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,619
and somebody knows that okay there's a

859
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,119
two different people are being involved

860
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,880
in this maker and Checker and the moment

861
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,500
it's going to happen why did you do it

862
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,660
the moment they know that ask a question

863
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,619
why

864
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,440
then they have to think okay I have to

865
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,420
justify this so they will think twice

866
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,040
before they actually do certain things

867
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,500
so that's something which is uh you know

868
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,119
today when we talk about risk it is

869
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,280
probability to impact while impact is

870
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,140
going to remain the same I am going to

871
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,900
reduce the effect of probability as much

872
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,040
as possible

873
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,599
so if I am able to reduce the

874
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,060
probability by another 10 percent I will

875
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,020
do it

876
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,820
because that's going to be one more Toll

877
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,940
Gate uh for the uh you know for the

878
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,099
attacker to cross so that's something

879
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,339
which is very welcome

880
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,680
since you mentioned workflow for

881
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,900
privileges while we know workflow for

882
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,060
Access but you mentioned workflow for

883
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,119
privileges does workflow privileges also

884
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,000
reduce the risk inherent risk definitely

885
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,820
because as soon as the workflow will

886
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,359
evolve as a immediate manager manager

887
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,240
will question what kind of change it is

888
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,060
where are you doing it what will be the

889
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,920
impact uh and how are you doing it uh

890
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,200
have you analyzed or tested it out

891
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,140
earlier in the test environment has it

892
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,839
been ratified is it a recommended

893
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,060
solution from the OEM if you're fixing a

894
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,339
patch Etc so all those things will be

895
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,380
there and he need to answer those things

896
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,960
before his supervisor gives him the

897
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,140
access so yes that's its fail-proof

898
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,480
mechanism for the chain management and a

899
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,359
big enabler for the business also I will

900
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,940
say thank you so much final question

901
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,800
from my side uh

902
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,900
what kind of data points since you

903
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,599
mentioned dashboard right so uh what

904
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,180
kind of data points would you as a CSO

905
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,300
what do you expect uh Pam to provide to

906
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,700
help you in building your dashboard the

907
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,099
CSO dashboard or let's say a dashboard

908
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,119
for presenting to the board

909
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,339
see this is one thing which I've always

910
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,160
seen with most of the solutions

911
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,180
uh you know I keep talking with my

912
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,859
partners my OEM a lot because

913
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,960
uh it's always a symbiotic effect you

914
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,220
know they also push me to think

915
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,320
differently I also push them to think

916
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,660
differently and today if you look at

917
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,599
Matrix it is not a dashboard which I

918
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,619
Define

919
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,240
three years back and it's the same

920
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,980
dashboard I am following it I'm

921
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
monitoring it there's something wrong

922
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,780
because maybe you've addressed the risk

923
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,800
already

924
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,420
okay you have a control and you already

925
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,300
monitored and kept it but what are the

926
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,880
blips as I told you before the patterns

927
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,339
create a pattern deviations monitor that

928
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:18,480
now

929
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,300
the attack vectors and the attack groups

930
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,579
are ever changing the way there somebody

931
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,320
is going to look at now we have got

932
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,420
something as evil proxy multi-factor

933
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,940
authentication could be bypassed however

934
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,920
you get up for that I mean do we see

935
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
anything kind of blips in that so is

936
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,540
there an opportunity for that so the

937
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,119
dashboard customization and how I can uh

938
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,240
you know kind of uh draw a trend upon it

939
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,640
with respect to a particular service or

940
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,359
a port or a server or to a jio because I

941
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,640
may have global data centers so is it

942
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,220
focused on jio it's focused on a person

943
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,260
based only because whenever Bala does it

944
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,060
that's a problem that's something that's

945
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,040
uplift and that's a correlation which

946
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,920
will have to figure it out so the ask is

947
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,280
too much but uh if the OEM is able to

948
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,859
give us a platform where we can

949
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,380
customize Fields where we can bring it

950
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,720
down because every dashboard can change

951
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,119
so dynamically and if they want to bring

952
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,980
more real-time dashboard which we are

953
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,079
able to circulate and share as a widget

954
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,960
or something like that I think uh that

955
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,940
will be phenomenal for us

956
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,020
great

957
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,420
any final points from you

958
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,020
so on the dashboard uh would like to

959
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,760
know what are the normal risks or

960
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,800
violations which he is getting within

961
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,040
his environment so entire single frame

962
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,320
single console Spectrum he should be

963
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,500
able to see uh if it is a MNC

964
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,660
organization he can say multiple

965
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,480
countries if he was a genuine user or

966
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,820
not did he accessed when did he access

967
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,700
it was it during the business hours or

968
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,980
was it during the approved hours or was

969
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,560
it that he worked out of the hours and

970
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,020
then tried to do something which might

971
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,480
lead to downtime in production or later

972
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,060
on some major security incident within

973
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,680
the organization so those are the

974
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,200
violations uh which is ESO will like to

975
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,320
see also some third party Intel with

976
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,560
respect to Key Management

977
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,440
Or the critical resources ID being

978
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,960
compromised if that kind of threat Intel

979
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,420
the dashboard can give maybe an

980
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,880
immediate action can be taken then and

981
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,820
there to to avoid the Major Impact for

982
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,400
the organization

983
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,680
thank you so much

984
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,359
I know we are out of time but just in

985
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,339
case anybody has questions we can

986
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,040
probably take a couple of questions here

987
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,619
we have one question here and maybe

988
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,000
we'll take another next question here

989
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,260
yes

990
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,960
we are talking about bam and ZT in

991
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,579
general right so one of the major

992
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,700
challenge in the industry we face is

993
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,619
identifying the right solution uh

994
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,839
because even if you look at the zero

995
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,880
trust uh nsta asks come with one

996
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,680
architecture sdp has another

997
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,720
architecture and many of the

998
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
organizations are talking about outbound

999
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,200
tunnel going from the Gateway which is

1000
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,780
again another architecture right which

1001
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,220
is where most of the companies are today

1002
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,820
again so how do you identify the right

1003
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,740
architecture right organization when it

1004
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,359
comes to Pam and ZD

1005
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,240
uh there is no uh single answer to this

1006
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,800
I mean one answer doesn't fit to

1007
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
anything

1008
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,300
um it's a it's a mix and match it's a

1009
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,920
point in time decision what somebody is

1010
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,400
going to take so uh there are multiple

1011
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,740
approaches what you can look into it

1012
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,140
either you can group your high critical

1013
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,119
assets into a group

1014
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,240
and that could be one zones uh micro

1015
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,579
segmentation with Pam is going to be a

1016
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,339
very good combinations you know which is

1017
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:56,099
going to help on that uh segmentation or

1018
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,079
micro segmentation and you can group

1019
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,480
Azure or AWS separately

1020
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,820
uh see the challenges sign something

1021
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,220
different it is not about what is not

1022
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,240
available

1023
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,400
right it is about what is that you can

1024
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,820
make use of best with available ones so

1025
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,280
the the person who is going to sell the

1026
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,140
solution may not even have thought about

1027
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,220
it

1028
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,020
because it is not their problem to solve

1029
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,579
it is our problem right because we are

1030
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,680
dealing with it because we don't do it

1031
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,359
that's a risk the questions come to us

1032
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,940
so we need to handle that so we need to

1033
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,880
divide a rule that's uh that's a easiest

1034
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,160
thing which we can start with don't

1035
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,000
don't try to uh achieve Perfection on

1036
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,599
day one impossible impossible you cannot

1037
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,640
address that

1038
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,920
focus on your critical ones

1039
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,220
then medium then low scale it up

1040
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,900
have an action plan review it

1041
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,480
periodically Because unless you do this

1042
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,599
on a on a periodical basis today you may

1043
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,740
not have a solution but tomorrow

1044
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,780
something may come up so you have to

1045
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,060
keep updated on that results

1046
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,119
so there's no one answer to it but yes

1047
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,220
okay thank you second question I hope I

1048
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,720
was able to

1049
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,350
it was the second question here

1050
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:20,139
[Music]

1051
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,500
hello

1052
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,119
a Little Closer

1053
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,220
hello okay

1054
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,140
so this is regarding the user onboarding

1055
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,839
we do in Pam so for example if a user is

1056
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,640
onboarded and and requesting multiple

1057
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,220
times and different requests to make the

1058
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,720
permission changes or provide more

1059
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,119
permissions so how you how we can

1060
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,760
balance between the zero trust and and

1061
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,630
ease of operation in such cases

1062
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,720
[Music]

1063
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,339
you mind if I take that question

1064
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,079
this being on the product side probably

1065
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,200
I can answer it better so ease of

1066
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,280
operations very much understood and so

1067
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,960
there are two aspects one obviously is

1068
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,300
the access so access is not something uh

1069
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,000
which you will have too much things to

1070
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,099
debate about if you will get access to

1071
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:12,300
certain servers you get access to

1072
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,619
certain servers you cannot just simply

1073
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,119
request for Access for some other server

1074
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,160
and somebody will grant you it's more

1075
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,099
about the Privileges that you can do on

1076
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,560
those servers right so there typically

1077
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,700
Solutions today uh number one as I said

1078
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,660
Solutions today can give you least

1079
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,000
privilege so while you log in you have

1080
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,859
least privileges but then you can

1081
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,660
elevate your privileges to deliver

1082
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,420
certain let's say tasks or commands or

1083
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,579
whatever there could be certain bucket

1084
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,500
of commands which where you could

1085
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,960
request for approvals and only after

1086
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,300
that those

1087
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,740
tasks can be performed and there could

1088
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,839
be certain bucket of commands which come

1089
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,220
what may you will never be able to do

1090
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,920
something like Bala mentioned RM minus

1091
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,140
RF so you should should not be ever able

1092
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,119
to do it so those kinds of things will

1093
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,220
they can be bucketed so it will

1094
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,859
definitely ease out so you just Elevate

1095
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:04,440
for all your routine stuff request for

1096
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,160
critical stuff and other very dangerous

1097
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,859
stuff you don't do at all so just to add

1098
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:13,760
to what Jay said today you have

1099
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,520
Solutions Pam Solutions which can ensure

1100
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,040
that

1101
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,040
that you can log in only from a

1102
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,400
particular laptop and only from a

1103
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,319
particular subnet

1104
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,560
so that extent is possible so zero trust

1105
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,319
from a identity point of view from a

1106
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,480
device point of view and resource point

1107
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,420
of view is covered so earlier Pam was

1108
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,040
focused more only on the identity part

1109
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,400
it was not more focused on the on the

1110
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,180
device part of it now yes NextGen pams

1111
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,880
are looking in it yes so um continuation

1112
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,040
to that like like you mentioned just in

1113
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,960
time right so for example we are

1114
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,460
starting with the least Privileges and

1115
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,540
then requesting for just Indian

1116
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,099
privileges but do you think that will

1117
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,160
again increase the time of the uh time

1118
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,819
and and operation Operation uh for that

1119
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,099
because once he requested then it go to

1120
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,200
manager for approval and then then again

1121
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,119
the cycle will begin we can discuss it

1122
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,339
offline but yeah as such it will not

1123
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,859
because as I said routine task you will

1124
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,599
only Elevate you don't need to ask for

1125
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,460
approval routine stuff only critical

1126
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,520
stuff you want to request for Access

1127
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,280
okay it wouldn't

1128
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,020
okay I think we are already out of time

1129
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,420
thank you so much for joining this

1130
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,339
session and I thank the panelists also

1131
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,670
so much thank you Sharon thank you
