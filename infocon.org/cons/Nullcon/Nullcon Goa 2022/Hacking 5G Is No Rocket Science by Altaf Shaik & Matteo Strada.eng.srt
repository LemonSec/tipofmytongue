1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:06,020
good morning everyone and welcome to the

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,820
5G talk I think the only 5G talk in the

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,200
conference are

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,860
um

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,080
I think after the question of why

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,420
kattappa killed bahubali I think one of

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,640
the most Googled questions is that what

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,340
is 5G and not just on internet but

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,439
politically there is quite a lot of

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,920
curiosity what is 5G and basically

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,260
um how does attacks looks like in the

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,080
next let's say 10 years because

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,820
fifth generation networks will be until

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,880
like 2030 so so in this talk I will

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,640
actually expose a new era of attacks in

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
Telecom networks and also show that why

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,820
attacks in 5G are much easier to do

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,760
compared to what was achieved in the

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,039
last let's say in the last 2G 3G 4G

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,899
networks but before that I want to give

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,520
you a glimpse of what attacks actually

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,340
looks like in mobile networks so there

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,660
can be attacks over the radio Access

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,600
Network which is over the air

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
the exploit may be lack of

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,359
authentication and there are other

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,739
security protocols that could be

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,320
exploited then maybe you heard of ss7 or

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,939
diameter attacks which is the

30
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,020
interconnection between different

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,720
operators uh maybe you also heard of sim

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
attacks that exploit some type of

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,400
browsers inside the SIM card or SMS spam

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,280
attacks other back doors that usually

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,320
exist in network equipment which is

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,140
nothing but like black boxes so far but

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,759
if you look at all these attacks they

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,159
are pretty much like user targeted

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,960
attacks so which means they try to

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,060
gather information from a specific user

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,400
or a bunch of users or they like to

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,159
track and intercept calls of a bunch of

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,460
users or maybe they try to do some kind

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,460
of Fraud and exploit billing mechanisms

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,799
inside mobile networks this was the case

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,020
until now and then maybe 5G will

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,060
definitely change the way attacks

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,700
usually happen because 5G is not any the

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,040
next technology that is used for you to

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,659
to just talk about the phones but it's

51
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,939
more like a technology that's that's

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,979
coming to connect Industries or like

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:02,780
connect

54
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,219
infrastructure such as autonomous

55
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,079
vehicles or your iboat infrastructure

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,239
your clouds basically everything can be

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,520
plugged into mobile networks and they

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
can be controlled like remote pretty

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,379
much basically everywhere or even like

60
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,940
Health infrastructure doesn't have to be

61
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,099
like simple devices but it could also

62
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,140
connect critical infrastructures or even

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,360
governments will definitely depend on 5G

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,580
networks because you could build a

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,800
complete private 5G networks and in this

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
case like the if you look at the threat

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,900
is more towards the Industries or like

68
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
the threat is enormous compared to what

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,760
it was because the attacks were user

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,019
targeted in the past Networks

71
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,379
um you might

72
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,420
because uh some I mean people are

73
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,760
curious like okay why is this why why is

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,379
it talking that like I mean attacks

75
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,940
could be much easier in 5G networks

76
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,920
compared to what it was previously so if

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,239
you look at how protocols actually

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,480
evolved from 2G 3G 4G if you look there

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,060
are like uh like the if you look at the

80
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,700
map protocols or ss7 protocols diameter

81
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,459
protocols these are pretty much not

82
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,160
really understandable by a simple

83
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,860
internet user so these are pretty much

84
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,200
you have to be inside the Telecom and

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,239
then like you understand the complexity

86
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,340
of these protocols was pretty high but

87
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,239
now with 5G they are moving to apis so

88
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,879
all the internals of the core Network or

89
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,560
you bring any other components in into

90
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,060
the mobile network they will be pretty

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,459
much connected using apis I mean the

92
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,379
apis that I think pretty much everybody

93
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,480
in this room is aware of it's based on

94
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,099
the HTTP 2 protocols they could be rest

95
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,340
apis or any other type of apis but it's

96
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,080
pretty much moving to an internet based

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,959
architecture rather than some kind of

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,060
traditional proprietary close

99
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,099
architectures so I think that's one of

100
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,440
the reasons like why attacks will be

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,060
much more attractive or easier to

102
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,500
perform compared to what it was

103
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,480
previously because you don't need any

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,220
kind of like heavy infrastructure that

105
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,959
we always use such as like software

106
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,599
defined radios or or maybe any other RF

107
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,659
Equipment that was used so far but now

108
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,879
this will definitely be a game changer

109
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,400
by having apis in the network and how

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
careful The Operators or anyone using a

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,620
5G Network like should be careful in

112
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,139
setting up their private networks or

113
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,000
like 5G networks let's say so this is

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,220
just a simple example of a 5G core

115
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,019
Network as you see you have a mobile

116
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,120
device then you have a base station and

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,620
the rest of it is the core Network so

118
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,000
all what I'm telling is like all these

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,840
interfaces are now replaced to use apis

120
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,259
so that makes this more attractive for

121
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,080
anyone who wants to look into security

122
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,759
let's say I mean you don't really need

123
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,280
to learn something extra to hack a 5G

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,199
Network let's say

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,720
um before I actually show you like uh

126
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
one part of the 5G Network that is that

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,820
we actually exploited we try to find

128
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,520
many vulnerabilities inside the apis or

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
like how the networks are configured I

130
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,940
would like to give you a little bit

131
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,680
introduction about like what is this new

132
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,840
interface and how does it look like and

133
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,520
how somebody can actually get access to

134
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,660
that

135
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,220
um so here is a general mobile network

136
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,960
as you see there are devices on the left

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,360
side then you have base stations which

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,460
are connected to the code Network and

139
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,280
usual interfaces like ss7 diameter or

140
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,320
like these are the interfaces that

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
connect between operators then you have

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,580
the data network interface through which

143
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,100
your mobile devices access internet and

144
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,380
now there is this new door or like you

145
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,300
can also call like a new interface which

146
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,340
is a standardized interface it's called

147
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,000
a network exposure interface and this

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
door actually opens to Vertical

149
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,380
Industries or third parties or you could

150
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,680
also open it to Cloud providers you name

151
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,560
the company so basically everybody

152
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,580
when I say everybody it means like

153
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,500
companies or like organizations that

154
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,060
want to connect

155
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,100
um or integrate their infrastructure

156
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,720
with the mobile network can actually

157
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,539
access this exposure interface so going

158
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,160
a little bit more detail into this

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,139
interface so as you see like let's take

160
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,759
different Industries like smart

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,580
factories or smartphones or Smart Homes

162
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,880
or you take any any other industry so

163
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,919
their devices are connected to the the

164
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,419
radio Access Network like the base

165
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,979
stations

166
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,380
um and we see there is an mno which is a

167
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,740
network provider like a network operator

168
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,259
who holds this whole 4G 5G core Network

169
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,500
and then exposes certain apis and then

170
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,240
we call them technically like not bound

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,759
apis and they are I mean they could be

172
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,139
directly provided to the vertical

173
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,360
Industries or third parties or in

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,979
between there could be an intermediate

175
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,620
you can call it like a provider or you

176
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,500
can call it a virtual operator or an iot

177
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,900
service provider or a platform provider

178
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,280
like you you can call it in different

179
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,620
ways who actually take this Northbound

180
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,800
apis and then convert them to something

181
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,259
like service apis and then these service

182
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,539
apis could be tailored to specific

183
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,880
industry let's say you are providing

184
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,860
service apis to Smart Factory so the

185
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,780
apis will be different compared to what

186
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,000
you provide to a Smart hospital so these

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,039
apis will now be exposed to the

188
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,500
applications domain where third parties

189
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,720
or like Industries can access these apis

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
and then now integrate their

191
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,680
applications into that so I give you one

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
example here let's let's talk about

193
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,660
drone so this is a picture from

194
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,000
vodafone's 5G Mobility lab in Germany

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,660
um

196
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,639
so you see this network exposure layer

197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,800
here in the middle and which is

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,419
connected to the core Network and the

199
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,759
Drone is nothing but one of your let's

200
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,220
say mobile devices now I mean you might

201
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,900
have seen drones being controlled with

202
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,720
Wi-Fi or maybe any other low power

203
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,940
technology like like a local area

204
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,400
networks but now it's more you want to

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
connect them to the mobile network so

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
that you can control the Drone basically

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
from anywhere like you can sit in

208
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,020
another country and then you can have

209
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,180
access to these apis and then these apis

210
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,460
will allow you to control your drone

211
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,199
because your drone is now connected to

212
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,060
the mobile network and that is basically

213
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,620
reachable from anywhere

214
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,880
um maybe the same use case I can also

215
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,860
also explain in a different way like for

216
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,319
example maybe with DHL as well like the

217
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,539
the DHL trucks how they operate these

218
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,819
days maybe you have uh continuous

219
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,259
updates when you buy something on Amazon

220
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,960
maybe you are receiving that uh the the

221
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
truck is let's say seven blocks away

222
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,819
from you know delivering you so this

223
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,440
level of real-time updates are actually

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
possible by having access to these kind

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,360
of apis

226
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
so just to summarize this one like it's

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,860
more the future in Telecom is nothing

228
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,840
but like pretty much with apis and then

229
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,580
this is just the people of the iceberg

230
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,839
that I'm showing like it's a new

231
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
interface that I'm showing but if you

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
look more detail into the core Network

233
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
it's completely filled with a lot of

234
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,958
apis so it's pure API research

235
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,060
um if you are confusing with some of the

236
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,680
API attacks that happen in the past

237
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,260
these are different from what the API

238
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,240
attacks I'm talking now because those

239
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
API attacks in the past are basically

240
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,620
some web interfaces that are not that

241
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,420
are supposed not to be exposed on the

242
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,279
internet but these interfaces that I'm

243
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
talking now are something standardized

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,019
and are particularly like open on

245
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,600
purpose so that Industries can be

246
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,700
integrated with mobile networks so there

247
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,260
is a big difference in that and then

248
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,140
this talk uh I will give you uh starting

249
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,600
with how do we commercially get access

250
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,060
to this network exposure or the API

251
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,740
service apis that I was talking about

252
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,019
and then what features or configurations

253
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,300
it has and then what are our security

254
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,820
allegations in that what did we do what

255
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,860
API

256
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,480
vulnerabilities we found and then how

257
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,240
did our responsible disclosure go and

258
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,459
some key takeaways from that so just the

259
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,380
same picture from the previous slides

260
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,360
but a little bit more elaborated like

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,180
how does it look in a commercial

262
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,519
environment so on the left side you have

263
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,920
additionally an iot SIM card so this is

264
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,140
a specific SIM card that you get when

265
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,240
you subscribe to something called a

266
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,580
network exposure or the API services so

267
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,899
you get this SIM card and then you

268
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,940
insert into all your devices and they

269
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,260
can be now connected to the mobile

270
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,500
network so and now the key part here is

271
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,420
the one in the in the blue blue area

272
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,120
which is called an iot service platform

273
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,060
so I would be more focusing on iot's

274
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,500
type of

275
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,200
let's say Services I mean you could

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,120
basically everything is iot like if you

277
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
if you want to be very generic uh but as

278
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,800
you see here now

279
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,700
um

280
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,800
going a bit detail into this picture so

281
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,779
there's something called service apis

282
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,700
which you saw before and additionally

283
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,019
there is something called iot

284
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,180
connectivity management platform so this

285
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,220
is nothing but like a web web interface

286
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,519
that third parties actually get so that

287
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,560
they can let's say configure their SIM

288
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,800
cards or like have much more control in

289
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,459
um

290
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,880
to control their SIM cards so uh let me

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,940
just go here so how does this uh access

292
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,920
getting access start so first of all you

293
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
have to buy the SIM cards so these are

294
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,779
like I said not similar to like the SIM

295
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,339
cards that we use in smartphones so they

296
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,140
are pretty much different so they just

297
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,040
have

298
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
um let's say some MB of data I mean

299
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,260
depending on the use case of iot maybe

300
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,180
some SMS and then it has a 10-year

301
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,060
lifetime roaming free and it just costs

302
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,100
let's say ten dollars depending on where

303
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,480
you buy it

304
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,000
um it pretty much connects to 4G or any

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,279
other networks beyond that let's say 5G

306
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,260
as well and

307
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,920
um

308
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,140
like I don't know if you follow telecoms

309
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,760
like you know that SIM cards can be

310
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,579
identified with MC or iccid like these

311
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,040
are some key identities that you get to

312
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
identify SIM cards when you connect them

313
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
to the network so first of all you go to

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,380
the service provider and then say that

315
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,019
you need you want access to this

316
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,820
particular exposure and then provide

317
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,920
your company identity like maybe a tax

318
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,980
ID or let's say any other corporate

319
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,140
identity that you have you provide that

320
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,940
and then you subscribe to a specific

321
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,160
plan you receive the SIM cards pretty

322
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,620
much by email or like the mail service

323
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,839
then you receive access to this API

324
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,600
portal that I showed before

325
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
so you need some credentials to access

326
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,740
the API so you get them over email and

327
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,779
now you get take the SIM cards insert

328
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,360
into your devices and you have connected

329
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,700
them to the network and Hereafter like

330
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,800
you you can basically access the SIM

331
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,740
cards first of all by activating the API

332
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,980
credentials and after that you can take

333
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,480
these apis and then integrate with your

334
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,820
infrastructure that you have

335
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,279
so just some screenshots of like how

336
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
does uh a connectivity management

337
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,300
platform look like so as you see here

338
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,620
like there are SIM cards on the left

339
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,480
like I mean we we purchase let's say

340
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,700
maybe five SIM cards from a specific

341
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,320
operator I'm not telling the names of

342
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,060
the operator out but maybe I can tell

343
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,380
you like from which countries we

344
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,480
actually purchase these SIM cards

345
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,339
um so you see here like there are two

346
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,779
different screenshots so one is from

347
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,399
another operator and then the other one

348
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,100
from another operator so we can actually

349
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,380
see the emcee of the SIM card then how

350
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,880
much data it has how much data it's

351
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
consumed and whether it's this SIM card

352
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,399
actually online or basically offline

353
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,860
um so we can purchase data for this SIM

354
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,899
card we can add extra volumes or like

355
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,980
SMS or maybe create API users or like

356
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,660
developers like we can create multiple

357
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,940
API users and then Developers for this

358
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,560
one

359
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,800
um it's in I mean apart from this then

360
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,779
there is service apis like it's just

361
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,600
like plain apis that you see in any kind

362
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,240
of like Swagger interface so first of

363
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,620
all to use the API you should be

364
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,839
authenticated and authorized which means

365
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,000
you need to have some credentials

366
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,920
um so these are like provided by the

367
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,420
operator when you purchase the you know

368
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,060
like the API access then

369
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,339
you might be wondering like for for what

370
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,560
actually I need this API so you could

371
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,600
actually use these apis to query the the

372
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,779
GPS information of your device or let's

373
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,000
say you could use uh to send direct

374
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,579
messages to the devices like any kind of

375
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,920
videos or like or you want to send some

376
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,779
kind of like configuration messages to

377
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,820
the devices

378
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,060
but for for to do sorry like to do all

379
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,620
this like we need to have some kind of a

380
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,480
service level agreement between the

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
industry and the operator like once this

382
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,920
is agreed then the industry like

383
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,760
basically can control uh

384
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,120
yeah the industry can basically control

385
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,579
let's say do a lot of like device IP

386
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,260
address management it can control the

387
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,060
roaming policies for the device it can

388
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,040
increase the data rate for the device or

389
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,680
or bandwidth or let's say it's also set

390
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,079
sleep modes for the device

391
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,760
um besides this there are like admin

392
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,040
control functions such as like billing

393
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
or data plane management or you could uh

394
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,779
update the credentials of the SIM card

395
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,639
as well

396
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,440
um just a screenshot of another like how

397
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,720
service apis actually look like like you

398
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,060
have a device inside a SIM card or you

399
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,519
can actually delete a SIM card you can

400
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,620
obtain the details of the SIM card so

401
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,940
you can do pretty much a lot of

402
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,339
different things just by using the apis

403
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,260
you can query the information of the SIM

404
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,300
card which was never possible until now

405
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,579
and this is something only possible with

406
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,560
4G and 5G Networks

407
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,779
so just to summarize again the whole

408
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,639
picture like how it looks like you have

409
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,399
service apis uh plus you have iot

410
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,079
connectivity management platforms which

411
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,540
is nothing but a web interface

412
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,760
um to let's say to configure and then

413
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,980
control the SIM cards then a lot of

414
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,380
service apis and then to access

415
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,139
information about the SIM cards itself

416
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,600
well we also have to talk about security

417
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
when it comes to using the API so well

418
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,699
standard security measures like

419
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,100
authentication authorization then using

420
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,839
all out for these apis is something

421
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,480
mandatory that what the 3gpp standard

422
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,639
recommends then of course like you need

423
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,560
to maintain the privacy of the SIM cards

424
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,480
once the information of the SIM cards is

425
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,940
exposed in the apis so I will go through

426
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,860
all of this but besides these standard

427
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,380
security measures there are rate

428
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,360
limiting or let's say logging and

429
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,160
monitoring features which usually come

430
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,380
with apis when you let's say when you

431
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,660
subscribe to apis and then or the API

432
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,639
servers they usually come with these

433
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,500
kind of services

434
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,279
um

435
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
I give you one more example like how the

436
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,540
API actually works like in general like

437
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,699
just going a bit more detail so there's

438
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,160
an API user from a company uh who

439
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,920
already have access and then they try to

440
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,600
establish a TLS session with the API

441
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,459
server then following they send the

442
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,560
credentials username password that was

443
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
received in the email

444
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,980
then following that they receive a token

445
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,779
depending on if there is an oauth

446
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,660
security mechanism so using the token

447
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,240
you just send a specific API request for

448
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,040
example here you see that device

449
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,079
connectivity and location status so you

450
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,660
want to send the EMC of the device and

451
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,540
then you want to get back where is the

452
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,639
exact location of the device so as you

453
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,100
see that the information in the the API

454
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,139
response you see that there's a the

455
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,940
information of the SIM card itself like

456
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,000
ICC ID EMC what is the phone number then

457
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,279
which organization ID or like which

458
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,959
which company actually owns this SIM

459
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,240
card then some more internals of the

460
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,800
core Network are also provided inside

461
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,740
this API response so this is just a

462
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,540
little bit of information that I pasted

463
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,699
here but there can be pretty much a lot

464
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,619
of information about the core Network

465
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,380
itself that could we can actually call

466
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,179
it like over exposure of data sometimes

467
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,400
like you leak extra information which is

468
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,140
not supposed to be leaked such as

469
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,720
internal software core Network

470
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,380
um

471
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,119
so maybe some more screenshots of like

472
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,160
how it actually looks in reality like

473
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,260
how um when we query the location of the

474
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,079
SIM card so we also get the ID like the

475
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,000
IP address of the device that is holding

476
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,439
the SIM card

477
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,960
um plus a bunch of other internal

478
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,500
communication that's actually going on

479
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,320
okay so besides just getting the

480
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,140
location you can also send direct

481
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,000
messages to the devices so which means

482
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,039
you can send a downlink message it could

483
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,919
be either an SMS or a traditional IP

484
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,539
message that you can actually send to

485
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,000
the device so as you see here

486
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,080
um

487
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,940
I mean we are just I think it's a

488
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,380
screenshot of like sending a downlink

489
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,600
message so beyond that there is also a

490
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,039
Next Level thing which you could

491
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
actually do which is like uploading a

492
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,720
key like usually SIM card has a master

493
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,640
key every SIM card has a master key and

494
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,760
it's a unique master key and here the

495
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,039
the feature is that using the apis you

496
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,919
can actually post a new master key to

497
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,720
the operators Network so operator will

498
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,299
actually accept this new master key and

499
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,280
then update it remotely over the SIM

500
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,679
card as well so once this is done there

501
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,020
is a complete change of the security

502
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,700
let's say because you're changing the

503
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,559
master key so obviously the rest of the

504
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,820
keys that are derived from the master

505
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,640
key will basically change and this is

506
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,020
one of the features that we also tried

507
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,419
and then I will talk you through what

508
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,740
kind of vulnerabilities like we actually

509
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,840
found in these features and then how we

510
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
exploit it so for that like I just want

511
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
to give you how the attack model in this

512
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,320
kind of situation looks like maybe you

513
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,179
heard of the attack model over the radio

514
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,740
interface there is a passive one then

515
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,780
there's an active one like you you have

516
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,000
to pass simply sniff the network or

517
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
actively transmit something over the

518
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,140
radio network but an attack model like

519
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,419
this it's basically you need to have

520
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,980
first of all a business relationship

521
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,740
with the operator like or someone who is

522
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,419
actually providing this exposure maybe

523
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,760
it's like getting access to a certain

524
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,280
cloud like a cloud provider as well so

525
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
that's why I said it could be an

526
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,000
external like like someone who is trying

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,740
to get a relationship with the provider

528
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,000
so which means like having a business

529
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,460
relationship or it could be an Insider

530
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,380
like the API developed for somebody who

531
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,240
actually developed those apis like a

532
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,980
malicious developer

533
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,720
um because once you have the business

534
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
relationship like you are actually part

535
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
of the cloud So This Cloud maybe holds

536
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,020
different Industries like it could also

537
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,360
hold Amazon it could also hold Honeywell

538
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,960
like it could hold maybe like many other

539
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Industries also part of this cloud and

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
then they access the apis as well so the

541
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,100
attacker is basically part of the whole

542
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,740
Cloud so getting there itself is one of

543
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,780
the first let's say is a major success

544
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,280
because because after that it's nothing

545
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,380
but tinkering with the apis and then

546
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,940
seeing if you can find vulnerabilities

547
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,880
and then like that

548
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,500
so you have the credentials because once

549
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,059
you set up a business relationship like

550
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,679
you get

551
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,600
um let's say the like the username

552
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,059
password to actually access these apis

553
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,919
so once you have this I think the

554
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,539
Privileges are nothing but you need to

555
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,400
have API knowledge I think it's not that

556
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,860
difficult then you need to have internet

557
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,260
to access these apis and this could be

558
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,679
done remotely or you could stay use a

559
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,419
VPN or like thought or whatever like I

560
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,299
mean it's up to the capability of the

561
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,340
attacker then the goals here are would

562
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,059
be to obtain access to arbitrary iot

563
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,860
devices let's say I know there's a

564
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,419
company like which I want to Target and

565
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,900
then they have let's say cloud access or

566
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,179
like API access to a certain provider so

567
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,820
I would also buy access to the with the

568
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,679
same provider and then try to access

569
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,900
apis and see if I can actually access

570
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,480
the devices of my target industry like

571
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,760
can I actually

572
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,200
find some API vulnerabilities and then

573
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,760
try to

574
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,520
Target those particular devices so in

575
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,100
basically that that's that's one goal

576
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,960
then the remaining goals would be to

577
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,940
compromise this API server that you're

578
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,039
seeing here and see that this is

579
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,020
directly connected to the 4G or 5G core

580
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,419
Network so once I compromise this API

581
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,940
server my next Target would be like can

582
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,860
I actually penetrate into the 4G or 5G

583
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,620
core Network which was so far like quite

584
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,440
difficult because S7 or diameter the

585
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,480
only interfaces like that were open not

586
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,820
open but like were kind of like trusted

587
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,740
interfaces are closed in between Only

588
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,419
The Operators but these kind of

589
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,400
interfaces open up to public over the

590
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
internet and the kind of thread it's

591
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,620
it's it's quite big because anybody in

592
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,120
the room can be an attacker because you

593
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,700
just need to let's say

594
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,860
obtain SIM cards and then or the API

595
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,960
access

596
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,880
um I mean so we started looking into

597
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
this particular Network exposure

598
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,760
commercially and then some of the

599
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,740
questions that come with us like come to

600
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,140
us uh when when we know that okay it's

601
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,179
full of apis and it's API security so

602
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,559
some of the questions that come to mind

603
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,240
is like are the standard security

604
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,860
mechanisms that I actually showed you

605
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,960
are they sufficient like enough to

606
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,299
protect core networks from any kind of

607
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,360
attacks or let's I we know that like

608
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,820
apis use firewalls are they enough are

609
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,039
they sufficient are they like follow

610
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,840
security by Design principles like can

611
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,539
they prevent many type of attacks and we

612
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,220
also know that like these API servers

613
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,159
that you saw before commercially maybe

614
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,620
not all of them thoroughly tested so

615
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,299
maybe some might use just some security

616
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,059
scanners or automated testing principles

617
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,600
and then nobody knows like what kind of

618
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,919
bugs are involved in this and most of

619
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,200
these platforms are like are quite new

620
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,840
so I would say developed after 2019 or

621
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,620
like 2020 or 2021 so during this period

622
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,340
um

623
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,100
so what happens in this case is like

624
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,020
um an insecure API will actually give

625
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,480
you access to the API server first of

626
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,700
all and then the customer data which is

627
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,460
hosted on that API server plus you also

628
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,620
capture the core Network and uh and the

629
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,120
underlying iot devices that are

630
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,620
connected connected to that mobile

631
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,918
network

632
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,740
um so what we did we made business

633
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,539
relationships with so many operators

634
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,059
let's say nine or ten of them and then

635
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,820
try to obtain SIM cards and we

636
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,500
particularly like I was located in

637
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,240
Germany back then so this was during the

638
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,539
Kobe time so I was even though like not

639
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,280
going to the office I was quite occupied

640
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,080
with all this stuff so

641
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,000
um obtaining the SIM cards was itself a

642
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,860
bit of hassle because they need to ship

643
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,740
physically so there was quite of a delay

644
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,299
and then but still like we managed to

645
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,240
get them so some operators are from

646
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,220
Germany and some of them are actually

647
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,159
from us and some of them from Israel so

648
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,260
we try to cover different operators so

649
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,580
that we get to see different

650
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,559
implementations maybe people have

651
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,659
different security policies because it's

652
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,520
not just about the company but it's also

653
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,799
about the government that is located in

654
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,659
the country and that's also able to

655
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,419
let's say direct how the 5G security

656
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,280
should look like

657
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,080
um so we have the SIM cards which means

658
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,340
like we also have access to the service

659
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,280
apis and each operator provides maybe up

660
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,520
to 400 or 500 different apis to cover

661
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,679
different applications so here is just a

662
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,419
simple summary of like what are the

663
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,940
basic security mechanisms that they have

664
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,280
like some of them yeah some of them

665
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,700
don't do authentication so they just

666
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,400
give you a token to access the apis then

667
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,919
some of them of course follow out with

668
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,360
the with the standard mechanisms and

669
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,820
then use TLS and most of the platforms

670
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,700
are actually hosted on these clouds so

671
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,320
and some of them are like virtual

672
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,299
operators some of them are nothing but

673
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,880
platform providers

674
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,440
um so we started analyzing these

675
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,240
platforms uh first of all to find

676
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,700
vulnerabilities in API configuration or

677
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,860
input validation so I think these are

678
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,840
the classic attacks that people are

679
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,419
aware if you're in API security and see

680
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,159
if we can break the authentication or

681
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,840
access control or when it comes to

682
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,780
encryption like can we use only plain

683
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,000
HTTP based apis

684
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,460
um so like like I said there are like so

685
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,240
many hundreds of apis and it's really

686
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,580
intensive or like it's huge work to go

687
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,440
through all the apis so we have to pick

688
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,159
certain apis and and these apis should

689
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
have like a bigger impact so such as we

690
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,419
pick these apis such as like where we

691
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,260
can exchange SMS or IP data with devices

692
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,220
or like location retrieval apis or other

693
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,960
apis such as like they can update

694
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,700
configurations in the core Network like

695
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,640
we can switch off another remote another

696
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,940
device so by just tuning its sleep modes

697
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,740
using the apis like we can set a sleep

698
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,900
mode to a bunch of iot devices and then

699
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,240
put them to sleep and these devices like

700
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,340
don't belong to us so that's some of the

701
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,720
functions like we were targeting and

702
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,620
then

703
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,120
um well of course there is money as well

704
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,580
like can we think of it the billing uh

705
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,980
procedures because now it was billing

706
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,659
procedures were always like inside the

707
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,039
core network but now they're actually

708
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,260
exposed outside which means like others

709
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,640
can also control some parts of the

710
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,279
billing so can we like reset some of the

711
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,919
billing or like charging counters or the

712
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,779
the interesting one is also like can we

713
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,179
upload a new master key into the network

714
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,820
so it's basically if I if I find a

715
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,159
vulnerability in the API which I can

716
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,100
update is a key a master key of a

717
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,419
particular SIM card that I'm actually

718
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:19,860
targeting

719
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,640
um

720
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
so

721
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,659
and then well I mean if you're looking

722
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,340
at API security there are like plenty of

723
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,340
resources I think from ovasp how do you

724
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,740
actually test some of these apis

725
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,940
um they're like some other tools like

726
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,460
burp zap or let's say some other tools

727
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,260
that we actually developed but something

728
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,600
that was quite challenging was because

729
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,640
all the API security that you see in the

730
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,580
market are existing so far they are

731
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,240
pretty much tied to I mean they're not

732
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,980
customized or like the tools or the

733
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,080
research that you see has nothing to do

734
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,360
with Telecom applications because these

735
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,980
apis are quite new into the Telecom

736
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,440
industry and the the attacks or the

737
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,020
threat models that apply to Telecom

738
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,700
industry are not actually existing

739
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,000
anywhere so it took for us quite a bit

740
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
of challenge like to find specific API

741
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,100
parameters that you can actually Target

742
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,779
or modify the tools for example like

743
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,460
burp suit I mean you cannot just plug

744
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,500
and play you need a lot of extensive

745
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,360
efforts to modify the apis and then

746
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,960
Tinker with them and see if we can find

747
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,380
one abilities in this one because I said

748
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,179
that we have business relationship with

749
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,919
the operators or like from where we

750
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,600
actually got the SIM card so we are

751
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,419
using legitimate IDs to register with

752
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,279
them so we have to be quite ethical when

753
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,279
we do so we don't really bombard the

754
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,080
platform with a lot of API requests so

755
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,900
we try to be responsible and only Tinker

756
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,940
with the apis that we have so that we

757
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,919
don't mess with we know that there are

758
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,480
like thousands of devices hosted on the

759
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,220
platform you can basically see that so

760
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,600
we don't want to mess with all of them

761
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,360
and then try to be more intelligent

762
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,679
while doing this kind of a testing

763
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,600
rather than just some random penetration

764
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,740
or like fuzzing

765
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,260
um one of the first uh well I would say

766
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,640
vulnerability are kind of a weakness

767
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,220
that we figured out was getting access

768
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,020
to the platform like I said getting

769
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,940
access to the platform itself is quite

770
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,179
uh a big issue as well so

771
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,679
um most of the SIM cards that you can

772
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,120
actually receive are by basically

773
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,580
registering uh your company with your

774
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,159
tax ID so you could basically Forge any

775
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,840
company's tax ID because this

776
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,700
information is not secret and you can

777
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,220
basically get it online and you can

778
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,260
spoof somebody's email address and try

779
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,179
to register or like Forge a company and

780
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,580
then register for the API access on that

781
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,980
company name so with this first of all

782
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,960
like you get you're on the platform you

783
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,880
get access to the apis but Hereafter

784
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,320
like it's

785
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,260
um it's basically you are

786
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,220
destroying the reputation of some other

787
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,960
company let's say this company doesn't

788
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
have a business relationship with the

789
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,919
provider that you're registering so you

790
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,440
are forging someone else and then trying

791
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,799
to get access and uh so some of the

792
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,720
common API weaknesses that we found in

793
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,520
this platform I would call Mateo to

794
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,600
present that

795
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,779
yeah

796
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:09,000
thank you Alda for the introduction so I

797
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,760
will showcase a bit the more web related

798
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,260
vulnerabilities that we've found

799
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,159
actually in the apis so first thing

800
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,380
first passwords of course because

801
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,480
passwords are the keys to Kingdom so

802
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,700
they are used both to get access to the

803
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,000
management interfaces and also to

804
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,820
interact with some of the apis so what

805
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,980
we found was that frequently the

806
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,720
password creation their update and

807
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,520
management was not compliant with the

808
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,820
gsma guidelines in fact weak password

809
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,940
such as root admin password one two one

810
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,700
two three were frequently allowed and

811
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
only a few of the operators would

812
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,000
actually check the entered passwords

813
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,880
against weak passwords list and they

814
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,039
would reject the creation of an account

815
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,779
with such a password

816
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,020
the issue is this control was still not

817
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,820
applied when you would update the

818
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,380
password so you could create an account

819
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,179
with a strong password and then change

820
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,159
it to a weak password this could be done

821
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,960
by an attacker for instance by hijacking

822
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,500
the account and it's definitely an issue

823
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,779
so the fix in this case is to comply

824
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,840
with the best password practices either

825
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,480
by following gsma guidelines or the old

826
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,779
wasp or other entities which are plenty

827
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,220
out there

828
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,860
second thing is token management so as

829
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,159
altaf said 5G and the service based

830
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,159
architecture relies heavily on oauth 2

831
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,340
as authentication mechanism based on JWT

832
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,580
tokens the issue in this case was that

833
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,760
oauth was not really used on many of the

834
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,000
actual API platforms and the iot

835
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,620
exposure platforms those who used oauth

836
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,320
and JWT token would in fact have a very

837
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,799
high and very long expiry time like 24

838
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,640
sorry 24 hours to one week which is a

839
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,179
lot for an iot device and some of them

840
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,179
would even use a static token which

841
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,460
should have been revoked after each

842
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,279
every each API call but this was not the

843
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,140
case and one of them even brought it

844
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,360
further by using a single static API

845
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,000
token which was not revocable and was

846
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,460
shared across all devices so that's

847
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,020
definitely an issue because an attacker

848
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,059
could just steal the device read the

849
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,520
configuration have the API token and

850
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,440
interact with the whole backend just by

851
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
using that token so the fix is just to

852
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,360
follow the three gpp guidelines and

853
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,460
using all and Json web tokens for

854
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,580
authorization and and

855
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,260
implementing custom and short validity

856
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,220
periods for the type of iot use case

857
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,179
um

858
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,179
rate limiting is something super

859
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:55,980
important for API requests this was also

860
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,580
to not to exhaust the resource of like a

861
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,279
resource intensive operations but also

862
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,279
to prevent brute force and other another

863
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,740
issues in this case so only two

864
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,500
platforms had actual in place some rate

865
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,100
limits for the api's request and

866
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,159
we tested this by sending 400 valid get

867
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,779
and post requests in a short period of

868
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,299
time using the same IP address and then

869
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,539
using the same account what we've seen

870
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,640
was that no back-off period or IP ban

871
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,159
was issued for either the account or the

872
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,580
IP for all requests

873
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,620
interestingly enough some providers

874
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,659
would specify in their documentation the

875
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,460
presence of rate limiting capabilities

876
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,500
but these were not actually implemented

877
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,559
so we could still

878
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:51,139
do brute forcing another kind of attacks

879
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,120
um yet another is verbose error messages

880
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,600
while this might not usually be much of

881
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,159
an interest because they could disclose

882
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,020
the back end and something we could

883
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,899
relying just an error message on error

884
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,720
messages we could uh probe the MC the

885
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,120
ICC ID and the IMEI so we could actually

886
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,640
figure out if an MC would exist or it

887
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,679
wouldn't

888
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,179
in this case this is a problem because

889
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,220
knowing the emcee of other subscriber

890
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,140
could lead to further attacks which are

891
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,120
not more directly on the core network

892
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,519
but are actually attacking an end user

893
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,980
so a never higher degree of of

894
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,320
criticality the fix for this is to

895
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,720
implement generic error messages like

896
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,360
unauthorized internal server and

897
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,220
whatever not disclose any information to

898
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,320
the end user

899
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,659
script injection was another common

900
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,899
thing we've been successful in six

901
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,899
platforms out of the ten we tested and

902
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,299
this is because many apis would simply

903
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,760
accept whatever string you will you will

904
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,700
send them so we could send SQL commands

905
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,279
and full uh scripts like the CrossFit

906
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,620
scripting you see here

907
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,460
um

908
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,059
there would usually be on the web portal

909
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,159
and management interface there will be a

910
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,099
check there for a dangerous characters

911
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,199
and scripts but this would not happen if

912
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,699
you would send the same request and the

913
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,639
same update request via the API so we

914
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,280
could in fact inject a cross-site

915
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,739
scripting via the API and then triggered

916
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,219
it by browsing the web management

917
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,219
interface thus we had stored cross-aid

918
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,520
scripting with all the downfalls of such

919
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,219
vulnerabilities

920
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,719
as strict input sanitization for each

921
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,580
and every parameter should be used in

922
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,098
this case to avoid this type of attacks

923
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,859
um again as altaf portrayed apis and

924
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,599
exposure platforms are very complex

925
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,000
systems so it's easy to do

926
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,099
misconfigurations and they are so

927
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,080
complex that some of the operators would

928
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,839
even allow you to create your own

929
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,060
private networks just by using the apis

930
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,700
you do realize that if this is the case

931
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,800
it's easy to get something wrong and

932
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,339
access control is is the victim in this

933
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,619
case so we found there were some

934
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,720
discrepancies between some API

935
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,339
documentation and the actual software

936
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,700
implementation so admin only API

937
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,560
function like sending binary data and

938
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,359
updating building information were made

939
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,000
available to the standard API user plus

940
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,859
even more as you can see from the

941
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,079
screenshot there were some restricted

942
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,660
profiles which are meant to be given to

943
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,820
user to test out the platform but they

944
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,920
were not restricted they were not

945
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,380
restricted at all and in fact with the

946
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,599
restricted user we will still manage to

947
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,680
get some sensitive information like the

948
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,680
ggsn and the sgsn address of the

949
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,460
specific Gateway

950
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,500
um finally

951
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,780
um almost all the apis had a web

952
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,520
application firewall in front of them

953
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,640
because of the added layer of protection

954
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,380
and still we could re relying on the

955
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,599
errors both from the firewall and the

956
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,520
actual apis we could still fingerprint

957
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,560
all the tech stack used so like in this

958
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,780
uh in this screenshot you can see we

959
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,300
could find that it was using couchbase

960
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,599
or JBoss or other typical web framework

961
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,619
to provide the API services so yes the

962
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,240
web application firewall should be a

963
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,700
security measure but frequently its own

964
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,060
errors would even disclose some

965
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,599
interesting informations

966
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,700
finally also the firewalls would

967
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,119
Overlook the detecting injection on

968
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,240
specific user control parameters because

969
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,060
it considered parameters such as the MC

970
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,200
the ICC ID as trusted while as you could

971
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,720
send a request even via curl command you

972
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,060
could modify them so this is very bad

973
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,460
because as all web Technologies you

974
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,700
should never trust user input so this is

975
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,460
one thing plus it was also we've seen

976
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,960
that these security settings were

977
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,780
inconsistent as I was saying before we

978
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,720
could inject script via apis and then

979
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,520
trigger them on the web portal but the

980
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,500
opposite was also true

981
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,320
so with this I conclude I leave the

982
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,540
stage back to altaf who will talk more

983
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,180
about the exploits that we did and the

984
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,240
Telco related vulnerabilities

985
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,900
okay so I'm gonna wrap up a bit quicker

986
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,760
but still if you are interested in

987
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,260
specific vulnerabilities like that I'm

988
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,060
gonna show that just catch me up after

989
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,119
the talk so uh some of the classic Telco

990
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,680
attacks that we actually tried as well

991
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,420
so from the devices like that we have

992
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,760
divertic devices we try to we try to

993
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,740
like scan the network and see if we can

994
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,140
find any exposed devices so we did that

995
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,579
and then we could in one of the

996
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,500
operators like we could find some of the

997
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,780
their production devices that actually

998
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,000
exposed so and then we could attempt to

999
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
log in but this is

1000
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,180
um an operator that we are closely

1001
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,859
associated so I cannot talk more about

1002
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,280
that but besides like I said in the

1003
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Platforms in or in the apis one of the

1004
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
major issue was with using uh permanent

1005
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,260
identifiers or the private identifiers

1006
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,480
of the SIM cards so you can basically I

1007
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,460
mean first of all like this will like

1008
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,320
you want to get a date of some some

1009
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,960
device so you basically have to insert

1010
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,359
an IMEI or emcee in the API and then

1011
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,460
send the request so this will basically

1012
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,579
allow on like encourage anyone to do

1013
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,619
enumeration because the emcees or the

1014
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,420
iccaries are like some kind of standard

1015
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,280
numbers that you can basically guess out

1016
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,960
of the platform so like I said if you

1017
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,280
are part of the platform you get access

1018
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,280
you get some SIM cards and then you can

1019
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,660
um let's say

1020
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,579
um guess what is the emcee of your

1021
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,380
target let's say the provider or like

1022
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,000
the the Target customer that you are

1023
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,380
looking for

1024
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,339
um

1025
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,599
okay

1026
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,339
um some of the another big vulnerability

1027
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,220
was uh we were able to send IP messages

1028
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,500
or it doesn't have to be IP messages but

1029
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,000
any kind of like random messages to

1030
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,339
arbitrary devices that are connected to

1031
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,740
the same platform so we found an issue

1032
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,420
with the authorization like while

1033
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,460
sending an IP message so there was no

1034
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,200
proper authorization check that was done

1035
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,060
which actually allowed us to Ping a lot

1036
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,460
of devices that are connected to or like

1037
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,040
that belong to another industry not just

1038
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,140
ping but we could also do port scan on

1039
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,640
these devices and then a lot of other

1040
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,920
attacks that could also be done but we

1041
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,660
restrained like not to do such attacks

1042
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,400
because like we wanted to first of all

1043
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,140
like inform the operator or like about

1044
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,300
this issue so that they could get it of

1045
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,040
it because this would be the extent of

1046
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,380
it like once you can capture the iot

1047
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,880
devices of someone else like I mean

1048
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
that's the end of the let's say the

1049
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
whole story

1050
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,700
um besides that we also found some very

1051
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,859
very interesting issues in other

1052
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,380
providers such as the private details

1053
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,119
such as I mean everybody knows that SIM

1054
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,240
card has a pin it has a book or

1055
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,220
um besides that there are also like

1056
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,680
billing details and so on so the issue

1057
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,960
was like you like I said you can

1058
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,180
actually use the API to send an SMS to

1059
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,400
the device and I don't know how many of

1060
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,599
you are actually aware of something

1061
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,700
called webhook webhook is like a place

1062
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,500
where you in the API is like you can

1063
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,540
issue a URL to the web hook and then it

1064
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,180
would update real-time information about

1065
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,940
the API traffic that is going on so like

1066
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,520
so we inserted a URL into the web hook

1067
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,359
so and then whenever we send an SMS we

1068
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,460
we programmed in such a way that okay we

1069
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,320
would like to get back a response like

1070
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,300
an SMS is sent and then we want to have

1071
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,940
a response that SMS was delivered or it

1072
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,400
was not delivered so this was some kind

1073
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,099
of a practice that we were following but

1074
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,160
what we saw that in this SMS response

1075
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,520
not only we receive the SMS was

1076
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,020
delivered but there was extra

1077
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,880
information not not even extra but like

1078
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,040
over extra information that was being

1079
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,820
trans sent back to the attacker so not

1080
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,619
uh so it's basically the details

1081
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,020
internal details of the SIM card uh like

1082
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,839
the pin Poke Plus some of the key

1083
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,180
information is what is the industry name

1084
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,060
organization ID like which is a what are

1085
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,520
the core Network entities that this

1086
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,339
particular devices are connected to

1087
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,020
like pretty much a lot of information is

1088
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,880
actually present or like leaked to the

1089
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
attacker I mean this is a serious issue

1090
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,859
because it just really

1091
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,200
um shouldn't be like that I mean when we

1092
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,060
communicated this to The Operators or

1093
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,760
like the vendors they said that it was

1094
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,619
particularly requested by one of their

1095
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:25,079
customers but what happens is like they

1096
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,780
try to apply such a such a request from

1097
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,280
a specific customer they generically

1098
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,440
apply to everyone because until we

1099
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,060
investigated like we couldn't find this

1100
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,820
issue so it actually affects all the

1101
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,820
users of the of the platform and they

1102
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,800
are unaware of it because unless you

1103
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
test it you don't know that something is

1104
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
like this then another interesting thing

1105
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,700
we tried to see was like can we spread

1106
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,500
malware through the mobile network so we

1107
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,599
try to insert a very known popular

1108
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,940
malware into the SMS and then they send

1109
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,460
it to the iot devices that we have what

1110
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,500
happens is like what we expect is that

1111
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,000
because this is a quite known popular

1112
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
malware we expect that operator would

1113
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,780
actually filter it and then don't send

1114
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,300
this to the device but we see that like

1115
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,560
none of the operators are like 10 of

1116
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,000
them we tested like don't really care

1117
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,099
about what's there in the content and

1118
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,480
then they try they deliver it to the

1119
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,460
device when we convert this to some

1120
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,500
operator like some of them they said was

1121
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,300
that some countries don't actually allow

1122
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,760
to investigate to look into the SMS

1123
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,740
content or like IP content but some they

1124
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,740
do but they don't care about uh what is

1125
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,780
inside the content I mean when we go go

1126
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,640
to different conferences like we see

1127
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,280
different uh companies like boasting

1128
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,020
about they have this kind of feature out

1129
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,640
they detect this kind of malware but

1130
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,800
when we test them in reality we don't

1131
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,960
really see these features being used or

1132
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,300
not sure maybe they have it but they

1133
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,280
don't activate them

1134
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,440
um then coming with the excesses

1135
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,520
protection I mean I think everybody

1136
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,260
knows this kind of attack so still

1137
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,420
observing them in 5G platforms it's

1138
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,619
quite

1139
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,359
um like not really a nice thing because

1140
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,400
these attacks are something easy to

1141
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,380
easily they can be done I mean you don't

1142
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,839
really need to learn a lot to pull out

1143
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,000
like an excessive attack and we were

1144
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,700
able to successfully inject uh code into

1145
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,500
many platforms and one of them we could

1146
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,020
actually execute it so that we we could

1147
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,819
read some of the internals of the

1148
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,700
platform or the API server let's say

1149
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,260
um okay so these are some of the issues

1150
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,180
that we actually found in uh some of the

1151
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,480
latest iot platforms we did try to get

1152
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,240
SIM cards in India as well but I think I

1153
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,700
was physically not present here so it

1154
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,500
was difficult to get SIM cards and then

1155
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,060
try out these attacks in India as well

1156
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,940
so we focused much of them in Europe and

1157
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,300
USA as well so just to summarize

1158
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,520
um we see that oauth and then TLS though

1159
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,020
it is a standard recommended practice

1160
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,960
not really widely practiced then only

1161
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,960
two of uh like nine platforms that we

1162
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,339
tested are actually affected with the

1163
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,599
serious vulnerabilities that you saw

1164
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,280
here

1165
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,260
then lack of rate limits and then strong

1166
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,240
password policies are like quite seen

1167
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,420
everywhere script injection is also like

1168
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,400
a big issue that we found in many

1169
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,339
platforms then besides not inspecting

1170
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,099
SMS or IP content even though it has a

1171
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,680
malware is is already like an issue in

1172
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,700
in the whole in many platforms

1173
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,859
um yes we did inform all the vendors and

1174
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,859
then also we went through the gsma as

1175
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,900
well to to see if we can reach out to

1176
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,700
more operators so this was successfully

1177
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,260
received or like well received I would

1178
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,000
say because this is already a quite new

1179
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,859
research like API research and I think

1180
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:27,839
it can actually set some kind of

1181
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,640
standards in the Telco industry like how

1182
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,160
not to configure the apis

1183
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,339
oh okay so some key takeaways is that

1184
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,740
definitely like 5G security is much

1185
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,400
better than uh 4G or what a 3g2g offer

1186
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,920
as well but given that these close

1187
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,480
networks are now shifting towards like

1188
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,280
commoditized Hardware such as using

1189
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
clouds or apis I think this makes it

1190
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,119
more attractive for the attacker and

1191
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,920
then tries to pull more adversaries to

1192
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,540
attack mobile network so I think it's

1193
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,660
more important to to be to consider like

1194
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,520
security as a higher priority and then

1195
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,540
like

1196
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,079
um or like use more resources or tools

1197
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,900
to to make security I think more like a

1198
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,540
higher priority in mobile networks

1199
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,240
um like I said one single API uh

1200
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,980
insecure API can actually take over

1201
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,260
allow like attackers to take over the

1202
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,940
iot devices and also the whole network

1203
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,119
as well and firewalls like we saw most

1204
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,619
of them had firewalls but they didn't

1205
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,420
really help or detect simple injection

1206
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,040
attacks so what are we talking about

1207
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,859
like then security by Design is

1208
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,960
something I think quite it should be in

1209
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,640
a sense or like a fundamental practice

1210
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,640
that most of them should follow

1211
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,380
actually this research maybe could

1212
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,060
actually open up to something called

1213
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,800
Telecom API top 10 because I think

1214
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,380
everybody saw that oasp API top 10 but

1215
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,079
Telecom API top 10 is something that

1216
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,359
will come out in some years I would say

1217
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,240
so it definitely will have operators and

1218
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,480
then anybody like who is willing to use

1219
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,520
5G networks to actually understand what

1220
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,280
are the risks that actually come with

1221
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,900
apis in Telecom

1222
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,240
with this I conclude the talk and then

1223
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,740
if you have some questions comments I

1224
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,200
mean I'm sorry like we crossed the time

1225
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,720
limit a bit but if you have some

1226
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,819
questions please shoot

1227
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,480
all right

1228
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:22,579
any one question

1229
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,740
so uh you said you can update the

1230
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,900
private key or the master key of SM

1231
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,599
right so what would be the attack path

1232
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,440
if I could have that capability so

1233
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,660
uh the attack path would be like I mean

1234
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,280
once you have so you know your target

1235
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,020
let's say you just need to find out the

1236
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,540
NC of the Target and then use the

1237
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,940
insecure API and update the key so once

1238
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,980
this is done the operator will take care

1239
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,859
of updating the key on the SIM card this

1240
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,920
is done remotely and here after like you

1241
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,260
can you basically can listen to any kind

1242
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,060
of conversation that this SIM card is

1243
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,160
making Hereafter because you know like

1244
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,720
the keys and then maybe you need some

1245
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,339
extra material such as like

1246
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,960
authentication parameters or something

1247
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,180
so here after you can you have the

1248
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,920
master key you can basically derive all

1249
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,680
the subsequent session keys to to just

1250
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,839
listen to any conversation or decode any

1251
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:14,760
SMS that you have or like if you're

1252
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,560
looking for a specific Target

1253
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,740
foreign

1254
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,680
first of all a very great talk I really

1255
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,500
enjoyed that uh so my question is so I

1256
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,960
checked that uh you exploited the xss in

1257
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,300
the management platform to for arbitrary

1258
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,839
script execution right so but uh I

1259
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,160
didn't understand the code execution

1260
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,800
part can we also achieve arbitrary code

1261
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,040
execution uh yes yeah how

1262
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,960
um it's basically like you when we try

1263
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,420
to inject a specific in a specific

1264
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,339
parameter I mean I think I'm not showing

1265
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:55,560
the exact parameter because it's

1266
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,780
different for uh different let's say

1267
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,220
it's different for different operator

1268
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,440
because the the apis are different for

1269
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,079
different operators so generically like

1270
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,839
we could Target something called Elias

1271
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,420
Elias is a parameter that it's like a

1272
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,599
pseudo name that is given to be used

1273
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,000
instead of MC or IMEI so in many

1274
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,280
platforms we found that Les is a

1275
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,319
parameter we can inject and then this is

1276
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,760
basically stored inside the platform

1277
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,079
Hereafter

1278
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:22,920
um

1279
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,500
when along with this one if you can pull

1280
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,300
out the authorization vulnerability that

1281
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,160
I showed before while sending the IP

1282
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,619
address like I mean there was no

1283
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,880
authorization check so when you combine

1284
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,619
both of them you can actually execute

1285
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,319
directly on the server or you can inject

1286
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,839
this and then let your cost or like the

1287
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,760
Target customer the target industry

1288
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,560
let's say once they open this one

1289
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,180
because it's basically stored inside the

1290
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,660
server so once they open a web interface

1291
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,640
like this you can execute code directly

1292
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,680
on someone else's

1293
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,940
um yeah interface

1294
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,060
anyone else

1295
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,099
hello

1296
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,140
uh to start off with I really enjoyed

1297
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,560
your talk just so that uh I I noticed

1298
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,040
that the very basic point to actually

1299
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,079
perform this kind of assessment is to

1300
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,579
actually build a business relationship

1301
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,380
as you mentioned can you can you be a

1302
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,359
bit louder please am I audible no yeah

1303
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,119
yeah so what I noticed was that the very

1304
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,339
base Point as in the first thing a

1305
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,079
prerequisite to perform this kind of

1306
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,420
assessment is to have relationship with

1307
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,520
the service provider as you mentioned so

1308
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,920
how easy or difficult was it in your

1309
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,900
case to actually get access to those

1310
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,579
service providers once you had got

1311
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,619
access to the SIM cards I would do SIM

1312
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,540
cards The Next Step how easy or

1313
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,619
difficult

1314
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:44,940
um yeah like I said getting the access

1315
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,040
because you need to buy the SIM card

1316
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,260
which costs like maybe 15 or something

1317
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,440
not not that big

1318
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,560
but the funny part was like because

1319
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,900
like I said this procedure of buying the

1320
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,300
SIM cards you have to submit your tax ID

1321
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,099
or your company certificate like a basic

1322
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,440
one corporate ID and then after that

1323
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,940
it's it's quite easy like they would

1324
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,980
directly ship the SIM cards because I

1325
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,660
think these procedures are not hardened

1326
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,579
yet like for example you go to your shop

1327
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,160
by yourself and then you submit your you

1328
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,359
know you want to buy a SIM card like

1329
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,579
Airtel or jio so they will let you take

1330
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,560
you and then check your ID and you know

1331
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,020
like there's a I think I don't say

1332
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,520
strict but there is sufficient

1333
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,980
verification procedure in this case but

1334
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,020
in the in the SIM cards that we obtained

1335
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,819
it was basically online like you just

1336
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,680
have to submit all the documents online

1337
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,020
maybe they verify or they may not verify

1338
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,540
and then after that the SIM cards will

1339
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,160
be shipped to the to the address that

1340
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,740
you gave the funny part is like

1341
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,000
um because I'm from the University like

1342
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,859
you know we always used our University

1343
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:46,500
ID or something now to buy the SIM cards

1344
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,319
but during covet time like nobody was

1345
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,180
going to the university we were staying

1346
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,220
home and then we always use our private

1347
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,079
addresses to ship the SIM cards so which

1348
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:57,359
means that in this case if you forge

1349
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,240
some tax ID and then provide some random

1350
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,520
address you can basically obtain SIM

1351
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,740
cards on somebody else's name or

1352
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,839
somebody on a different company's name I

1353
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,099
mean you can basically take any company

1354
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,859
name and then some text ID is something

1355
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,300
like a public information that's

1356
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,400
available in Europe I guess here as well

1357
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,280
so it's it was quite easy but beside

1358
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,780
after that then

1359
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,220
studying the API is a little bit

1360
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,280
understanding what you can do with that

1361
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,619
plus some API knowledge with like with

1362
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,000
the tools and all this stuff like I

1363
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,859
think there was I don't say like it was

1364
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,119
quite difficult like that's why I'm

1365
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,099
telling like it's not that difficult but

1366
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,200
it took a lot of time to look into nine

1367
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,359
platforms and see how each of them

1368
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,280
configure and then differently so

1369
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,940
awesome thanks for the answer and lastly

1370
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,579
this was all the testing was performed

1371
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,859
in the European region right Europe and

1372
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,500
USA and Middle East as well awesome

1373
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,280
thank you

1374
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,800
just just as an addition uh this the

1375
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,599
easiness in getting the SIM card was

1376
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,099
probably due to the fact that the

1377
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,660
operators were launching this new

1378
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,700
service so they were quite eager to get

1379
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,040
as many new customers as possible so

1380
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,200
that's why it currently probably not a

1381
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,020
hardened procedure so

1382
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,960
yeah one question uh how can we sniff

1383
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,000
the 5G communication

1384
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,339
sorry how can we sniff the 5G

1385
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:18,480
communication

1386
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,339
how can you snip the 5G token

1387
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:24,359
communication ah yeah

1388
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:27,119
okay this is

1389
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,339
maybe I mean we will have a talk on this

1390
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,700
on in 2023 maybe yeah

1391
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,099
but okay you're saying like how to sniff

1392
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,740
5G communication like same as 4G because

1393
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,960
on the radio side there hasn't been much

1394
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,480
change but I mean of course like 5G is a

1395
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,020
different physical layer compared to 4G

1396
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,240
you might just need a different SD Alex

1397
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,220
same SDR but with a different software

1398
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,079
to snip the whole 5G communication okay

1399
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,880
but the problem is like it could be

1400
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,000
completely encrypted or or even the in C

1401
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,980
if I don't know if you read a bit of 5G

1402
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,900
you will already learn that there is

1403
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,420
something called Suchi an encrypted MC

1404
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,640
so this makes it a little bit difficult

1405
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,119
on the radio side and but the the thing

1406
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,099
is like the other paths are getting much

1407
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,780
easier like not easier but more

1408
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,280
interesting for example like the apis

1409
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,200
yeah I know the radio part like I did a

1410
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,540
lot of things there but now also like

1411
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,220
makes me boring that I mean I cannot sit

1412
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,780
there for a long time I need to explore

1413
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,520
different parts so that's why we took

1414
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,500
from another Direction like from the

1415
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,059
other side of the network but

1416
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:30,300
intercepting 5G communication maybe you

1417
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,099
could still use 2G network as well I

1418
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,339
mean this is a classic technique that

1419
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,720
many devices use or like many

1420
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,680
interception systems use yeah in such

1421
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,740
cases I like how we can access the API

1422
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,950
from the 4G direct access

1423
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:46,440
[Music]

1424
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,359
um

1425
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,559
you need to have a contract with the

1426
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,780
provider like I mean okay you could

1427
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,400
individually I think it's difficult

1428
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,559
because it already raises a suspicion

1429
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,900
like why you need SIM cards like you

1430
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,300
don't have an infrastructure they would

1431
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,119
maybe feel more comfortable maybe you

1432
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,619
can ask some Airtel guys or like you

1433
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,839
know some other operator guys like

1434
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,559
um to give you a bunch of SIM cards and

1435
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,440
then you can play with them like okay

1436
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,599
but I don't think this API I think

1437
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,180
doesn't require the SIM cards I'm sorry

1438
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,520
can you repeat it uh what I'm saying

1439
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,980
like without SIM cards we access this

1440
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,859
apis yes it's also possible because all

1441
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:28,020
of these apis are publicly you know like

1442
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,359
because they want to show

1443
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:31,559
um all the operators want to Market

1444
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,420
their platform like they show a basic

1445
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,760
look of their API and most of them you

1446
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,619
can you know what is inside the API but

1447
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:38,880
to use them you need some kind of

1448
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,339
credential yeah um maybe you can break

1449
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,500
the authentication that's the quite

1450
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,119
simplest way

1451
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,280
um if you do that then yeah you don't

1452
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,780
need any kind of business contract then

1453
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,079
you're on the platform and yeah

1454
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,579
yeah

1455
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,780
thank you thank you
