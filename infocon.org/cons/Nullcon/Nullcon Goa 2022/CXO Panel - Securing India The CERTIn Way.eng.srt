1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:07,439
uh as part of TCS operations there and

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
shaped a lot of policies he's also been

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,780
a great influence continues to be in the

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,099
government of India in a number of

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,460
security related uh decision-making

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,619
bodies where he advises the government

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,779
while also managing certain to a large

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,320
extent and part of the reason is we are

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,840
here is again thanks to him because of

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,320
the recent notifications which has we've

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,000
seen a lot of regulatory work happening

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,440
in the certain space for the information

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,719
security community so we'll use that

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,880
framework for today's discussion then

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,219
there is anuprita Daga you must have

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,559
heard her yesterday some excellent

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,719
sessions that she was in and she was

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,500
also talking about csos and the kind of

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,840
stuff that they can do she's also done

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,340
something very unique which is put

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,460
together almost two thousand

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,840
csos and information security people

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,539
together because this is a concept which

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,460
is very close to my heart that if if

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,860
your adversary is united in some ways

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,659
then why the defense cannot be

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,760
disjointed we have to be equally

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
connected to each other speak to each

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,260
other so the good guys have to be as

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,360
well connected amongst themselves as the

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
Bad actors and therefore she's been

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,939
doing a lot of work besides her work as

33
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,520
CSO of yes bank and again she's been

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,740
almost 20 years in the CSO information

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,740
security leadership space besides a

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,000
longer career in the information

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
security space and then of course we

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,799
have Mr Ajit Menon he's ciso TCS and old

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,040
colleague of Dr behal again many years

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,500
almost a decade Plus in major leadership

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,479
positions in the information security

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,759
he's also a business leader he's set up

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,000
centers globally and he also deals with

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,399
a lot of regulatory complexities from a

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,799
Global Perspective so we hope to learn a

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,860
lot from him just a few quick opening

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,159
words cyber security as we keep talking

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,460
about is a very complex and shared

49
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,280
responsibility so there will be a lot of

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,318
positioning from the government of India

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,840
because they have to protect the nation

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,780
from one perspective and also we don't

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,060
know who the adversary is the adversary

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,040
could be a non-state actor the adversary

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,260
could be a state actor wanting to create

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,319
trouble in important institutions like

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,780
yes bank or TCS because if they can take

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,060
out one or two institutions that's a

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,459
huge blow to India's national security

60
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,280
and its Economic Security so there are

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
different perspectives that have to come

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,420
in somebody like ajits will be working a

63
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,400
lot dealing with similar kind of

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,140
challenges and Regulatory issues in

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,239
various other companies so a lot of that

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,180
experience can feedback as a loop into

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,940
our national posture which again will be

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,640
very important and anuprita handles the

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,860
bfsi sector and she's got decades and

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,480
Decades of experience in that sector

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,580
which again is one of the most critical

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,440
information infrastructures which we

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,160
heard about yesterday from dgnciopc so

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,620
that's the format that we are looking at

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,980
I'll request uh all the opening speakers

76
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,140
to have their opening remarks for five

77
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,360
minutes and we will start with

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,300
discussing the certain notifications and

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,879
what was the intent behind it when I

80
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,340
spoke to Dr behel I realized that there

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,900
is a lot of miscommunication floating

82
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,300
around and those notifications are

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,980
actually supposed to be helping all of

84
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,900
you do the work that you do as

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,599
organizations and as individuals in the

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
infosec space so let's hear Dr behel and

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,739
the others and then we'll have a more

88
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,340
interactive session so thank you for

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,340
these very kind words and good afternoon

90
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,120
to all of you

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
he's literally gone and

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,459
built up a lot of expectations amongst

93
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,400
everyone so I hope we can uh

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,940
live up to those but having said that

95
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,640
you know there's a huge amount of

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,220
after covet digital transformation which

97
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,080
is happening in the society government

98
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,840
as well as industry

99
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,500
and I made sure that this

100
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,420
cyber infrastructure becomes borderless

101
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,459
for all to thrive

102
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,880
but also generate huge volume of data

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,680
and this

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,340
has attracted a lot of attackers

105
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,020
criminals Etc

106
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,479
and also as increase the attack surface

107
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,780
you all come across

108
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,720
incidence of solar winds Colonial

109
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,320
pipeline

110
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,440
all of them show that industrial matured

111
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,979
and we all are deeply interconnected

112
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,960
and are now susceptible to

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,900
vulnerabilities on a global scale

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,720
but our ability to handle risks

115
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
and incidence is not at the desired

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
place

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
and you've seen with all these incidents

118
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
which are happening but so what's the

119
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,860
sort of threat landscape that we are

120
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,880
actually seen

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,000
psychat mentioned about ransomware I

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,580
don't know how many of you have seen the

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,500
H1 2022 report which has been put up on

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,199
the certain website anyone seen it not

125
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,000
seen it aware of it

126
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,220
hello

127
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,580
need coffee

128
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,759
okay you have seen it so you've said

129
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,979
that there has been a 51 percent

130
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,340
increase uh compared to

131
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,179
2021

132
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,400
you are seeing malware we are seeing

133
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,660
targeted fishing there is obviously

134
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,900
apt's data breaches and leaks there's

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,199
also uh fake apps unauthorized access to

136
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,139
social media and digital payment threats

137
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,120
which are increasing

138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,539
what are these uh

139
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,820
actors malicious actors doing they're

140
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,740
using binaries which are already

141
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,050
available

142
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,240
[Music]

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,940
in the Target environment rather than

144
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,880
deploying custom tools and malware for

145
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,039
example they're using any disk for

146
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,199
remote Administration

147
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,660
they're using NG Rock reverse proxy

148
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,180
applications to maintain persistence

149
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,860
so we've seen all these sort of

150
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,139
incidents which are happening in fact

151
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,900
last year a cert handle

152
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,259
one incident every 30 seconds

153
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,300
so you can imagine the volume that we

154
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,979
are handling

155
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,759
and we gave out advisories

156
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,740
one per day three advisories

157
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,919
which is huge making an advisory is not

158
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,900
easy you have to go through a whole lot

159
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,080
of details

160
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,539
look at what will work or not work

161
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,479
should not break systems Etc and then

162
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,100
publish them

163
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,440
so publishing three advisories per day

164
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,199
handling one incident every 30 seconds

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,720
is humongous task

166
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,240
and these are all the sort of threat

167
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,740
environment which I mentioned you're

168
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,259
seeing none of them are connected

169
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,180
they are all different type of skills

170
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
that are required to handle these

171
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,380
so it's mind-boggling when a person is

172
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,120
sitting and trying to handle and you are

173
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,099
expecting someone to handle more than

174
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,060
one type of incident

175
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,380
but that does not mean we have a huge

176
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,479
Army of people doing all this huh don't

177
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,859
get that impression

178
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,220
let me take some cases since uh

179
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,080
mentioned that

180
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
what made you come out with these sort

181
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,139
of directions

182
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,419
see we've seen incidents where

183
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,419
the victims

184
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,479
in their ICT environment installation of

185
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,340
new software has happened but they are

186
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,139
not even aware of it

187
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,880
okay

188
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,039
because there is no auditing there's no

189
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
monitoring mechanism

190
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,099
there are no logs being kept

191
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,039
people have used VPN and logged in from

192
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,800
outside India these are not detected and

193
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
there is no reason for anyone in that

194
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,940
environment to log in from outside India

195
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,979
we've seen Brute Force attempts and

196
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,559
these were not captured group policies

197
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,500
were being modified after compromising

198
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,719
the domain users and all this was

199
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,500
undetected

200
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,200
so you know seeing all these things is

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,820
not just one incident two incidents

202
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,800
we've been seeing this for the last few

203
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,860
years and then we thought you know let's

204
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,080
get to the root cause

205
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,720
one of the issues everyone has been

206
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,320
raising was about reporting of incidents

207
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,120
which you said six hours

208
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,880
if you look at

209
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,220
the itac

210
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,459
it already says report incidence in a

211
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,260
reasonable time frame though that action

212
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,120
can be taken

213
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,100
now when you start

214
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,339
you know we all have the ISD

215
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,399
Indian stretchable time

216
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
so when you start stretching what is

217
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,980
written with the right intention

218
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,899
then there's a challenge

219
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,680
now reasonable time frame people started

220
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,480
informing or reporting

221
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,120
after six months after one year

222
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,740
is that acceptable

223
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,740
is that a reasonable time frame

224
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,660
I can understand you give it to me after

225
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,420
one day two days so that

226
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,060
as Michael mentioned this is all a team

227
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,320
sport

228
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,180
if it is a team sport and if you have to

229
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,580
cook collaborate to cooperate Etc how

230
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,480
are we going to collaborate and

231
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,040
cooperate

232
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,620
if you're not going to inform brush it

233
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,399
under the carpet obviously the other

234
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,500
entities are not going to be aware of it

235
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,260
no one can protect themselves so one

236
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,680
after the other everyone starts falling

237
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
is that acceptable

238
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,240
so you know we saw all these sort of

239
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,260
gaps now there was some incident uh

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,240
I said we don't have a huge Army of

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,940
people so normally I would

242
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,760
be leaving office around

243
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,000
9 30 10 so it's if you people think that

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,620
being in the government one can go home

245
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,519
at five

246
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,100
change your impressions about that it's

247
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,260
not no longer like that

248
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,399
so

249
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,220
I gotta get a call from someone at nine

250
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,519
that we are seeing a huge

251
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,720
attack

252
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,760
uh sort of stuff happening and they

253
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,040
might it was in the financial sector and

254
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
there might be huge amount of

255
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
money that might be lost

256
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,720
we don't know how to reach out to that

257
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,300
particular entity can you help us

258
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,180
so if you have a point of contact

259
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,640
obviously you can immediately reach out

260
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,459
to those persons and take action we had

261
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,680
a point of contact reached out

262
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,180
fortunately they were doing some

263
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,120
reconciliations they were in office he

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
told them what is happening can you

265
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,980
immediately look into your systems and

266
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,440
see what is happening and revert back

267
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,959
within 15 minutes everything was taken

268
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,760
care of they said yes this was something

269
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,100
happening thank you for alerting us

270
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,160
we've taken action we checked back are

271
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
you still seeing this they said no it

272
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,060
has stopped so within a span of about

273
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,360
half an hour everything was

274
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,060
taken care of so that's why we said you

275
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,680
have to provide us with the point of

276
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,079
contacts if you do not give point of

277
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,579
contacts whom am I going to reach out to

278
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,380
how am I going to take care and

279
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,000
Safeguard you

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,920
and if you expect that no we should be

281
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,079
taking care and safeguarding if you

282
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,720
don't provide such details so just now

283
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,579
also when I was walking in here someone

284
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,740
said we are just wondering as to who

285
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,060
should be the point of contact I say

286
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,519
what is there to wonder in this I said

287
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,740
you just tell me whoever we can pick up

288
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,500
the phone and talk to 24 7 that person

289
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,180
should be the point of contact

290
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,220
and whatever language that sir talks if

291
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,959
it is a technical language that person

292
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,399
should understand that that's about it

293
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,959
nothing more than that

294
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,959
it's nothing complex

295
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,620
then there was a issue I Believe on

296
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,880
uh vpns Etc

297
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,860
so

298
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,700
how many of you here have uh

299
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,740
given your

300
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,360
house on rent

301
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,959
anyone

302
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,139
quite a few okay so when you give on

303
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,339
rent

304
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,680
do you do background verification checks

305
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,079
inform the police that so and so because

306
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,279
those are some guidelines which have

307
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,320
come from uh the ministry of Home

308
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,820
Affairs saying that you should report

309
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,540
whoever is your tenant and uh

310
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,120
check the antecedents Etc do you do

311
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
those

312
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,740
yes

313
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,480
what we have seen the data centers Etc

314
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,820
are giving out services

315
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,160
they have no clue

316
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,839
what

317
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,040
it is being used for

318
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,040
now if you rented out a place and if the

319
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,500
person inside there happens to be a

320
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,480
terrorist

321
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,180
says there makes the bombs takes it out

322
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,200
in the

323
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,180
physical space

324
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,519
and then never returns back

325
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,440
and when you start tracing and you come

326
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,680
to this house a law enforcement what are

327
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,219
you going to do

328
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,700
catch the owner right

329
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
so when we are seeing such incidents

330
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,639
when we trace it back do our analysis

331
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,100
and you catch the owner they say yes we

332
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,480
have rented this out

333
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,540
but we have no clue who have we rented

334
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,019
this out to

335
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,740
so this is where the challenge starts

336
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,800
that's why we said you have to have kyc

337
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,139
for all this and

338
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,279


339
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
well ransomware everything is being

340
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,579
demanded in crypto

341
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,740
so that's why this issue of crypto came

342
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,320
in so with that that's the background of

343
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,579
how these

344
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,100
directions were given I hope that gives

345
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,540
you some flavor as to what's happening

346
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,000
what's not happening what do you say so

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,980
I I was going to ask him a few more

348
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,560
questions but sir sort of preempted me

349
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,300
and gave the answers before I could post

350
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
them but just to give you a background

351
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,180
like

352
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,279
some of many of you are csos here but

353
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,839
some of you will at some point become

354
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,019
cxos and csos why the regulatory

355
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,699
environment is very important is because

356
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,620
to understand it from their perspective

357
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,779
they have a large mandate and they have

358
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,000
a large responsibility and they won't be

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
able to do it unless there is some

360
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,839
enforcement like if you are expecting

361
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,120
somebody expecting them to protect

362
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,980
somebody but they will take reasonable

363
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,079
time as one year obviously that's they

364
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,180
won't be able to do their job so that

365
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,160
that sensitivity needs to be understood

366
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,260
when you understand the kind of role

367
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,480
certain plays and there is a lot of

368
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
material that's already available not

369
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,540
only on their website if you look at

370
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,339
what cyberswatch Kendra is trying to do

371
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,779
again you will get to a lot of

372
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,300
information and many csos I think 700

373
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,100
plus csos are already connected to you

374
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,660
where through a sticks taxi format

375
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,060
they're giving back a lot of threat

376
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,740
intelligence and now the threat

377
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,180
intelligence is being recognized

378
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,100
globally as some of the best feeds

379
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
itself so this is a work in progress and

380
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
there are of course questions and I'll

381
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,100
be raising some questions here but there

382
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,019
is a lot of good that is happening now

383
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,019
the bfsi sector is a very matured sector

384
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,360
in that sense and it's dealt with these

385
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,820
threats for a long time how do you see

386
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,579
be certain as a as a as an end user and

387
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,980
who has to comply with some of these and

388
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,440
how much do you think this will help you

389
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,680
as a CSO in the sector that you're in so

390
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,560
uh I think question of how much it will

391
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,620
help is obviously if you see like in my

392
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,880
introduction you talk about the

393
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,860
collaboration right I mean and

394
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,540
government and it is good that at

395
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,860
government level there are a lot of

396
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,420
proactive actions which are happening

397
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,760
and those proactive actions let's say

398
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,079
that you know whether it is a

399
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,060
manufacturing company or any other bank

400
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,360
or any other BFI sector and the way the

401
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
crunching on ioc and uh suggested as he

402
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,220
said that okay when we are issuing The

403
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,380
Advisory or alert then definitely there

404
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,360
is lot of work which is happening and

405
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,699
obviously that relevant is coming to us

406
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,880
and we ourselves have also seen because

407
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,579
it's a very one is the bank says and

408
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,680
then other csos also there is quite a

409
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
good small salt Pockets where people are

410
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,459
connected and when something happens at

411
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,579
least we take help of each other and I

412
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,920
myself has experience in last three four

413
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,959
years saying that you know when when

414
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,759
there is either we have reported or

415
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,059
somebody has reported and four to six

416
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,099
hours that was also in the industry in

417
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,839
banking four to six hours is very normal

418
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,880
because we are doing it for a long time

419
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,160
but for other than banking I think that

420
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,260
is one thing which where people fit and

421
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,380
Sr said like six months one year you

422
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,380
know maybe one day two days but we

423
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,480
ourselves have seen that you know after

424
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,059
reporting it you know this is quite a

425
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,520
bit of work which happens and the same

426
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,919
thing as a advisory which comes to all

427
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,480
the banking side right and there's a lot

428
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,460
of coordination and it's not only

429
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,880
certain from Sir to Seaside to RBI to

430
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,740
other regulator there is quite a good

431
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,600
collaboration also which happens which

432
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,679
we experience it and how does that help

433
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,960
us proactively like when I'm giving it

434
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,020
it is helping like all other 200 300

435
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,179
banks at the same time when somebody is

436
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,919
giving it definitely it is helping us

437
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,880
also so the whole system in one limited

438
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,400
pocket is really working very well and

439
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,760
we are a part of that uh and when that

440
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,860
is being extended to all the industries

441
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm sure that the threat Intel what we

442
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,940
have right now that will really be

443
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,640
multiple and India will have their own

444
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,340
in set Intel also and which we all will

445
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,200
be able to use that so from a

446
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
notification perspective you think this

447
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
is really helpful from us it's very very

448
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,679
helpful and now this has become such a

449
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,720
BAU now for us that when we get the

450
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,880
threat until obviously there is another

451
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,460
background process which you know we we

452
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,380
go ahead and do that because we have not

453
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,260
seen uh whether false quality or

454
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,679
irrelevant or anything like that so for

455
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,020
us it is very very helpful like it's a

456
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,960
very strong input which is coming to us

457
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,380
and thanks to the whole team for that uh

458
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,539
one is that that this whole threat Intel

459
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,240
and during pandemic right many times

460
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,220
this is also a good connect where

461
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,440
whenever we need something happening or

462
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,559
or you know some doubt you know and they

463
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,200
also have a point of contact where we

464
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,179
connect with them we take their guidance

465
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,960
or you know we also if there's anything

466
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,760
we discuss with them like what need to

467
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,720
be done I think this quite a bit

468
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,220
multi-fold collaboration which is

469
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,660
happening between the government and the

470
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,520
industry and also I think the

471
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,320
notifications have brought in a lot of

472
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
clarity where certain areas where that

473
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,280
Clarity was not there and if you see the

474
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,740
subsequent effect used there was a lot

475
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,679
of rethinking also which then brought

476
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,419
further clarification and I think it

477
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,580
also took some feedback to the initial

478
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,039
notifications and eased certain things

479
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,500
where they felt that yes some time needs

480
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,559
to do this yes definitely it is a lot of

481
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,799
things to us also and again in uh in the

482
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,559
CSO Forum of Banks and all we also got

483
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,980
the clarity on that uh for banking this

484
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,500
is like a normal right

485
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,980
for other industry it's a new Norm but

486
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,860
while making it new now for everything

487
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,080
which is starting is going to have

488
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,840
initial job and then obviously when they

489
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,820
get the visibility of that obviously

490
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,539
they will also understand the the

491
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,299
meaningful activity behind it so today

492
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,600
when uh sir was talking about uh

493
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,299
reasonable time period right why four to

494
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,240
six hours this is a reason for that and

495
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,940
that for reason to uh to see that okay

496
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,059
why quickly we need to report it because

497
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,780
for us it is containment within our

498
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,740
company

499
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,140
for hemp contentment within the country

500
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,539
country yes that that's a huge

501
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,600
difference right and uh I think once

502
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,520
people start you know seeing that whole

503
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,679
life cycle uh people will understand

504
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,900
okay why uh certain is talking about

505
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,880
four to six hours why certain is talking

506
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
about ntp your time synchronization by

507
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,940
certain is talking about log management

508
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,039
uh but yeah it's a cycle like they have

509
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,440
to if I am confident to talk about it

510
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,539
because I have experienced it if

511
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,760
everybody has to get that confidence

512
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,140
obviously they have to go through a red

513
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,679
life cycle Ajit you've seen a Global

514
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,240
Perspective right and you've dealt with

515
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,080
other search what what changed when the

516
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
note came and how does it compare with

517
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,780
the other search and how they operate in

518
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,360
the countries you have worked in

519
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,740
oh thanks

520
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,059
um that's an interesting question

521
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,539
because if you look at what cert India

522
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,520
is trying to do versus what others are

523
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,539
trying to do we do have a good amount of

524
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,460
threat Intel coming in now if I compare

525
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,720
it with can you hear us

526
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,620
he said okay hello

527
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,620
yeah okay so if I compare the threat

528
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,000
Intel we get in other geographies

529
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,559
because we connected in most of the

530
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,080
geographies where we operate um I can

531
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,940
tell you that the iocs that we receive

532
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,159
there are hardly like one tenth or less

533
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,140
um the actionable intelligence that we

534
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,700
get from cert in have really been

535
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,220
valuable we get threat Intel but the

536
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,919
importance is to get actionable

537
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,360
intelligence and that is what keeps you

538
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,340
a step ahead of your adversary so that's

539
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,780
something that really makes a big change

540
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,820
and that is I mean I would agree with

541
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,580
what uh on Twitter said the amount of

542
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,440
information that we get back from cert

543
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,080
obviously gives us the motivation to

544
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,780
report so that it helps not just us but

545
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,880
also others who are functioning and we

546
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,940
have to remember that um unlike maybe a

547
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,679
decade ago where each of us were

548
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,960
individual organizations today it is an

549
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,640
ecosystem in some way you are connected

550
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,260
like we are connected with a bank the

551
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,120
bank is connected with someone else and

552
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,740
that one is connected back to us so

553
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,559
unless we take that thought that we have

554
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,960
to protect the ecosystem you are never

555
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,240
protected so you have to move beyond the

556
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,679
boundaries of saying that I want to

557
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,419
protect my organizations it just cannot

558
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,100
be about yourself because you're no

559
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,860
longer an isolated entity in the larger

560
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,620
ecosystem the supply chain attacks that

561
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,419
we're talking about that today is the

562
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,460
biggest concern that exists most of our

563
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,320
customers talk about it like if

564
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,179
organization like you us which are

565
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,340
service providers are attacked and we do

566
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,320
not have the right protection they also

567
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,059
become partied to an attack right so

568
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,620
these are concerns which we keep hearing

569
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,179
from customers these are concerns that

570
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,860
we keep hearing from Regulators outside

571
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,860
with whom we uh discuss these issues so

572
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,780
the whole thing goes around in terms of

573
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,659
how quickly can we firstly identify how

574
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,400
quickly can we share and resolve it

575
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,620
collectively because it's not just a

576
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,240
one-person game anymore

577
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,760
so um if you talk about

578
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,159
um other Regulators we're not seeing

579
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,659
enforcement to the extent that we're

580
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:40,919
talking about but I think the need of

581
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,620
the r is that we get to that level so

582
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,299
that the sharing happens we have to look

583
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,460
beyond the demand but we have to

584
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,740
understand the underlying intent

585
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,659
okay so in that sense I would say that

586
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,659
so that intent part that you mentioned

587
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,360
is very interesting so if intent can be

588
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,299
established then without enforcement you

589
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,740
can probably get a lot of people to

590
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,320
agree to do some of these things so if

591
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,020
if you were to then say that if you

592
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,880
wanted to see the notifications as there

593
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,799
would you want to tweak anything in

594
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
those notifications today

595
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,240
uh okay so if you ask me if something

596
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,620
could have been done differently on

597
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,299
those notifications

598
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,580
um there are a few things which possibly

599
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,520
I may not be very convinced about

600
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
um first and foremost uh is let me go in

601
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,140
the sequence so that I I recall when we

602
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,200
talk about uh the sync time

603
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,419
synchronization to be done but that's a

604
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,460
given without that no investigations can

605
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,620
ever happen but uh

606
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,900
if I bring the practicality of trying to

607
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,679
say that every System including the

608
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,840
OT systems how to be time synchronized

609
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,179
to a particular clock okay that becomes

610
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,039
overbearing uh and I think it got

611
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,900
diluted a little later in the next thing

612
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,380
that it can be in line with it but

613
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,400
um

614
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,960
I I think we're gonna just stop by

615
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,220
saying you need to have time

616
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,799
synchronization right with the Nic and

617
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,360
pl could have been avoided because that

618
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,039
just brings in an additional layer like

619
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,720
today if there is an attack on company a

620
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,240
versus Company B you start with when it

621
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,520
started in company and your timeline is

622
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
from there on you need to make sure that

623
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,220
there is time synchronization versus

624
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,080
Company B will have their own and even

625
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,659
if that is let's say a minute or two you

626
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,280
can always compare that okay this is a

627
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,900
start and uh this is the sequence in

628
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
which should happen Okay the seconds

629
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,799
within the organizations will not vary

630
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,179
as much unless it's a connected

631
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,179
organization so that's my perspective

632
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,240
there uh the reporting part is uh as I

633
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,919
said I I completely agree as to why we

634
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,260
need to report uh timelines people may

635
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,020
have their own opinion we are okay and

636
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,880
this is not new reporting requirements

637
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,419
were all established uh when you get to

638
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,860
the

639
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,659
kyc part of it that's where the

640
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,059
complexity starts and I think um Sanjay

641
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,220
gave a classic example of uh when you

642
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,260
try to establish the identity of your

643
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,840
tenant okay now what means are available

644
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
to organizations that's also something

645
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,140
that we have to look at so we understand

646
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,659
the need but how do I go about doing it

647
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,380
how do I if I'm a service provider who's

648
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,960
giving out a VPN service and maybe an

649
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,240
individual is connecting with me what is

650
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,460
the identity that with which I can

651
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,320
validate if I have to go back to the

652
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,720
ground and do it it's impractical in a

653
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
large country like ours

654
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
um if you say aadhar is a verification

655
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,480
mechanism I think the Supreme Court

656
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,159
ruling is very clear that aadhar cannot

657
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,640
be the only way to authenticate so as an

658
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,520
organization if I have to align okay

659
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,620
then what what are the means available

660
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,720
to you it's not that I I do not want to

661
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,419
but can I how practical is it but these

662
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,500
are questions that come on to the

663
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
corporate side that we understand the

664
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,360
objective but the implementation is

665
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,820
where the where as we say the rubber

666
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,380
hits the road is where we really have a

667
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,779
problem too many potholes that creates

668
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:52,919
an issue

669
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,020
so you heard uh so so let me uh

670
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,380
talk about time synchronization first

671
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,380
how many of you have

672
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,000
carried out bcpdr in your organizations

673
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,960
show off hands okay very few

674
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,779
surprising

675
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,480
so if you carried out bcpdr

676
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,779
have you considered a scenario that

677
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,059
you are no longer connected to the rest

678
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,980
of the world the undersea cables have

679
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,440
been cut off

680
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,360
now how do you connect to the rest of

681
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,580
the world

682
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,120
and in that scenario

683
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,459
how are you going to get your time

684
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,179
if you are not connected to NPR or Nic

685
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,220
or whatever we've said

686
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,600
where are you going to get your time

687
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,340
from

688
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,799
have you thought of that scenario

689
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:55,020
consider it put it in your bcpdr plans

690
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,918
no

691
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,900
so

692
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,480
what I'm saying is that you need to

693
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,880
consider various aspects in today's

694
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,400
complex environment

695
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,460
due to the variety of geopolitical stuff

696
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,720
that is happening all around us

697
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,980
so with that

698
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,080
we have been trying to say yes you can

699
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,299
connect outside but when you have a

700
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,400
challenge you should be aware

701
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,740
what you will have or what you will not

702
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,400
also these attacks are

703
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,480
Crossing Borders

704
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,740
now when I have to

705
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,980
get some help support from overseas

706
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,640
search or other agencies whom we are in

707
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,539
touch with

708
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,580
the first thing they ask is give us the

709
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,539
logs

710
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,520
so that we can check and give you back

711
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,679
some data

712
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,880
if the logs are not going to match well

713
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,799
did mention that you can try and

714
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,820
correlate

715
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,880
one or two minutes what we've seen is

716
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,820
that even a few seconds here and there

717
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,620
no one is going to come back they will

718
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,779
say this thing has not emanated from

719
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,900
here

720
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,220
the no one has the time to sit and do

721
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,919
that for you so if the synchronization

722
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,100
of time is not correct there will be a

723
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,200
huge challenge you will never be able to

724
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,400
complete your analysis

725
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,919
[Music]

726
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,980
is the second one was on

727
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,500
the customer said as if I'm audio

728
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,380
service how do you do your kyc for

729
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,520
example let's say there's a company

730
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,440
which offers free VPN services and

731
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,480
hundreds and thousands of people across

732
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,960
so how do you do a kyc

733
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,299
completely agree on the Supreme Court

734
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:46,919
ruling this that aadhaar cannot be the

735
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,080
only one we have not said that should be

736
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,539
the only one

737
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,559
we've said that you can do it in

738
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,140
multiple ways we've given ideas that you

739
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,740
can do it in the fashion what uh the RBI

740
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,080
has suggested or what Savi has suggested

741
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,140
or what dot has suggested you can take

742
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,899
any of those for as long as you have a

743
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,059
mechanism because those will be only

744
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,100
required when there is an incident and

745
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,460
the trail leads up to coming to that

746
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,960
situation

747
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,299
and that time if you say we have no clue

748
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,820
as to who this is what is it

749
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,919
there then you are stuck

750
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,840
so we need that detail only at that time

751
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,700
otherwise we are not requiring those

752
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,440
details at all

753
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,760
so wait for some more time probably

754
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,640
we may come up with a few more

755
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,200
additional

756
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,399
FAQs to address some of these issues

757
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,700
which have been raised so maybe there

758
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,299
will be a few handful of FAQs which will

759
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,860
further come

760
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,200
I can't help but ask is there a time

761
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,440
frame to that new episodes

762
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,179
so I used to be a journalist so I can't

763
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,799
help it

764
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,799
there is a time frame so uh is it within

765
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,670
the six hour

766
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,120
[Laughter]

767
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,919
FAQs are ready it has to go through a

768
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,140
certain process so it's in that process

769
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,659
let me go to that so the moment it comes

770
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,440
back to me it will be up yes yeah so uh

771
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,240
actually from industry perspective I'll

772
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,179
tell you uh I'm not talking only from my

773
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,399
own perspective but what happens is that

774
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,640
every regulator is is

775
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,679
the maturity of every regulator is

776
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,100
different right and for these guidelines

777
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,820
what happens is that uh

778
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,720
even with within bfsi as Ajit was saying

779
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,740
that the way RBI Ida uh and again within

780
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,679
BFS there are enormous Regulators

781
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,980
honestly

782
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,460
PF RDA NSC I mean although NSC BSC are

783
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,640
not Regulators

784
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,260
so we have regulator and costly

785
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,659
regulator and being the financial

786
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,059
industry we have to report to everyone

787
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,520
right and what happens when the the

788
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,080
guideline comes

789
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,700
it is the same guideline which is

790
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,039
getting forwarded but when we ask the

791
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,200
question and this is not my problem but

792
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
when within the industry when we are we

793
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,279
are talking we are here wanted to hear

794
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,200
your point huh we are here to hear only

795
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,360
your point yeah no no it's not only so

796
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm here I'm talking about intent at a

797
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
country level so intent of certain is is

798
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,539
correct and which has to be there right

799
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,899
I mean there is no doubt about it

800
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:36,000
and whatever intent when we try to meet

801
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,399
that intent obviously eventually we will

802
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,440
only get the benefit of it because if

803
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,059
everybody starts reporting the incident

804
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,399
obviously no why only from Bank you know

805
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,440
even other Industries also that is also

806
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,020
going to benefit us only thing is that

807
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,299
all the industries are not matured to

808
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,299
that level to start adopting it right

809
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,340
and that is one of the biggest problem

810
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,980
what and also if you see a seesaw CSO

811
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,899
also ranges rest from 10 years

812
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,700
experience to 30 35 years experience

813
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,980
also so that industry is matured at a

814
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,720
different level csos are matured at

815
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,279
different levels Regulators are matured

816
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,860
at different levels

817
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,320
of that that is the biggest recognition

818
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,000
of that is that they gave additional

819
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,640
time to smes and other companies which

820
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,860
may not have the same maturity so that

821
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,799
end I think 28 September is when so they

822
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,659
extended that time so that recognition

823
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,340
is there to an extent recognition is

824
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,440
there I agree and and there were

825
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,019
discussed so

826
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,539
if Industries are not matured and even

827
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,519
for interpretation of that eventually

828
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,279
any company will say okay let's get the

829
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,620
consulting company and then do it but

830
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,980
that kind of linkage between the central

831
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,200
government to regulator to the industry

832
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,539
I think that one change I think if that

833
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,840
is being done that will help yeah that

834
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,240
will help the systems so I

835
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
I'll just add one more question which I

836
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,039
had for you and Dr behel

837
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,740
that is that intent we all agree was

838
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,500
good and there is a methodology and we

839
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,360
can discuss the methodologies a plus

840
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,960
here and a minus there Etc but also

841
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,418
we've seen that businesses also have

842
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,879
legitimate interests not to reveal too

843
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,260
much of data because this could have

844
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,179
major business implications to your

845
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,460
customers and so on and so forth

846
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,418
so a notification with the right intent

847
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,280
could very easily become a tool for

848
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,000
surveillance as well so where and how do

849
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,918
you ensure that it does not become a

850
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,260
data capturing server installed but

851
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,418
actually serves the original intent

852
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,300
because Dr behel is there today so we

853
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,040
can trust him but tomorrow somebody else

854
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,260
could take over after him and use the

855
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,879
same notifications for different things

856
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,980
so how would you look at that and after

857
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,020
hearing your answer something from Dr

858
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,879
Bell and some additional points that you

859
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,960
wanted to uh sure so when we talk about

860
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,780
um the reporting aspects

861
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,520
yeah

862
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,320
sorry so when we talk about the

863
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,720
reporting aspects and the log collection

864
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,580
and other things I think the rules today

865
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,320
I say that the organization should have

866
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,880
the logs for six months

867
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,859
um across anything that might need

868
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,820
investigations and as required cert may

869
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,980
ask for those logs if they get involved

870
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,020
okay now each of these are independent

871
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,780
statements and depending on the intent

872
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,940
uh maybe as you slightly said maybe the

873
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,800
successor could put a comma somewhere

874
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,020
and the whole thing changes and it can

875
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,960
actually mean that organizations may

876
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,540
have to continuously give data because

877
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,800
it's a demand from the government right

878
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,060
at the end of the day cert is a

879
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,000
government body in that sense so it

880
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,280
could be misused I think it is important

881
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,920
that we set up checks and balances so

882
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,720
that the intent is maintained and also

883
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,160
organizations have a right or to appeal

884
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,720
somewhere in that sense that this is

885
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,579
something that is getting excessive so

886
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,560
today it is logs tomorrow it could get

887
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,480
to data so how do we make sure that

888
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,280
productivity the intent is maintained

889
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,380
second the other point that I just

890
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,720
wanted to put on the table and I think

891
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,460
this is important for us enjoy Also to

892
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,300
reconsider is that the the aspect of

893
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,980
reporting

894
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,500
on organizations perfectly I understand

895
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,119
that intent and that's perfect but when

896
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,560
you talk about a service organization

897
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,839
like ours and you say that whoever

898
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,720
observes it first has the mandate to

899
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,540
report and if you fail in your duties

900
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,460
there is no indemnification technically

901
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,460
it translates to if my organization is

902
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,640
providing services to her company and

903
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,460
I'm running a stock okay I I will only

904
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,619
see incidents so before I tell her I

905
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,500
have to tell sir also right so these are

906
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,320
areas which are catchy because then she

907
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,000
would come back as a customer saying

908
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,800
organization but you have happened to

909
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,540
see it first because that's my that's

910
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,760
the service that's not yours to me I'm

911
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,800
the first person to see it I'm running a

912
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
song okay so before I report here or I

913
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,119
have your parallel reporting for some

914
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,099
maneuvering room so that she gets to

915
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,400
report it rather than the exact thing is

916
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,920
that a fair asks her and if he's

917
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,200
servicing me obviously he will have

918
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,780
obligations to first report to you first

919
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,660
and until unless I say okay do you think

920
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,500
that's a fair point

921
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,660
I will probably disagree because of what

922
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,339
we are seeing on ground

923
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,740
uh

924
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,320
if as a service provider he has reported

925
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,680
to her

926
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,540
cases have been there where it has been

927
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,940
pushed under the carpet

928
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,500
now again the moment you push it under

929
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,720
the carpet no one knows about it the

930
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,940
service provider is aware now when

931
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,880
something else happens and it you do an

932
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,560
audit or you find out some other

933
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,839
incident link it to this and then you

934
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,339
investigate and you find out this is

935
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,780
what had happened why was it not

936
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,420
reported that is where it is all Linked

937
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,140
In

938
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,000
oh we would have reported it's in

939
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,680
reasonable time frame we were about to

940
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,640
report

941
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,680
that's how it gets extended to six

942
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,900
months one year Etc

943
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,119
so we've seen cases and that's why we've

944
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,400
said whoever sees it report now morning

945
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,800
you know uh over breakfast

946
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,920
having some very interesting

947
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,240
conversation about how some of the other

948
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,420
countries uh look at security Etc and

949
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,240
what popped up was Israel

950
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,980
now if you go to Israel from the

951
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,680
physical security space

952
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,660
they are taught that right from

953
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,980
childhood even if a small child

954
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,760
sees someone suspiciously acting on the

955
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,079
road

956
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,760
either they will go and tell that person

957
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,660
why what Etc or they will report

958
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,339
now they don't have to wait for some

959
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,800
CCTV camera to capture it and then that

960
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
should be informed Whoever has seen

961
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,339
something just report

962
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,920
that is how they keep their country safe

963
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,839
now if you are wanting your cyberspace

964
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,780
to be safe and you say that okay it is

965
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,220
their responsibility because there is a

966
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,060
contract

967
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,160
but the contract says yes I'll report to

968
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,240
you and then you shove it under the

969
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,099
carpet that's not acceptable

970
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,160
so that's why I differ there

971
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,579
and the point that they mentioned about

972
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:13,560
reporting a four to six hours in the

973
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,660
banking industry now

974
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,400
if you see everything is interconnected

975
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,500
as I mentioned

976
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,720
if the banking industry can report in

977
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,660
six hours within six hours

978
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,640
it is the other industry which will pull

979
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,320
everyone down

980
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
that's the weakest link then so I

981
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,460
everyone will have to come up to that

982
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,980
level and then start making sure that we

983
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,500
are safe and secure in this digital

984
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,480
world how many of I'll just be one

985
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,440
moment how many of you believe 5G is to

986
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,660
be implemented soon around the corner

987
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,240
and will change everything

988
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,099
so what will change from a threat

989
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,660
perspective do you have any idea

990
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,040
huh

991
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,280
[Music]

992
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,220
more risks and more complex traits

993
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,740
so I was just reading somewhere it is

994
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,880
predicted

995
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,839
that incidence will rise to 5 billion

996
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,160
every 10 minutes

997
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,599
if that is going to happen 5 billion

998
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,000
incidents every 10 minutes

999
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
are you saying that I am going to report

1000
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,820
something after 72 hours and 72 hours is

1001
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,300
for privacy not for security

1002
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,180
so I have exactly two minutes so I'll

1003
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,700
ask two questions and then we'll end

1004
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,040
this session

1005
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,700
but uh the organizers played a trick on

1006
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,920
me at 12 30 they said 15 minutes at 12

1007
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,020
37 they said five minutes so there's

1008
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,020
time synchronization needed right here

1009
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,660
just FYI so first of all it's a welcome

1010
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,880
step from a question I need a sharp

1011
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,980
questions

1012
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,480
it's a welcome step from an Auditor's

1013
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,400
first question question I'm giving I'm

1014
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,839
coming to a question question give me

1015
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,640
one second sir we don't have one second

1016
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,060
okay how do you enforce these six hours

1017
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,040
and all these mandates that you have put

1018
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,900
in Indus in this because I'm clearly

1019
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,940
seeing that most of the Caesars are not

1020
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,400
very comfortable with all of this how do

1021
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,320
you enforce this into an industry see

1022
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,180
the enforcement will start happening the

1023
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,800
moment there are incidents that's why I

1024
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,420
said if you report you have seen

1025
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,640
something a DDOS attack Etc happening

1026
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,880
and you tell us we will enforce it if

1027
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,440
there is an incident the moment we get

1028
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,960
into it and an analysis it'll come

1029
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,880
because there there will be some two

1030
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,040
three four cases which will be put up

1031
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,140
and then everyone will fall in line if

1032
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,640
they are not doing it

1033
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,730
[Music]

1034
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,060
one more thing to clarify to you is that

1035
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,500
it's not that most

1036
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,599
most issues are not comfortable I'm not

1037
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,700
saying that I'm saying that people has

1038
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,040
to understand and start adopting it so

1039
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,020
that was my point yes you had a question

1040
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,520
so just one question when somebody

1041
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,680
reports let's say you know for the

1042
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,900
namesake TCS reports something to you so

1043
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,460
when you propagate that information do

1044
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,079
you capture the essence of the industry

1045
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,480
or you just circulated uh like Anonymous

1046
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,000
no no it's

1047
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,980
first of all the name TCS will never

1048
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,180
come

1049
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,920
we see what is happening from the

1050
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,180
industry perspective we are seeing what

1051
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,980
is happening outside the country also

1052
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,560
and then the advisories are made that's

1053
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,420
why I said advisory making is not an

1054
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,160
easy subject advisory is one part when

1055
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,140
you when we come actually when we put it

1056
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,760
from actionable perspective the

1057
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,619
indicators or compromise the hashes

1058
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,680
domains Etc all those are propagated in

1059
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,320
a automated fashion so if you have the

1060
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,940
capacity to digest it automatically

1061
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,980
through six taxi formats you will be

1062
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,599
able to do it

1063
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,060
okay one last question yeah

1064
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,099
yeah so sir my question to you is that

1065
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,500
uh from a corporate perspective once uh

1066
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,900
the first time I received FAQ it looked

1067
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,660
a bit nebulous a bit ambiguous but the

1068
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,260
subsequent FAQ clarified most of it so

1069
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,540
uh what are so what is your plan firstly

1070
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,859
to scale up as you said that you're

1071
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,319
short of Manpower and secondly uh when

1072
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,420
can we see a future wherein The Advisory

1073
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,280
itself would cater for most of the

1074
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,560
scenarios and we don't lend a land up in

1075
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,480
situation like this one where you have

1076
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,300
to issue multiple FAQs to clarify no

1077
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,760
there is no multiple FAQs I'm just

1078
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,680
saying there was some specific questions

1079
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,760
like

1080
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,740
the raised here also

1081
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,140
which will be addressed so it's not that

1082
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,540
multiple FAQ will keep coming

1083
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,460
because those who are in in this field

1084
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,099
and who understand it technically they

1085
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:33,599
understood what has to be done and they

1086
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,220
are complying to it because we are

1087
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,839
seeing an increase in the number of

1088
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:40,740
reported incidents okay already but

1089
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,599
those who are from the legal perspective

1090
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,040
are still looking at the commas and full

1091
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,540
stops which they can do because that's

1092
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,180
their job and that's how they get paid

1093
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,460
yes yeah I I don't have a question I

1094
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,040
just wanted to uh provide a comment on

1095
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,760
the issue of principal agent which uh

1096
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,300
which was raised so terrorism is a very

1097
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,000
attractive simile to apply in many

1098
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,500
situations see something say something

1099
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,200
but cyber attacks especially the serious

1100
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,180
ones are to be treated like economic

1101
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,460
offenses which go on for long period of

1102
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,619
time and they have to be detected in a

1103
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,319
different manner now in banking for

1104
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,060
example the banking regulator puts the

1105
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,339
responsibility clearly on the principle

1106
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,319
and all outsourced entities have to

1107
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,660
comment through the principle which is a

1108
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,480
bank in this case so I think choosing

1109
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,760
the right metaphor is important and in

1110
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,859
this case I would recommend choosing

1111
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,140
inside a fraud or economic offense as

1112
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,420
the metaphor because that will detect

1113
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,920
the more serious ones otherwise you will

1114
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,200
hear a lot of noise which can enable be

1115
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,359
detected by other means but to detect

1116
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,760
the real serious ones we should take a

1117
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,760
principle as the responsible party and

1118
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,870
the long term approach

1119
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,480
[Music]

1120
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,300
okay yes so my question is six hours of

1121
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,680
recording understood but how do you

1122
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,680
decide what you can't hear what

1123
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,900
can you hear me now yeah so six hours of

1124
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,520
reporting understood how do you decide

1125
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,140
what an incident needs to be reported

1126
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,819
you can't afford every possible I think

1127
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,260
that list has been already provided

1128
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,599
there are some list of 20 incidents so

1129
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,579
have a look at that list it clearly says

1130
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,680
what has to be reported

1131
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,650
q and any final words

1132
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,880
[Music]

1133
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,460
any okay we'll have one more yeah hello

1134
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,740
uh so certain has this uh

1135
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,859
so I have a small question if I have

1136
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,000
this question from like three years I'm

1137
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,500
not sure whom to ask since you are here

1138
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,920
I'm asking the question to you uh so

1139
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,599
it's a very good concept that you are

1140
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,000
empanadling security uh companies and to

1141
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,220
provide to maintain a standard rate so

1142
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,339
the objective is very good uh but when

1143
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,560
it's put into action right

1144
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,839
um I always see that government

1145
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:53,460
especially when it raises tenders right

1146
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,800
for security Audits and stuff they

1147
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,020
always go to the least bidder and in

1148
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,579
some cases I saw that 30 government

1149
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,220
websites are provided uh the least

1150
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,220
bitter Pro quoted for like 30 000 rupees

1151
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,619
for 30 websites of government in such

1152
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,540
cases how do you ensure that the quality

1153
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,180
is being maintained

1154
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,240
this is where the issue of the awareness

1155
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,280
at the user side is lacking okay I think

1156
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,040
with these and whatever is happening in

1157
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,859
the cyberspace we are trying to make

1158
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,500
changes so that they understand that

1159
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,660
this is not the way it will work because

1160
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,819
that's where the incidents start

1161
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,560
the moment these incidents come and

1162
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,000
that's when we start talking to the

1163
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,400
Senior Management and inform them what's

1164
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,020
happening they start understanding what

1165
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,300
mistakes they've gone through yeah

1166
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,579
because most of the senior uh I think uh

1167
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:49,680
I'll add to your point uh so I I think

1168
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,540
long back because we've been for a lot

1169
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,920
of government contracts and we had

1170
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,140
suggested that why don't you remote uh

1171
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,420
split the boq into the functionality and

1172
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,800
the security component so that the

1173
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,240
security is not the area of compromise

1174
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,160
you want to look at it differently

1175
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,839
because different organizations May

1176
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,940
package it the other aspect anything

1177
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,859
going back to the user um the user

1178
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,119
Behavior part you take any government

1179
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,940
tender for that matter the email ID is

1180
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,800
hardly the government ID I have seen so

1181
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,480
many contracts where there it's either a

1182
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,839
Gmail or Yahoo or something I I really

1183
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,240
shocked at times that you can say that

1184
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,520
you Tender Is to be responded to our

1185
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,260
questions are to be put out to a Gmail

1186
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,119
ID surprising

1187
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,700
so a lot of I I do agree with you that

1188
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,740
what we say versus what we do a huge

1189
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,880
difference there's a joke in the

1190
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,619
military that the rifle you're using for

1191
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,619
fighting has been bought from the lowest

1192
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:40,079
uh bidder in that sense so that's

1193
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,819
something that you could possibly look

1194
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,599
at also certain has a responsible

1195
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,040
disclosure responsible vulnerability

1196
