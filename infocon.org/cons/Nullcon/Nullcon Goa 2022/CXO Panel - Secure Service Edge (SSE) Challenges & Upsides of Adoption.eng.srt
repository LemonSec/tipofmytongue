1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,080
thank you

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,319
first of all I would like to thank

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,900
antriksh and his team for building

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,940
nullcon

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,580
to this level because I have been

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,980
associated with nalcon from

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,900
the very first year then when they

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,279
started

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,400
and I have seen it growing uh Leaps and

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,300
Bounds and uh to to my delight uh now

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,019
nalcon has gone overseas and that

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,180
happened during the toughest period uh

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,000
when we were all witnessing close downs

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,579
and lockdowns and whatnot and he was

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,059
doing conferences all over the I mean in

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,820
different continents so thanks to nalcon

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,579
and antariksh and his team

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,920
we are here to discuss about SSE now

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,120
start

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,539
with a slightly lighter note uh

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,140
SSE is Sassy minus an A minus the a now

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,479
you know it's it's very exciting and

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,040
it's very interesting to know that

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,760
whenever a new acronym is

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,520
is delivered in the market or spread in

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
the market by either the gutners or

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,060
Foresters or mckinsey's or any any other

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,119
such organization it actually becomes

29
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,380
very fancy

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,860
and it's it actually becomes not just

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,580
fancy it catches attention of the

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,240
security Community very very fast so uh

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,060
today it is SSC

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,040
uh it's

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
the topic that I'm gonna

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
deal with uh the two-way distinguished

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,060
csos here

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,720
is challenges and upsides of adoption

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,799
now I'm not very sure that you know a

40
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,920
term which was coined like last year has

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,740
already seen a lot of adoption uh

42
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,439
however you know if we if we go a little

43
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,239
bit into the history of sassy that still

44
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,020
has a lot of holds a lot of prominence

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,980
but the the word in the industry is that

46
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,560
you know because it has a lot of

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,120
complexities

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,360
uh a lot of challenges in terms of its

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,720
adoption in totality therefore a

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,680
shortcut was found and you know an

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,340
alphabet was reduced from the acronym so

52
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,080
sassy became became SSE is that the

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,019
right interpretation of uh the whole

54
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,480
scenario with that I'm going to surprise

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,519
both of you with this question so is

56
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,319
that the right interpretation that I am

57
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,239
I'm doing or do you think that SSE is uh

58
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,260
the right way to go for the csos

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,080
uh so uh what I feel I I think your

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,500
interpretation is correct uh because I

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,959
think Whoever has coined this term this

62
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,940
is based on the kind of problems what

63
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,000
industry was facing the kind of uh

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,980
change in the technology transformation

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,800
which is happening uh and because of the

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
change in the transformation and as you

67
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,239
mentioned like okay nalkan has increased

68
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,140
in last two years so even uh the

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,000
technology platforms have changed

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,239
completely the adoption has become uh

71
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
digital is like a by default adoption

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
now

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,659
so any small organization otherwise the

74
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,120
technology was the purview of a bigger

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,819
organization but now uh I mean we are

76
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,620
seeing now so so many startups which are

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,480
coming up right and those startups are

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,640
based on the technology not the startups

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,900
doesn't mean that only the technology

80
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,519
but even the business level startups

81
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,940
also coming in uh so the way the

82
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,920
adoption has become like Cloud adoption

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,620
has become uh So based on that your

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,780
number of problems and the areas of

85
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,420
problem were completely different and as

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,940
you felt like okay because it's it's a

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,680
joke in the whole system right it's a

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
very disruptive Evolution any from

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,299
long-term perspective it is really good

90
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,099
but from short-term perspective I think

91
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,339
are we prepared to that and uh I feel

92
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,899
that you know one is that if you're

93
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,079
starting a new company then you have uh

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
uh you have a liberty or rather the the

95
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,620
scope for putting down these systems

96
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
from the day one but if you have a

97
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,000
legacy and changing the Legacy for

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,639
example in our in our system by the way

99
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,740
uh this says whatever I'm saying it has

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,600
nothing to do with yes bank so that's

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,820
the first disclaimer second disclaimer

102
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,320
which I was telling Rahul before

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,960
starting uh so whatever we are saying

104
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,460
that okay that is my personal opinion

105
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,440
and has nothing to do with a product or

106
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
implementation or anything so please

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
take that as my technology level uh

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,699
knowledge sharing uh so the kind of

109
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,560
problems for we saw the longer run

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
perspective Rahul I think this will this

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,540
is going to happen uh only time is only

112
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,180
the solution uh and I as I was saying

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,180
that changing the Legacy really takes a

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,880
lot of time right I mean we have seen by

115
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,280
2K we have seen so many changes we have

116
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,100
seen e-commerce industry evolving it uh

117
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,440
maybe five years down the line sassy is

118
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,540
going to be by default and SSC will be

119
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,639
like you know you're working on partial

120
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,460
part uh again it depends on the kind of

121
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,380
company and the kind of Readiness what

122
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,740
you have for adopting the sasi but if

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,840
you see where you we have a huge

124
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,419
footprint and the impact is going to be

125
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,660
uh huge in that case it is better to

126
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,900
take SSE as the first step but

127
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
eventually for uh and in my view that

128
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,080
for every company we need to have that

129
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,759
in our planner somewhere that you know

130
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,820
because access is although I mean in our

131
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,139
all policies whoever is from the

132
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,880
corporate side will say need to know

133
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,180
base is access now that because of so

134
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,340
much of Outsourcing so much of fintech

135
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,460
so much of a business level types which

136
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,400
are happening need to know itself is

137
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,220
vague right I mean so what do you mean

138
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,020
by need to know today what I need to

139
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,900
know tomorrow it's obsolete right and

140
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,240
therefore we will have to come with a

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,000
with a kind of uh context based access

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,759
management also and so we need to have

143
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
that in our roadmap and we need to

144
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,860
really uh mature our systems and the

145
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,139
architecture in a way that we add that a

146
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,319
as a part of SSE so and that's yeah I

147
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,360
think I think a great start to the

148
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,000
conversation and I'm sorry I disrupted

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,120
the whole uh you know flow of

150
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
conversation the way I planned it and

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,639
the way I'm doing it however I think

152
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,220
there is a merit uh in coming straight

153
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,740
onto the topic rather than uh you know

154
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,199
starting with some Theory and then and

155
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,419
then coming to the practicals um

156
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,440
so if we uh Rajesh if we talk about the

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,960
composition of sassy and the composition

158
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,199
of SSE there's just one element which is

159
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,000
missing between the two

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,280
now you know when we talk about the

161
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,620
composition of sassy it's it starts with

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,020
the networking part which is the sd-wan

163
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,120
then cast B then firewall as a service

164
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,759
then zero plus network access

165
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,960
centralized management and what not

166
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,800
right and when we talk about the SSC and

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
that's my understanding I'll also

168
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,060
request each one of you to contribute to

169
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,680
this conversation if I am missing

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,139
something so the composition of SSE is

171
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,919
firewall as a service caspi ztna

172
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,940
secure web Gateway now you know between

173
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,620
these two

174
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,840
what was difficult in sassy that we had

175
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,660
to uh you know tone it down and bring it

176
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,099
to SSE

177
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,620
so yeah

178
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,020
hello hello

179
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,240
so I think yeah so it's a very very good

180
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,000
question which you asked and uh a lot of

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,940
vendors and a lot of people actually

182
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,759
confused between the sassy and the SSC I

183
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,380
think we let's have to take the two step

184
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,360
back and try understanding the

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,340
difference so the difference is as you

186
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,479
rightly said

187
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,120
it's only the SD van which is different

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,520
in SSE versus the versus The Sassy so um

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,599
if you see in 2000 uh just before the uh

190
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,160
just before all this pandemic and all

191
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,900
that so everybody was talking about

192
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,020
sassy because that's uh

193
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,760
paradigm shift for anybody because uh

194
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,458
people wanted their workloads and all

195
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,080
that which were there in the cloud and

196
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
they wanted to access their applications

197
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,799
which are sitting in the data centers

198
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,279
and all that but pandemic actually

199
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,660
changed quite a lot and a lot of those

200
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,519
applications which were in data center

201
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,339
were actually moved to the cloud so then

202
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,920
and then most of the people had

203
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,200
the sort of sd-wan and the network

204
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,420
connectivity and all that for the data

205
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,519
centers and all that but

206
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,300
now immediate us there was like how do I

207
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,920
ensure my now workloads have moved to

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,100
the cloud how do I ensure my cloud is is

209
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,560
saved there so now what most of the

210
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,480
people are doing it is they are taking a

211
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,940
step sort of approach first is Implement

212
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,920
uh SSE which is basically a minus sd-wan

213
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,660
and then you know maybe in the Second

214
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,720
Step go towards the uh so a sassy is

215
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
definitely a strategic solution

216
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,279
because that will anyway will ensure all

217
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,320
your applications which are in your data

218
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,839
center and which requires the access to

219
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,300
the data center would also be accessible

220
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,459
but I think uh it's a stop Gap

221
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,200
Arrangement and maybe in couple of years

222
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,779
time you will see sassy will eventually

223
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,320
will become a sort of a solution because

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,820
a sort of a company like us which are

225
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,100
banks where my crown jewels and all that

226
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,080
are there I still do not wanted to put

227
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,000
that in the cloud so I do still wanted

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,459
to have that sort of a connectivity uh

229
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,100
through my sd-wan and from my network

230
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,080
connectivity point of view and I do

231
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,240
still have some of my workloads like

232
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,700
some of the office applications or

233
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,920
collaboration applications which are on

234
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,560
the cloud so I still wanted to have

235
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,620
secure that so that my data which is uh

236
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,140
transitioning over the multiple csps

237
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,560
doesn't actually now you know

238
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,940
confidentiality of the data doesn't go

239
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,399
out so that's why I think it's a maybe a

240
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,620
one step before the actual

241
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,899
implementation of SSE also

242
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,420
um you know to to my understanding and

243
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,100
whatever I have

244
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,100
read or understood about the comparison

245
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,140
I mean the differences between the two

246
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,600
now uh that's a question that I want to

247
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,579
ask both of you one by one starting with

248
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,440
I mean what is more important is it uh

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,160
both security and the upgradation of

250
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,980
network infrastructure which suits or

251
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,640
which can tackle the changing needs of

252
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,959
an organization

253
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,019
or you think that Network can wait for

254
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,120
now because we are facing a lot of

255
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,980
turbulence in the cyber security space

256
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,260
and therefore that needs to be tackled

257
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,480
first a network can come later and

258
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,620
therefore

259
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,579
SSE is the immediate solution sassy can

260
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,420
wait is that the case

261
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,100
so uh it's a very subjective question

262
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Rahul uh because uh

263
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
uh again you know as you mentioned like

264
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
can Network

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,060
um let's say upgrade can wait because

266
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,700
there is a security issue

267
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,120
uh so for organization like if you go

268
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,339
only Technology Way like we say okay

269
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,040
this is First Step Second Step third

270
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,579
step and all but security is so dynamic

271
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,200
because your thread landscape is so

272
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,360
dynamic

273
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,700
we had not emphasized the adoption of

274
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,100
cloud in last two I mean before two

275
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,779
years before pandemic right and I've

276
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,760
seen in the in the group in the ciso

277
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,279
group when we discussed uh or maybe with

278
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,140
couple of cios when they spoke to me

279
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,620
that this is what I have it what have

280
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,440
you adopted or what how are you managing

281
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,500
uh your work from home and all and they

282
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,560
were not prepared for the VPN and BDI

283
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,019
access and all and regulator says that

284
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,940
you know however you know whatever the

285
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,579
situation is we can give you a bit of a

286
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,160
time uh time duration but obviously you

287
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,839
need to ensure that customer data is

288
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,959
safe right uh in that case there are a

289
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,260
lot of solutions like uh you know uh VPN

290
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,420
on Cloud vdi on cloud

291
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,700
these kind of solutions were like okay

292
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,959
quick

293
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,620
we don't take off right zero Runway uh

294
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,920
the distance and then you just take off

295
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,440
companies have really gained the

296
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,480
attention that and as Rajesh was saying

297
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,579
sassy was one of them might have been

298
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,540
the solution might have been already

299
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,880
five years back but this is this was

300
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,620
opportunity for everybody so which is

301
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,800
good uh coming back to your question on

302
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,860
do we take a decision on whether we

303
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,899
upgrade the network or we take the sassy

304
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,480
so honestly I went from organization

305
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,240
perspective it becomes like you way okay

306
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,300
it's like you need to calibrate and you

307
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,459
need to find out what exactly the

308
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,220
priority is but we can't say that you

309
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,779
know yes this is important this is

310
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,540
important and we should not put SSC or

311
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,880
sassy implementation in our roadmap

312
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,579
because if we are not prepared for today

313
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,220
obviously this is a disaster we are just

314
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,320
waiting for the time and you know if we

315
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,040
don't adopt uh the way we are having uh

316
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,920
connected or right rather you know the

317
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,380
business types so a lot of business have

318
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,440
evolved where uh one startup comes with

319
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,540
one idea but but regulatory point of

320
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,040
view they can't do it so they take the

321
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,560
platform of banking for having a tie up

322
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
and providing the like has somebody

323
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,540
thought about swiggy providing grocery

324
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,639
right has somebody thought about denzo

325
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,040
which is a delivery right we always know

326
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,240
uh The Courier system is like only uh

327
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,660
you know maybe uh your uh any FedEx and

328
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,639
all those things right so these kind of

329
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,240
solutions are wallet right UPI we never

330
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,920
thought about it in last two years up

331
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,980
adoption is like huge right I mean from

332
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,579
that perspective uh if you say which one

333
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,760
to Chile choose we can't choose only one

334
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
obviously we will have to choose with

335
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,100
the priority but we will have to have uh

336
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,600
these kind of solution as a part of

337
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
strategic road maps I asked I asked a

338
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,740
very contradictory I mean I asked a very

339
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,839
controversial question to you I can't

340
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,360
expect you to take sides but uh yeah and

341
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,540
I and I I very well dodged that actually

342
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,560
otherwise I would have been out so I'm

343
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,180
going to rephrase that question for uh

344
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,560
for Rajesh uh you know uh

345
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,139
precisely what we are talking about that

346
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,260
uh security capabilities are prioritized

347
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,779
over the network network capabilities of

348
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,019
an organization and and therefore

349
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:09,480
um SSC is going to uh be be the first

350
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,420
choice then the sassy am I right or am I

351
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,600
wrong yeah you're right and uh as I said

352
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,820
so most of the organizations already

353
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,980
have some or other sort of a network

354
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,199
whether it's through the SD van or

355
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,060
through the VPN and all that they have

356
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,980
those type of connectivities in any way

357
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,240
so

358
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,000
um that definitely now for I think the

359
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
most of the organizations the immediate

360
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
priorities to uh the workloads which are

361
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,940
there on the cloud at least how do I

362
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,060
secure those workloads so I think that

363
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,620
would definitely will be a priority at

364
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,899
least for next couple of years uh till

365
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,440
uh everybody moves into it and we uh we

366
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,300
move all our applications also onto the

367
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,260
cloud

368
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,320
great so just to add like uh you know

369
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
one is that what we think about it from

370
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
the roadmap perspective uh if there's a

371
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,220
technology form and there's no regulated

372
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,940
entity then you have a good you know uh

373
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,240
free cricket ground to play huh but when

374
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,100
there is a regulated entity obviously

375
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,740
regulator is there so we have umpire and

376
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,420
we have third Empire and everything we

377
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,399
have it so we have to even balance that

378
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
also but I feel that even from Cesar's

379
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
perspective this uh thought should be

380
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
for preparing it shouldn't be only a

381
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,779
technology initiative it should also be

382
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,699
a security initiative because whatever

383
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,000
the eventually it is addressing the

384
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
security concerns and not only your

385
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,720
technology infrastructure concerns so

386
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,420
just uh I mean in my view I think that

387
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,620
also should be a part of security

388
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,440
roadmap then earlier technology roadmap

389
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,779
no that's that's very logical and very

390
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,000
true okay so we

391
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,940
do good on time uh I do not generally

392
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,160
moderate final discussions which are

393
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,639
very one-way communication so I provoke

394
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,120
uh people sitting in the audience and

395
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,519
the delegates who are here to ask

396
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,240
questions or make uh a statement or or

397
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,280
give their viewpoint

398
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,439
there is a hand out there so please can

399
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,780
we have the mic

400
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,380
please don't ask technical questions

401
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,459
you can't expect a business question

402
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,459
from him I'm sure by looking at this

403
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,699
that say I just put a disclaimer hello

404
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,059
hi good afternoon panelists so um my

405
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,500
question is basically

406
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,020
um you I heard you talking about the UPI

407
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,380
uh you mentioned a point regarding UPI

408
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,380
um my question is that uh I feel there

409
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,500
is a flaw when it comes to UPI so the

410
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,660
thing is that for example we have a

411
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,960
number linked to our bank account

412
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,120
and uh for uh like I have a number which

413
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
is linked to my bank account and I

414
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,020
discontinue that number so now the thing

415
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,179
is that uh somebody else who's got that

416
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,520
number and has linked that to his

417
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,900
account

418
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,179
um the thing is that I will still be

419
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,280
receiving money on that so that is

420
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,380
something which is uh like which comes

421
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,760
out to be a flaw in the system

422
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,600
the UPI has a built-in capability called

423
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,539
device binding so your device basically

424
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,840
also get binded with the with your ID as

425
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,320
well also whatever your vpa is so uh at

426
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,840
least we have not seen people misusing

427
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,840
that so if you have some uh workaround

428
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,820
and we can show us and that would be a

429
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,460
good in any way but usually there are

430
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,440
there are a lot of other parameters it

431
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,720
gets checked before your actual UPI

432
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,340
transaction goes through

433
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,400
even if I face that in real life so I

434
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,220
was making a transaction and uh this

435
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,919
issue occurred and like I was very

436
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,780
curious to know about it and it depends

437
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,059
also you know the implementation of

438
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,400
although most of the UPI applications

439
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,860
are pretty much similar whether you take

440
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,700
yes bank or any other bank

441
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,100
UPI application but having said this

442
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,559
each of them has a different flavors and

443
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,000
all that and how they actually

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,700
communicate at the back end the npci is

445
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,380
the one which has created a railroad

446
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,080
right so the we all all our all our

447
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,059
banks basically use that same railroad

448
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,640
to connect to any transaction when you

449
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,740
do UPI transaction it goes through the

450
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,260
npci and then comes back and then actual

451
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,179
debit happens from your account in any

452
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,299
way so it could be a maybe a particular

453
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,240
A Bank application also flow we have to

454
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,700
look at it thank you so I think this is

455
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,980
the evolution and I don't know when did

456
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,559
you check that and as Rajesh said that

457
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,260
you know so again you know if you see

458
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,419
security security every time there will

459
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,039
be some bug which will be identified

460
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,539
right I don't know when did you test

461
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,240
that but as Rajesh said npci if I

462
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,039
remember correct I think two two and a

463
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,720
half year back or three years back they

464
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,120
had put down and that was also evolution

465
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,940
of the technology uh so they had put

466
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,380
down all these things as the same

467
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,539
binding and as he said like okay if

468
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,600
you're using a UPI application of any

469
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
particular bank or any particular third

470
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,380
party I think that application may have

471
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,140
a problem I have tried it because I was

472
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,480
giving access of my up handle to my son

473
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
and he couldn't do that so I I I'm sure

474
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,520
it might be uh this thing but uh yeah I

475
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,620
think you should speak to the bank or

476
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,840
whichever app you are using it you need

477
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,880
to inform those guys because as a

478
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,620
overall ecosystem somewhere if there's

479
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,780
some bug which is identified then we

480
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,240
need to really uh tune that and another

481
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,919
possibility could be that if somebody

482
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,200
has put on some kind of business process

483
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,000
from customer convenience perspective

484
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,220
I'm not sure because what app what

485
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,960
you're using based on that it will be

486
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,419
but uh if there is any business process

487
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,400
as a customer convenience let's say if

488
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,020
you're allowed to log in and then do

489
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,940
something that might be a flaw process

490
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,980
level flow thank you

491
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,059
okay

492
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,799
um any other

493
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,530
yes please

494
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,740
[Music]

495
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,039
hi uh good afternoon

496
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,559
it's directly focused towards because we

497
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,020
have banking sector people over here so

498
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,020
uh security person is a very primer

499
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,720
facing very big important perspective in

500
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,059
infrastructure like yours

501
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,340
uh earlier people used to trust captive

502
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,140
networks more you have your own

503
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,179
on-premise network and you rely to your

504
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,120
own servers but like what you brought

505
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,220
out is that when two years back people

506
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,919
thought about working from home or

507
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,200
having security as a service

508
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,720
so how this perspective really changed

509
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,280
in the environment in which you are

510
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,020
working for how the mentality actually

511
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,600
changed and how that will be if you can

512
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
just share your experience for enabling

513
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,880
people or your uh your entire company to

514
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,640
switch and to even think about or

515
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,679
enabling people to give a perspective to

516
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,720
work from home rather than actually

517
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
coming to office and then

518
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,880
bringing on the list so I'll actually

519
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,520
share my personal experience and I feel

520
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,039
that maybe I'm also fortunate enough to

521
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,480
see this wave and see how uh

522
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,240
I mean if if you sit in our seesaw chair

523
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,900
honestly it becomes too difficult to say

524
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,539
every time you can't say either yes or

525
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,280
no right you have to find the balance of

526
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,860
it and when this happened and we know

527
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,980
that it was a jerk in the system like on

528
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,559
22nd it was

529
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,059
announced that from in two three days

530
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,340
25th the whole country level lockdown

531
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,280
started right and it's not only the work

532
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,740
from home right if you if you think from

533
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,620
the bank perspective it is one is the

534
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,440
access but if you see this whole problem

535
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
is a BCP problem business continuity

536
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,059
problem right having access is one part

537
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,120
of it okay in our discipline plan we

538
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,980
never we had epidemic and we never had

539
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,240
pandemic

540
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
from one branch if that branch is down

541
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,919
then you go to the next Branch plus the

542
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,320
RBI had regulation or rather mandate

543
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,440
saying that you need to be attentive and

544
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,240
attend all the customers in all the

545
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,460
branches right so our Branch Banking has

546
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,860
to work at the same time because the

547
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,299
travel and all those restrictions are

548
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,159
there so we have to provide Excel and in

549
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,320
our Theory and security Theory we say

550
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
sensitive data we will not give access

551
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,340
to remote and when these requests

552
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,380
started coming in you know my team was

553
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,840
handling we can't give because this is

554
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,220
what our rule is right we don't give

555
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,340
access to to car data outside or any

556
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,799
sensitive data outside and that is where

557
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,240
it was a very

558
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,820
um we were on the edge double double

559
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,120
sword uh double a sword saying that if

560
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,980
we give access this is a problem if we

561
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,419
don't give access also there is a

562
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,220
problem and regulation says you need to

563
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,679
ensure the customer data is protected by

564
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,120
giving remote access how can you protect

565
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,340
customer data but it was also the

566
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,620
downside of it because so many phishing

567
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,940
attacks started

568
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,700
customers if they call center is not

569
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,679
reachable branches they can't travel

570
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,200
because of lockdown

571
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,539
how will you service the customer until

572
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,380
unless you give the access or VPN vdi

573
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,020
whatever we will have to do that and the

574
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,760
problem is not only up to that honestly

575
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,179
it was a huge problem because we

576
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,059
provided vdi VPN access but the person

577
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,799
who is working from home does he has

578
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,520
laptop desktop he may not have it and we

579
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,860
don't have so many laptops right the

580
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,120
whole Market was flooded with

581
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,580
requirement of laptop so if you see

582
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,860
operationally technical challenges not

583
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,419
only a security challenges it is a

584
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,799
technology challenge it is a business

585
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,080
level Channel

586
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,000
overall be provided unfortunately maybe

587
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,520
we'll we were prepared for the vdi

588
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,679
access and all of the things and for

589
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
short time we had to take a call saying

590
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,500
that give it and list start fine tuning

591
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,440
the accesses and the controls in the

592
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,780
backhand side so so maybe two to three

593
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,600
months it might take us a lot of time

594
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,880
again problem doesn't stop there because

595
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,380
there are so many attacks which were

596
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,260
happening on I think on VPN the VPN was

597
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,260
exploited right so I I think it is a

598
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,900
good time for learning yeah but finally

599
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,580
successfully we manage it yeah

600
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,740
it's uh although it's a BCP problem but

601
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,100
at the same time even the BCP also you

602
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,960
know none of the nobody in the world has

603
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,059
actually checked 100 business continuity

604
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,620
am right so most of the business

605
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,260
continuity plans are built on 50 75

606
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,460
percent

607
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,860
um nobody build a business continuity

608
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,320
for 100 so this was like uh in banking

609
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,020
we call it a Black Swan event busy so

610
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,419
everything shut down globally suddenly

611
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,059
and then everybody has to you know work

612
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,880
remotely so and everybody has a

613
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,620
different way of I think some of the

614
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,500
banks where the traditional

615
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,000
brick and motor type of banks are there

616
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,220
so they have some different type of ways

617
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,559
they worked it for us it was bit easier

618
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,720
because ours is completely digital bank

619
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,940
so we are branchless bank and all that

620
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,900
so

621
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,480
for us providing that sort of a we

622
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
already have most of the people had the

623
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,080
um you know laptops and all that they

624
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,000
can connect it from only thing is that

625
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,100
wherever uh like certain operations in

626
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,559
the bank can't be operated from branches

627
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,059
and all that or can't be operated from

628
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,940
home but uh I just actually wanted to

629
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,460
appreciate the regulator also here

630
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,140
because they actually allowed because

631
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,779
some of the some of the operations in

632
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,600
the bank can't be run from the home so

633
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
but they allowed during that period and

634
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,000
uh we we basically uh then allowed

635
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,400
people to work from home that way so I

636
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,980
think it's a everybody has their own

637
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,740
challenges but it was like a sort of a

638
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,600
Black Swan movement for most of the

639
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,240
banks and most of the most of most of

640
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,380
the world okay

641
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,779
okay so one last question before I start

642
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,419
my conversation again with the panel

643
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,460
yeah hi um just would love to understand

644
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,340
from your perspective like where are you

645
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,140
guys in the Journey of sassy right now

646
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,659
you know both represent at least yeah

647
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,279
that's that's the question I wanted to

648
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,419
ask but

649
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,059
it's okay somebody has to ask this

650
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,500
question

651
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,539
journey of

652
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,020
sassy okay okay

653
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,179
I hope you're not a somebody who's

654
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,799
selling this as he's a legitimate right

655
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,740
so

656
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,320
so yeah so I think uh as I said it's uh

657
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,820
as you rightly mentioned it's a journey

658
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,260
am right so

659
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,260
um most of us are I think evaluating at

660
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,940
least in the banks and all that uh

661
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,340
considering that some now a lot of our

662
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,020
workloads and all that are moved to the

663
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,260
cloud so we all are evaluating some way

664
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,400
or other way

665
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,000
um at least SSC Solutions uh but as uh

666
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,400
it's a journey so we will maybe go to

667
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
The Sassy in a couple of years time but

668
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,179
at this moment uh I think we are

669
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:52,860
evaluating some of the SSC Solutions so

670
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,539
you have you have asked a very relevant

671
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,640
question I will rephrase this question

672
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,100
in many other ways to these two uh

673
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,020
distributions I was passing to dodge the

674
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,059
question but he's going to catch me uh

675
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,880
okay so you have a point yeah I have one

676
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,620
can you hear me okay

677
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,279
so sassy is a great concept and solid

678
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,400
right but it talks about Technologies

679
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,460
combinations of a lot of Technologies uh

680
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,140
like some key components that are left

681
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,120
out that we talk don't talk about the

682
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,100
people in processes behind it

683
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,240
so

684
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,980
I've been in companies where the

685
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,200
networking security team that they own

686
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,820
their products and they don't let

687
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,580
anybody else touch them

688
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,799
combining all these Technologies into a

689
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,740
single platform single console do you

690
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,720
feel there's some challenges ahead that

691
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,980
we need to

692
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,200
overcome what the people in process is

693
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,220
to align those groups in order for sassy

694
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,419
to be really successful or SSE

695
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,100
I we didn't get the last but so do you

696
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,400
think what is sorry do you think so I I

697
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,179
think culturally a lot of companies

698
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,279
some teams have the Technologies

699
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,500
security has firewall

700
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,980
networking has sd-wan you have an IAM

701
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,380
team that manages zero trust

702
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,360
yeah all these teams have to come

703
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,179
together and work in unity in order for

704
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,640
us to see and SAS C to become fully

705
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,799
successful the concept to fully work its

706
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,620
way out do you feel these challenges are

707
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,399
going to be a hard one to overcome or do

708
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,440
you think we can all come together and

709
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,659
and make it happen

710
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,419
so I think

711
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:35,100
if I understood a question correctly so

712
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,380
use now you're saying that is it more of

713
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,559
a cultural change for a organization am

714
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,260
I right is that the so let me let me we

715
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,580
rephrase him as question

716
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,919
for both the Legacy organizations and

717
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,720
the new organizations The fact will

718
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,940
remain that you know there were strong

719
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,399
vendors who were providing sd-wan

720
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,620
solutions they were very strong vendors

721
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,580
who are providing zero trust Solutions

722
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,200
and other Security Solutions that are

723
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,539
part of SSC now are you are you geared

724
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,880
up to take that approach as a

725
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,820
Consolidated uh you know one vendor

726
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,260
Consolidated uh unified solution

727
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,539
is that the case no so I think it's uh

728
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,460
is that the question you had no yeah

729
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,500
that's that's yeah sure so I think yeah

730
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,440
now so now I go back to the principle of

731
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,080
you know defense in depth which uh which

732
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,000
is very relevant in even in this

733
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,880
scenario so I would personally believe I

734
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,279
think uh and most of the organizations

735
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,880
would prefer to take maybe SSC and then

736
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,220
go into assessment later on assessee but

737
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,440
they have to have a separate vendors uh

738
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,419
to do that activity instead of just

739
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,940
having a one single uh vendor providing

740
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,760
it because uh at the end of the day if

741
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,440
it is if it is one particular

742
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,360
vulnerability which is compromise in

743
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,120
particular one sassy provider you may

744
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,520
have uh the whole uh you know Network or

745
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,679
even the all your workloads can be a

746
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,440
compromise so uh I would at least prefer

747
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,559
to have a separate vendor approach

748
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,659
versus the okay let me ask you a

749
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,000
question I mean he gave an answer which

750
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,659
was uh right from his perspective but do

751
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:19,620
you think that

752
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,740
any particular technology or a security

753
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,500
vendor has the capabilities of putting

754
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,120
all of these elements together and offer

755
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,919
as one unified solution

756
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,840
well you can't ask me that because I

757
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,020
work in that scope so I obviously you

758
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,100
know my answer

759
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,919
um but you know I honestly we we we

760
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,919
support netscope internally from a uh

761
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,679
zero or customer zero so we we like to

762
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,360
test it out internally in our corporate

763
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,580
environment before hopefully it rolls

764
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,799
out to the production all right now

765
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,799
production other customers uh so we have

766
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,320
Facebook challenges internally of you

767
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,480
know a networking team please work with

768
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,200
us in unity to you know put put away

769
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,340
your existing VPN solution and adopt you

770
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,799
know our zero trust solution

771
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,700
um

772
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,799
so we've run into challenges internally

773
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,760
I know companies that would fall into

774
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,679
similar category and to answer your

775
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,600
question the kitten's separate you know

776
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,159
that that kind of goes against some of

777
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,760
the Gartner you know definitions around

778
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,440
SSC it's it's supposed to be a combined

779
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,159
solution with a combined dashboard you

780
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,419
know um

781
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,419
centrally managed uh type of thing so it

782
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,880
that that's the question I was asking in

783
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,760
alignment with Gartner's definition you

784
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,039
know do you think that's achievable

785
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,580
you know see you're having a problem of

786
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,500
implementing a single solution for

787
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,820
everything is

788
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,640
uh it's like uh Jack of everything right

789
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,279
and there'll be hardly any solution who

790
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,980
will Who really has the death and each

791
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,740
domain right if you if we talk about say

792
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,240
there are four or five products what we

793
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,340
are talking about it so actually for

794
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,919
product companies and for example let's

795
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,779
say endpoint security if

796
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,600
take advantage security or caspi not

797
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,100
necessarily that the same solution will

798
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,399
provide in the exhaustive solution

799
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,500
rather if the block companies the way we

800
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
talk about collaboration so this is what

801
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,980
in every panel or rather conference

802
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,120
collaboration is one of the product I

803
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,799
think between the product companies also

804
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,419
there need to be a collaboration and you

805
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,460
need to see how the different solution

806
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,980
can interoperate with each other and

807
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,019
then only I think we will have a very

808
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,059
good cohesive system where we talk about

809
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,000
having uh the best of bit product but

810
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,340
they work very well with each other so I

811
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,500
think that is that is again an evolution

812
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,960
I think I'm sure in technology

813
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,960
evaluation like earlier 10 15 years back

814
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,419
we were having P2P API integration and

815
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,580
now nobody is talking about P2P API

816
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,980
integration we are talking about ESPN I

817
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,779
remember 20 years back ESB was a very

818
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,059
very New Concept right so maybe for our

819
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,679
cyber security product also I think that

820
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,200
maturity will come uh yeah it's a matter

821
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,679
of time but being a c so we feel uh we

822
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,560
need uh the best Solutions and in-depth

823
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,560
solution of that area and uh overall yes

824
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,679
consolidation helps from our own

825
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,839
perspective because we have end-to-end

826
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,480
visibility about that uh but today I

827
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,679
don't think you know there is even

828
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,300
Product Company who is really matured

829
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,859
enough to give end-to-end solution for

830
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,040
everything

831
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,178
[Music]

832
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,780
umizen see so power of Finance

833
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,159
Corporation

834
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,500
and when we talk about the integrated

835
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,719
approach and the overall coverage of the

836
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,659
security part so we as we know that RBI

837
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,060
has put up a security framework for

838
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,940
banks and nbfcs to have the complete

839
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,679
coverage so I just wanted to have a

840
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,480
highlight of your organizations from

841
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,720
paytm and yes banks that have you uh

842
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,339
framed up any framework for your

843
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,080
organization as per right by guidelines

844
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,080
which covers all the aspects the assays

845
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,700
expecting other differences difference

846
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,920
in depth approaches aspects so that

847
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,140
there is you know end to end thought

848
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,240
process gone into the future roadmap of

849
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,220
security in your organization

850
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,040
honestly we don't have a choice so we

851
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,320
have to do that in front of regulators

852
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,020
you are hands-folded and and once there

853
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,820
is a regulation I see being a c so we

854
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,380
also take this opportunity because when

855
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,780
there is a guideline we also have a

856
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,940
basis to drive that internally so we

857
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,460
also take that basis now when you define

858
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,800
this whole roadmap and again what we

859
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,839
Define roadmap three years back and what

860
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,000
roadmap during pandemic we had to change

861
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,280
so every year we also have to look back

862
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,320
because the whole threat landscape is

863
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,940
changing every time the kind of trend

864
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,339
which is changing every time so we have

865
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,500
to keep on changing that but

866
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,460
I I don't think security is like uh uh

867
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,200
like once you do it and forget about it

868
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,240
right it's a journey and we have to keep

869
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,820
on visiting to that roadmap and see what

870
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,820
do we change it what do we de-prioritize

871
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,920
what do we prioritize it and we need to

872
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,800
have cost benefit analysis and uh based

873
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,619
on that I think obviously uh yeah we

874
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,119
have to be dynamic we have to be agile

875
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,220
yeah right yes of course now

876
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,040
security framework in 2016 and then they

877
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,540
also keep updating now they have

878
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,060
released last year about six months back

879
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,160
digital payment security framework

880
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,099
because they saw the whole growth of UPI

881
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,839
and the whole digital payment so they

882
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,880
released that which is again very very

883
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,079
nah you know futuristic sort of uh

884
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,339
Direction Master Direction which they've

885
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,540
released it

886
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,599
um so I think they also keep it's as uh

887
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,820
most of you know speakers although we're

888
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,680
saying here so it's evolving the area

889
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,260
and if now when they see something new

890
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,480
happening they also I don't think so

891
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,160
they have come up specifically with any

892
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,619
specific technology like sassy or SSE

893
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,140
but they will have that framework which

894
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,480
will basically Define the cloud related

895
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,460
controls versus your data center related

896
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,540
controls

897
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,240
that's that's an important Point okay

898
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,859
people don't like me the moderator

899
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,180
therefore there are people who are

900
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,880
asking questions so I am happy uh to

901
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,220
give it give it away maybe we can say

902
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,440
that they're liking our answers that's

903
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,920
true that's true that's definitely true

904
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,740
uh so hi my name is prathmesh uh I'm

905
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,380
from nine Consulting I work as a senior

906
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,660
security engineer there so my question

907
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,960
is to all of you guys uh adding to the

908
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,619
search uh futuristic keyword so how how

909
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:43,560
much integration or per se penetration

910
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,680
of AI is being going around within your

911
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,040
organization have you already added a uh

912
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,940
added uh some analytics or like how how

913
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,420
strong do you believe uh your uh AI

914
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,160
capabilities are according to

915
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,200
individuals organizations so can you can

916
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,380
you be a little specific AI in in what

917
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
sense I mean uh to perform what function

918
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,820
your product or Services which you guys

919
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,300
provide okay in that uh okay have you

920
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,220
have you already integrated all of this

921
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,500
or is it something you are as a

922
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,260
futuristic uh scenario you are working

923
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,119
on that so that's less of a security

924
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,180
question than uh of a product yeah so

925
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,920
yeah so now I'll maybe now um

926
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,960
we may be able to give you a perspective

927
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,940
from A bank's point of view because

928
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,940
banking usually adopt technology whether

929
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,099
it's AI or ML and all that pretty

930
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,380
quickly versus the any other industry so

931
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,300
we will just stick to our

932
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,500
um you know industry and we will just

933
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,599
tell you about that industry

934
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,900
um so AI in the banks uses multiple ways

935
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,880
they will use it right even our fraud

936
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,820
recognition and all that when uh so

937
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,380
every transaction happens digitally am I

938
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,000
right so within that fraction of second

939
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,900
we have to take a call so and then

940
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,040
millions of transactions happens every

941
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,599
minute and every seconds and algorithm

942
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,359
right so that AI as part of that is

943
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,339
already built into it it looks into your

944
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,260
profile it sees where exactly are coming

945
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,740
in from and all that is Rule engines and

946
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,839
the learning engines are built into the

947
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,540
into a lot of our fraud Solutions

948
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,300
similarly if you go to the Security

949
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,400
Solutions then all our

950
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,420
your sim Solutions and all that because

951
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,040
millions of logs comes in MRI so there

952
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,660
again has to be some sort of a decision

953
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,359
has to be taken based on the some of the

954
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,220
learnings and all that so a lot of our

955
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,500
Solutions in the Sim and all that are

956
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,960
having a Ai and ml capabilities built

957
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,920
into it and similarly any other even for

958
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,500
some of the operations areas I know

959
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,720
um you know they now as part of a

960
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,240
creating a processes and all that they

961
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,820
build Ai and ml capabilities within it

962
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,619
so each of them has a different use

963
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,940
cases

964
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,380
um but at least these are the three four

965
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,900
I know where uh definitely most of the

966
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,380
banks has capabilities according to that

967
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,619
Robo advising I'm sorry uh you will have

968
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,920
Rajesh with you one on one don't worry

969
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,380
uh you know pick up his brains but I am

970
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,660
running short on times I want to I want

971
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,640
to honor that you have a minute to

972
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,760
answer yeah so I just wanted to say that

973
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,880
you know AI uh so I just wanted to the

974
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,800
correlation like earlier we were saying

975
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,599
that okay whether your organization is

976
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,820
breacher or you don't know that you have

977
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,640
been preached and AI tool has been taken

978
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,520
as the foundation to increase the

979
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,140
productivity right we know whether it is

980
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,180
cyber security or as I said like fraud

981
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,180
risk management or even uh you know your

982
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,760
process Automation and all so AI has

983
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,740
been a very good tool where we say that

984
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,320
we have limited uh hands and legs and

985
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,320
brains uh how do we utilize it optimally

986
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,960
and that is where AI is being used but

987
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,940
again AI is a huge term and there are

988
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,220
lot many things about it are you saying

989
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,540
that everything has been implemented

990
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,460
there is no because right from my

991
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,740
colleges I'm learning about Ai and still

992
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,119
there is a lot of research which is

993
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,160
going on in AI so have we implemented

994
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,780
everything this is there's no end to it

995
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,470
honestly

996
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,780
[Music]

997
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,960
okay so one final question because I

998
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,700
will be then shunted out of the room if

999
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,359
I exceed my time okay yeah uh thanks for

1000
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,579
the opportunity uh this is darshan I

1001
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,380
work for Tesco so this question is

1002
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,200
pointed to its uh

1003
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,720
so I see that you are a CSO as well as

1004
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,020
data privacy officer so how do you see

1005
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,160
that uh working in real life I mean do

1006
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
you think it's uh there's some kind of

1007
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,180
uh I mean you're not how do you balance

1008
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,599
both of them keeping in mind that let's

1009
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,359
say data privacy also talks about

1010
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,680
customers data not being used for data

1011
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,900
analytics and stuff like that and also

1012
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,900
security operations coming into uh this

1013
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,579
where you're trying to do it in a secure

1014
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,320
way how do you balance this is there

1015
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,140
some kind of uh I don't know uh how do

1016
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,460
you see that that's the question to you

1017
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,500
so first of all I realized that my

1018
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,040
designation and myself is so vulnerable

1019
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,800
so coming back to giving my perspective

1020
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,260
so what happens is that we look at uh

1021
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,420
with cyber security or data privacy in

1022
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,880
different different angles uh but if you

1023
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,280
look at it the cyber security or data

1024
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,660
privacy you know we need to start

1025
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,700
looking at from the business perspective

1026
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,160
right for example even in the banking

1027
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,500
perspective uh we talk about card data

1028
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,960
security or personal data security and

1029
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,820
we do a lot of processes like product

1030
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,680
review process review business process

1031
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,260
review We engage with the businesses we

1032
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,060
review all the business processes and

1033
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,339
why why we combined with the with the

1034
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,900
cyber security and again whether there's

1035
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,460
a right way wrong way which we don't

1036
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,260
know but potentially we felt like okay

1037
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,960
as a Synergy it goes well so we felt

1038
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,420
like okay why two different people going

1039
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,579
and doing two different studies in

1040
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:54,920
isolation

1041
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,480
rather while we are looking at the

1042
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,180
business process and where where we are

1043
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,220
really having a conversation with the

1044
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,720
business from business perspective

1045
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,280
whether there is a car data or whether

1046
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,560
there is authentication level control

1047
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,359
makers like a make a checker level

1048
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,119
control and the Privacy control so we

1049
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:14,280
need to fix this from the base framework

1050
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,520
itself and therefore we decided to have

1051
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,700
a a single team at least identifying

1052
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,980
what the data is and then eventually you

1053
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,099
have in in privacy you have a lot many

1054
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,339
things like you know your uh right to

1055
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,619
forget right to forget right to

1056
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,720
information and all other things but

1057
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,599
again one team is only going to drive it

1058
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,119
but obviously we will be joined by so

1059
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,760
many people within the company to make

1060
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,500
this as a whole framework so for example

1061
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,599
even in cyber security framework uh when

1062
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,099
we have a council and all we have

1063
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,839
multiple people who are working together

1064
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,180
right the same way this will happen so

1065
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,740
this was a thought process and because

1066
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,380
of that probably I got too tired also

1067
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,200
but there was a logic for that thank you

1068
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,980
so much I think we started with SSC uh

1069
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,880
you know

1070
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,720
sassy minus a uh we went to a lot of

1071
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,119
other places uh during the conversation

1072
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,180
however the purpose of this whole uh

1073
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,300
discussion was that if we can have

1074
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,920
participation and answer the real

1075
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,440
questions from uh some of the

1076
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,380
participants that have put up for us uh

1077
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,099
there's always a scope for more but we

1078
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,560
are bound with the uh with a time frame

1079
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,780
and she's courteous enough to not show

1080
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,760
me your time is over get away from this

1081
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,300
from the stage so thank you so much and

1082
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,640
quite interesting questions from you and

1083
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,859
from the delegates thank you so much
