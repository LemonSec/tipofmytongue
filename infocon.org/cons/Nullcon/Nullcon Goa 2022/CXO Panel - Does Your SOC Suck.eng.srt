1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,359
good afternoon everyone uh I know this

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,700
session is just after lunch so we'll try

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,920
to ask tough questions so that you want

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,080
to know the answers for it and I hope

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,379
everybody history is awake and just I

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,840
hope that people who came know that we

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,720
are not going to talk about soccer

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,060
which is secretary Operation Center

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,519
so yeah uh

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,859
I think we have been introduced and uh

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,660
just one announcement we will take

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,399
questions towards the end because we

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,260
have like come up with a flow for asking

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,520
questions and we want to take you

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,620
through a journey on how the swag has

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,020
been 10 years back how it is currently

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,340
what are the current challenges and how

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,840
it will evolve in the future

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,140
so uh the idea is to just make you take

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,300
you through the Journey nostalgic and

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,980
then what are the challenges and we will

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,620
have lost in 15 minutes for the question

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,360
so

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,480
like let's go with the first question uh

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
and mostly about because everybody has

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,079
their own implementation of Security

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,480
operation Center and everybody thinks

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,479
that hey my sock is mature but before we

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
go into that I don't want the nist

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,500
definition of sock but what is your

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,060
interpretation of Security operation

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,619
Center and what it means for everyone

33
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,140
yeah thank you um

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,159
well uh sock in any organization is

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,040
considered as first line of defense

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,220
and obviously there is an expectation

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,280
that sock should be able to detect

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,460
attacks malicious activities at a very

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,520
early stage in the entire attack phase

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,799
uh to give you an example stock is

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
something similar to what you can call

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,720
as airport security at all the airports

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,479
so if you guys have ever watched on

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,860
National Geographic there's a program

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,220
that comes on Airport security where the

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,280
airport security team watches each and

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,500
every passenger who passes through the

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,200
customs and their job is only to

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
identify out of millions of passengers

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,619
those three or four passengers who might

51
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,679
be doing uh drug trafficking smuggling

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,459
Etc

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,879
and that's the thought process which uh

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,720
I think uh we can use in the sock so

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,780
that we can identify the threats all the

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,140
malicious activities early on and uh

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,020
make sure that we have and secure

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,120
environment in the organization so

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,120
that's my definition of stock you want

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,860
to add your like you have been a veteran

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,860
in stock side so please go ahead yes I

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,400
know you mentioned uh we should mention

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,660
nistcs if I I'm gonna just use that

64
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,420
definition so for me you know the detect

65
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,540
respond recover aspects is sock and I

66
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
totally agree with shweta like you know

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,640
we are the first line of defense

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
um and my example is similar to hers

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,420
like you know like airport security I

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,420
like uh medieval fantasy movies so you

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,280
know they show the old castles and Fort

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,560
and two guys standing in front of the

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
gate letting people in and identifying

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,160
people who are not so I think that's

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,400
tier one saw but sock is pretty much

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,959
I feel like you know it's much much

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,480
wider uh like I said you know detect

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,580
response yeah I would hold my thought

79
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,620
because when somebody says airport and

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,840
security nine level comes into mind like

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,659
9 11 was a kind of a moment where

82
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,640
everything changes has there been such a

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
movement on the circuit operation side

84
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,019
but for later but we will go to Vivek

85
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,440
first yeah sure uh for us right I'm

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,140
looking it from a product perspective uh

87
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,959
stock is two false right one is how we

88
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,180
are protecting our infrastructure and

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,519
there it is more like how do I collect

90
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,379
all the information from every place how

91
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,440
do I uh consolidate that and how do the

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,299
incident response happens on a timely

93
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,159
manner right so that's that's something

94
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,799
that constantly happens and then as a

95
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,360
product that how we provide to a

96
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,879
customer as a managed service where it

97
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,120
happens that we call it the incidents

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
happening across customers and then see

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,280
how how things are evolving what are the

100
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,959
patterns what are they anomalies

101
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,879
evolving and then how do we just respond

102
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,400
faster right this is how we treat shock

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
coming one from customers perspective

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,660
providing a managed solution having a

105
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,959
strong stock team looking at how various

106
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,840
things are working and uh what are the

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,400
various incidents happening across

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,380
customers and how do you correlate it

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,720
and respond quickly right so because

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,660
you're reacted we are discussing so any

111
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,000
uh I know everybody loves like a story

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,220
right like if you you have to just give

113
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,620
me some incident or some Stellar moment

114
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,600
on the operation side which you recall

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,180
or what happened see even I mean just

116
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,160
looking at recent examples right like

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,000
what happened uh when uh say the war

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,740
started right and Ukraine war has

119
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
started and other things incidentally

120
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,060
you started seeing lot of attacks

121
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,460
happening across boat just not Russia

122
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,880
it's both Russians and Ukraine there

123
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
were a lot of attacks that was coming in

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
right so we had to uh look at it and

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,720
then improve the response and then

126
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,940
improve the threat levels for requests

127
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,860
coming from these areas so those are the

128
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,139
things that immediately bubbles up if

129
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,320
you have a strong stock system in place

130
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,060
and there's a strong monitoring in place

131
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,000
and ability to handle anomalies at the

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
scale yeah I I'll just add to what he

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
said so this is an example of

134
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,479
situational awareness and

135
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,900
when this whole War started I remember

136
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,139
connecting to my uh business partners at

137
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,580
Microsoft Google uh Palo alto's uh I

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,080
told them my problem statement is

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,259
twofold okay because India is

140
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,560
considering to abstain from uh taking a

141
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,520
decision and Russia is a friend of India

142
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,220
at the same time U.S Europe is also

143
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,280
friends of India so the attacks are

144
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,500
getting launched by Russians onto the

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
other side as well as from the West to

146
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,600
the Russia so India is kind of more or

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,139
less getting sandwiched in both the uh

148
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,360
you know parties so I have a two-fold

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,479
problem which I need to address so uh

150
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,280
this is part of situational awareness

151
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,979
which we need to think as part of cyber

152
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,660
defense as a whole information security

153
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,240
as a whole and not just limiting to

154
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,000
stock yeah so yeah it may be a similar

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
question what is your most aha or

156
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,720
Steeler moment on your the journey so

157
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
far like in the Security operation side

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
so I think I'll just follow the trend

159
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,139
here like and since you're talking about

160
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,639
war

161
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,180
um I got interested in security uh after

162
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,680
I read that about structure like you

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,440
know the whole thing so for me that was

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
a just going through that book

165
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,380
um had multiple aha moments and I

166
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,639
decided you know this is something which

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,740
I really want to explore uh so since

168
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,600
I've been working in this industry I

169
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,960
come from a SRE background so for me the

170
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,979
biggest I think uh Revelation was in Sr

171
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,720
you know everything is time like

172
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,460
sensitive you have to get things up back

173
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,100
and running very quickly but uh

174
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,280
incidents on the security side uh are

175
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
equally intense

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,840
but there's a different version of time

177
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
which comes in right like you can

178
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,800
actually sit back and sometimes when you

179
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,300
know what the attacker is trying to do

180
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,460
or you're curious you just wait

181
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,800
sometimes and which is what was very

182
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,259
alien to me when I first got into this

183
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,479
side so I think those things definitely

184
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
are you know aha moments for me so I

185
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,940
think definitely stuccinate was a

186
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,900
milestone like

187
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,400
for quite some time the stock sniper I

188
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
think definitely a lot of other

189
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,840
incidents in recent solar winds rather

190
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,020
have been also taking the news and the

191
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
social Ukraine war the most interesting

192
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,759
thing which I witnessed well it talks

193
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
about the preparedness of the Cyber side

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
lot of people who started targeting

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,639
Russian servers the Russians were

196
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,500
responding by saying hey I am a teapot

197
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,319
and that is HTTP 418 error saying that

198
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,240
hey server is like so they were able to

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,819
direct such uh attack on their

200
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,139
infrastructure and they were like trying

201
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,960
to mock the people from the other side

202
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,419
so uh that's that's the fun thing which

203
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,759
I learned with this new one

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
so um so this is about the first

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,539
introduction around the security

206
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,699
operations what it means what the

207
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,259
panelists have been through and what is

208
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,320
there there have been their moments and

209
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,659
so coming to the later part where we

210
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,799
want to

211
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,539
like everybody's like hey does your soft

212
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,640
sucks but like what are we going to talk

213
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,300
about in this the theme is like how do

214
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,300
we know that my sock is a mature uh what

215
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,100
are the key things to consider to

216
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,360
evaluate if you are my security

217
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
operations center is at which level of

218
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,700
maturity so that is one uh question

219
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,380
which I have which will talk about the

220
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,380
visibility the meter tdp's attack

221
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,620
framework and all that so um Sweta you

222
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,440
want to take a go at it uh yeah sure

223
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
so one important thing is uh when you're

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
building a sock or when you are

225
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,660
sustaining a sock at whatever stage it

226
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,560
may be

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,100
visibility is very important and what I

228
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,260
mean by visibility is not just the

229
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,779
network level visibility or endpoint

230
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,420
level visibility the business visibility

231
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,860
is also important okay uh your detection

232
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,640
rules should ensure that you address the

233
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,740
risks that are posed for the business

234
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,880
okay

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,459
because end of the day I think many of

236
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,620
the organizations since many years have

237
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,560
started calling cyber security risk as

238
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,899
one of their business risks okay I

239
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,940
remember in my previous organization

240
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,459
five years ago they actually called it

241
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,580
into the annual report saying that these

242
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,620
are the top 10 risks the organization

243
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,380
faces cyber security is one of the key

244
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,899
risks that was identified uh at that

245
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,320
time right so visibility from the

246
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,120
network point of view from the endpoint

247
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
point of view from the user point of

248
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,220
view uh location point of view and

249
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,140
business point of view is is very

250
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,560
important many a times what happens is

251
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,440
you integrate a lot of uh infrastructure

252
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,080
you integrate firewalls uh you integrate

253
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,720
Enterprise proxy but then there is some

254
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,560
remote location uh operating some small

255
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,140
business function which nobody has

256
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,620
visibility and that may not be part of

257
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,660
your Enterprise security control

258
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,000
ecosystem just to take an example I have

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
seen these cases where there isn't

260
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,980
firewall at a particular location it is

261
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,660
a standalone firewall it is not

262
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,579
reporting to a central console for

263
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,600
example if it's a Palo Alto firewall the

264
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,459
central console of Palo Alto call is

265
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,980
called as Panorama so that firewall is

266
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,899
not even visible in the central console

267
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,180
of the firewall right and it's a

268
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,100
standalone how will stock get that

269
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,920
visibility because the tools that are

270
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,620
used in stock is primarily the Sim Tool

271
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,860
uh it doesn't have that capability of

272
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,899
doing a discovery and identifying the

273
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,820
Assets in your organization that's not

274
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,640
how it works so there is some amount of

275
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,579
manual Intervention which can be solved

276
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,459
by having a proper process inter

277
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,680
functional or interdepartmental process

278
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,440
okay especially on the new deployments

279
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,260
that happen the new changes that happen

280
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,579
are

281
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,860
the existing infrastructure whenever it

282
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,260
undergoes a change it is important that

283
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,540
we make sure that the it organization

284
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,760
keeps the security organization and very

285
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,100
specifically the stock informed about

286
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,500
those changes

287
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,579
so I'll just stop at that and see I

288
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,200
would like to know more about like uh

289
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
when we say visibility but what about

290
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,200
the auto Discovery like they're like

291
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,480
definitely happens advice and all the

292
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,820
other problems so but yeah uh what's

293
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
your view about this Yogi like so I

294
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,740
agree with shweta like mostly with what

295
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,200
she said about visibility

296
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,860
um

297
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,100
this is maturity doesn't come in one day

298
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,560
right like it takes a while to get to a

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,260
certain stage so I think every company

300
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,019
is a different stage of maturity how we

301
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,760
Define maturity in stock like we have a

302
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,680
lot of Frameworks which you know give

303
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
you a good idea on like micro attack

304
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,339
framework and like you know there's a

305
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,680
you can use scenarios from that

306
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
um but one

307
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,360
one area I can I think I've heard some

308
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,899
someone say this so I'm paraphrasing but

309
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,200
the question is not if some company is

310
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,760
going to be breached it's when

311
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,860
like it's it's just a given at this

312
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,480
point right so I think the maturity

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,500
which

314
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,820
um I think about ways like how many

315
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,560
levels or layers of protection you can

316
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
build in and visibility is definitely

317
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,139
one of the key aspects of that there's a

318
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,959
whole uh plethora of things we can think

319
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,540
of like in our case we have you know we

320
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,339
we focus a lot on process people

321
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,399
technology so when I talk about process

322
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,040
it's about you know run books uh doing

323
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,320
tabletop exercises you know doing all of

324
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,480
that things and people obviously we want

325
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,899
to invest in skills and training and so

326
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,579
it's you know it's the whole gamut of

327
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,620
things like you just have to do it and

328
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,380
the best thing to evaluate how mature

329
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,740
your firm is is to you know either get

330
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,760
someone from like a third party external

331
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,200
uh something like manly into something

332
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,300
to come and you know benchmark you so

333
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,360
that gives you a good sense of sure uh

334
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,980
if you want to add

335
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,160
ah from our perspective right how we

336
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,980
look at maturity is uh and from the

337
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,740
stock perspective right it is about uh

338
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,160
visibility collecting informations then

339
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,139
Consulting it and then the most

340
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,420
important part is about a response right

341
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,420
how quickly are you able to respond

342
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,639
um and nowadays just response is not

343
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,560
enough reporting is also becoming

344
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,260
mandatory so how mature are you on that

345
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,839
front right you have compliance mandates

346
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,060
where you have to report incidents in

347
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,760
very timely manner so how are you

348
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,860
looking at it in a holistic manner right

349
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,660
and which stage of the maturity level

350
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,660
are you in at and from where we see it

351
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,880
in the industry it's more like people

352
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,100
are good at visibility side of things I

353
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,720
mean they are getting the the reporting

354
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,300
side is also getting there but the

355
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,279
response part right that's that's where

356
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,740
I mean the when the challenges still

357
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,839
remain yeah so maybe

358
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,540
um I also want to have an audience uh

359
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,699
poll sort of thing like just a show of

360
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,160
hand so how many of you have seen like

361
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,540
the meter attack framework being

362
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,160
implemented and somebody actually

363
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,920
mapping the ttps and like hey do we have

364
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,480
security controls in place and being

365
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,860
followed in your own organizations

366
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,320
diligently

367
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,779
wow that is a good number what is the

368
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,920
current miter attack version

369
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,279
that is to the audience

370
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,380
11. how many tactics are there

371
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,420
how many seconds we are hiring right now

372
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,279
how many situal

373
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,920
okay one two

374
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,399
14 who's at 14. one okay now everybody's

375
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,880
saying 14 okay so there are 14 because

376
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,060
um from the version nine onwards uh the

377
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,639
pre- attack and the attack uh mattresses

378
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,620
have been merged so that's how you have

379
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,660
14 tactics

380
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,519
um how uh how many techniques

381
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,560
any guess

382
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,300
more than 150 okay

383
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,240
too low

384
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,899
exact number is 222.

385
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,060
so that's version 11.

386
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,440
so

387
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,260
now you cannot have the detections

388
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,839
across all these tactics and techniques

389
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,399
in your stock

390
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,860
uh stock currently in many uh cases is a

391
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,740
reactive function only if it gets the

392
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,860
signals it can build correlation rules

393
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,920
and identify those signals as malicious

394
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,740
right so most of the rules that you

395
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,560
build in stock are static condition

396
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,220
based where you Define a threshold okay

397
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,620
um X number of failures in X minutes

398
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,579
just a simple example right uh and

399
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,199
therefore it is important to understand

400
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,779
that if you say that I have implemented

401
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,120
Maita attack framework it does not

402
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,040
necessarily mean you have implemented

403
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,060
detection across all the 222 techniques

404
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,880
and it is even miter says in their FAQ

405
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,680
that it is not possible to cover all the

406
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,839
hundred because of various reasons if

407
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,660
you are an 100 on-prem organization

408
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,699
there are tactics techniques which are

409
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,440
specific to Cloud environment you just

410
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,619
cannot implement it uh if you don't have

411
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,419
certain security controls implemented

412
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,339
for example if you don't have an

413
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,179
endpoint DLP or a network DLP those uh

414
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,339
specific tactics and techniques

415
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,260
associated with let's say data

416
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,540
exploration uh you may not be able to

417
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,520
build rules around it because you don't

418
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,799
have the security control to throw those

419
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,679
signals into the SIM yeah yeah so you

420
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,020
were actually like caught me ahead

421
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,299
so because we are at nulcon I was like

422
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,160
more curious about also from maturity

423
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,080
perspective like uh we have script

424
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,120
queries we have

425
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,640
because we have purple team red team and

426
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,460
we have apts so if I'm talking about

427
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,860
sock preparedness and detecting this

428
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,980
sort of things so uh maybe a mid-level

429
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,799
mature sock what do you think like uh

430
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,480
what sort of attacks you will able to

431
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,020
detect at least

432
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,380
uh I think we all must get our Basics

433
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,179
right okay

434
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,820
uh you have a firewall

435
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,919
it's an internet facing firewall or a

436
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,919
perimeter firewall as it is also called

437
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,140
and you have a rule on that firewall any

438
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,020
any what does any any stand for

439
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,440
anybody

440
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,480
what does that mean what is any any any

441
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,980
excellent source destination Services of

442
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,299
Oats

443
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,059
okay if you are having such kind of a

444
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,000
rule on your firewall at an Enterprise

445
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
firewall internet facing firewall then

446
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,799
obviously you will have a lot of attacks

447
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,960
coming your way your firewall will be

448
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,020
flooded with events okay second

449
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,640
important thing is

450
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,860
you are not enabling logging itself on

451
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,900
your machines okay this typically

452
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,919
happens in the server environment uh

453
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,039
typically on the Windows servers Linux

454
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,059
servers databases applications uh you

455
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,700
don't enable OS level logins okay

456
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,919
because of that you don't get the

457
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,559
signals from those servers coming into

458
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,580
your sim

459
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,220
okay a lot of people say that okay we

460
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,080
have implemented domain controller and

461
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,360
we can you know pop forward those logs

462
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,020
but then there are local logins created

463
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,880
on the servers with administrative

464
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
privileges which stock will not have

465
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,860
visibility unless the logging on those

466
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,780
servers is enabled and those logs are

467
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,059
pushed or pointed to the Sim and then

468
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,539
you build use case on cases on top of it

469
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,000
so again I will go back to the miter

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,940
attack framework if you have gone

471
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,740
through how The Miser attack framework

472
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,860
is organized after describing tactics

473
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,720
techniques and sub techniques it also

474
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,179
gives a mapping of those to the attack

475
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,419
groups how do you do the detections what

476
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,039
is possible to detect what is not

477
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
possible to detect okay it gives a very

478
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,500
elaborate way of uh you know it

479
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,120
basically helps the stock to understand

480
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,640
what is it that they can do and what

481
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,799
scenarios they can build what events

482
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,080
they need to collect to address the

483
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,000
scenarios and make sure that those

484
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,880
detections trigger in the environment

485
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,220
so Yogi maybe like you have been seeing

486
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,200
also a lot of incidents and with the new

487
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,240
certain directory you're on the hook so

488
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
you want to add add like how the

489
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,440
preparedness and how ready we are to

490
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,260
respond and uh maybe like with this new

491
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,299
certain directory sort of thing

492
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,539
yeah so uh I think we already had a

493
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,299
certain session earlier so I won't

494
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,520
comment on that but

495
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,460
just to further shweta's point right so

496
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,940
preparedness that's what yeah so I think

497
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,600
[Music]

498
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,760
like you know now we are moving on to

499
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,780
you know there's a lot of different

500
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,360
environments we operate into now like

501
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,940
cloud is a big one so things change

502
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,580
everything is evolving

503
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,799
um earlier used to be ioc is you know

504
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,600
very important now ioas are becoming

505
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,100
very important you know you know

506
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,160
indicators of attack so like what

507
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
so might the way one of the ways might

508
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,059
attack framework is used is you it it

509
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,760
helps you visualize scenarios and then

510
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,160
plan according to them and so the the

511
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,320
maturity aspect comes in by that like

512
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,200
you know how well you use these uh

513
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
techniques and how well you can predict

514
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,179
what's gonna happen so going back to our

515
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,980
definition of sock right so now you're

516
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,960
bringing in threat Intel as well into

517
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,240
this whole equation so all of these

518
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,159
things working together is essentially

519
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,299
you know

520
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,100
um where we are going with in the future

521
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,460
yeah like if I can add supplement to

522
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,559
that question so what could be impact of

523
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,299
like we have seen recently a lot of Red

524
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,179
Team Tools being leaked so how soon you

525
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,400
think like uh once that zero day sort of

526
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,260
thing happens or like great teams tools

527
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,320
are getting leaked how fast we can

528
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,299
detect those animals like do we wait on

529
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,919
the vendors signature detection like to

530
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,440
be added to our info hour like we do

531
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,159
something on the Fly okay yeah so I

532
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,080
think this is going into a different

533
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,940
territory but like we talked about

534
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,280
hybrid socks like earlier in our before

535
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,799
we were talking before the session so

536
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,320
hybrid socks is one way like and by

537
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
hybrid stock we mean like you know where

538
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,520
you have your internal sock you may be

539
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,620
partnering with external Partners like

540
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,200
crowdstrike or some other you know uh

541
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
vendor who's helping you at the same

542
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,159
time and so yeah you have different

543
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,919
flavors of that but one way to prepare

544
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,600
for these kind of thing like you know

545
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,120
solo wins for example like who would

546
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,020
have

547
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,940
who would have warned a company that hey

548
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,220
solo wins is coming so there are a lot

549
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,320
of uh they're one of the advantages of

550
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,380
hybrid stock is you can have these

551
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,360
relationships which help you better

552
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,700
prepare for these kind of things so like

553
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,980
a mid-level mature company might be able

554
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,240
to ward off like script kitties but uh

555
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,600
more mature uh organization might have a

556
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,240
hybrid soft kind of a model

557
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,000
so so I think uh Vivek you want to add

558
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,919
something to this

559
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,780
but I think I think I agree with what

560
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,059
they are saying right and you you

561
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,039
it depends I mean it's all about

562
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,380
you have different detection techniques

563
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,299
now then how do you correlate those

564
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,000
right and uh maturity or how do you

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,940
respond faster would come down from uh

566
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,679
that's the stock team understands the

567
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,179
various detection techniques happening

568
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,780
if not are you asking the vendors to go

569
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,980
back and then give the right

570
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,659
informations for you and is the

571
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,220
different techniques being configured

572
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,020
well and all those things right it comes

573
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,059
down to that and that's really means it

574
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,360
I I'll just take one example here

575
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,679
um how many of you remember Wanna Cry

576
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,700
all of them okay so what was the root

577
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,260
cause of one Accra happening

578
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,159
somebody said

579
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,799
missing patches of water

580
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,960
what is eternal blue

581
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,419
smb1 vulnerability when was the patch

582
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,720
released for that vulnerability

583
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,240
March of that year right and when did

584
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,880
Wanna Cry actually happened me

585
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,760
right so we almost had one and a half to

586
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,820
two months to ensure that the patching

587
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,179
is done but then we have various reasons

588
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,539
of not doing that patch I till 2019

589
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,400
there were reports circulating that

590
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,700
there are uh you know systems which are

591
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,460
vulnerable to smd1 and this is not just

592
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,760
Windows machines but any

593
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,120
um infra which uses Microsoft's smb1 uh

594
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,679
in their infrastructure is vulnerable

595
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,460
right so uh now how do you make sure

596
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
that the sock is able to understand

597
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,620
these vulnerabilities and create

598
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,559
detections on it so what does smb1

599
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,659
what are the ports related to smb1

600
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,059
okay 443

601
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,400
or 445

602
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:12,539
445 others 139 138 137 right so uh what

603
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,720
sock can do is Define detection rules

604
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,520
for inbound and outbound communication

605
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,960
on those codes

606
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,200
very specifically which are allowed okay

607
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,480
and then deny once you can take it on

608
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,860
later as part of your additional

609
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,440
analysis so this is the approach when it

610
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,480
comes to vulnerability which is known

611
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,240
you can use it as a detection in the

612
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,500
song

613
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,720
so thanks to thanks Twitter for summing

614
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,539
it up um and I also have like basically

615
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,000
I also have curiosity for example we do

616
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,039
a lot of operations and we do a lot of

617
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,179
correlation

618
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,039
so one thing with correlation is

619
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,380
definitely attributing the incident to

620
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,960
any apts or threat actors who but what

621
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,659
on the internal side like do we also

622
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,059
have something to basically tag identity

623
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,279
to the incidents and how can we know

624
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,419
that hey

625
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,880
who is being targeted inside the inside

626
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,700
the organization uh some something on

627
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,159
that specific threat to Intel do you

628
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,380
want to take that yeah so

629
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,779
you know they're they're a threat Intel

630
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,880
again like how you get your Intel can

631
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,039
vary you know based on the size of your

632
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
company uh but if you have like an

633
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,380
in-house threat Intel team they

634
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,080
they should be the ones driving the

635
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,960
detection strategy so you know there are

636
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,659
a lot of inputs you know which can help

637
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,059
but if you want to just have a focused

638
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,740
strategy I think that that's a really

639
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,740
good way of going about doing it and the

640
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,299
way they do it is you know multiple

641
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,380
fronts

642
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,039
um

643
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,140
like you mentioned the APT actors but

644
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,700
yeah so mostly my question is around

645
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,380
like active directories that they have

646
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,419
been the target for all vectors hey

647
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,940
let's get the people's identity like I

648
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,679
want uh admin access and then then

649
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,299
basically you get the keys of Kingdom

650
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,220
maybe you can do a golden attack or

651
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,020
roasting whatever but if once you have

652
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,940
the hold of active directory and then

653
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,340
you can simply use that so maybe Twitter

654
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,799
you want to add something other identity

655
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,520
um so basically we are trying to address

656
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,340
um two things one is an external attack

657
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,340
gaining access to your uh valid accounts

658
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,679
which is one of the techniques under

659
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,059
four tactics of miter and uh inside our

660
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:27,419
thread Okay so Sim coupled with ueba uh

661
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,659
is more likely to give you that Insight

662
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:31,559
uh because

663
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,679
ueba has that uh very good analytical

664
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,159
module uh for example if I am

665
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
let's say I'm using uh g-suit in my

666
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,140
organization okay or even o365 okay

667
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,600
uh if you are logging from a compromised

668
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,779
device okay you get an alert that there

669
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,880
is a user login that has happened from a

670
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,460
compromise device okay

671
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,440
if you are logging from multiple

672
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,020
locations simultaneously which are

673
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,559
geographically distant locations uh you

674
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
get an alert that is something which

675
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,059
ueba can you know stitch together based

676
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,020
on the uh identity related events and

677
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,980
give that context to sim to further

678
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,320
investigate and uh you know analyze

679
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,659
really in depth so

680
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,659
ueba coupled with Sim I think is a great

681
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,080
combination to identify such attacks uh

682
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,880
we make you you want to add anything to

683
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,220
this user entity Behavior so yeah those

684
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,679
who have not heard the term ueb is

685
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,260
entity Behavior Analysis so whoever's

686
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,840
the user entity uh there happen like

687
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,919
basically

688
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,100
when I was doing my engineering uh we

689
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,600
were talking about anomaly detection and

690
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,279
intrusion prevention system and that

691
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,740
thing has definitely come a long way

692
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,460
maybe uh we can take as big as uh this

693
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,960
is the current situation where Smitha

694
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,039
was saying hey there are a lot of static

695
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,720
rules still like we are talking about

696
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,299
which port a very static binding maybe

697
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,919
some people change their RDP Port from

698
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,200
3389 to something else or like having

699
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,059
run this not to use the commonly used

700
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:09,360
ports to just have some deception uh but

701
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,179
where do we see this industry going

702
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,700
forward like uh is that would be like

703
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,220
too hard with all the kind of perimeter

704
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,020
getting diminished and our workloads are

705
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,940
running everywhere on the edge in the

706
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,820
cloud uh multi-cloud and like we have

707
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,640
something like hybrid on-prem so with

708
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
the boundaries getting diminished where

709
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,760
we don't have perimeter we are looking

710
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,000
at zero trust jtn is sort of a lot of

711
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,440
companies are coming with that approach

712
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,600
as well so when

713
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,700
would it be very radical to think like

714
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,480
hey

715
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,659
um a world without sock like do you

716
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:43,860
think we can get rid of the security

717
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,200
Operation Center and because everybody

718
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,360
has been talking about AIML blockchain

719
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,480
and all the jargons and geotrists but um

720
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,360
will there be a uh soon we can see an AI

721
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,399
powered stock where human intervention

722
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,740
is like less than no one like this is

723
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,460
like

724
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,860
a good sock fighting warm

725
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,740
a bad AI board or something

726
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,899
so uh see AIML is something that is like

727
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,840
right I don't want to throw it down

728
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,020
right but aimless is there and it will

729
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,360
definitely help in lot of those

730
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,399
detection techniques and even automated

731
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,520
response right but it is a utopian world

732
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,000
to think that AIML is going to like

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,340
replace the manual intervention right I

734
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,919
mean how we see it and how we think

735
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,539
about machine learning and everything is

736
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,539
machine learning is should be used

737
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,700
to uh to analyze uh huge data right and

738
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,620
ability to analyze which is yeah not

739
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,260
humanly possible but then uh pass on the

740
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,120
anomalies detector or the relations that

741
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,940
is identified but let human

742
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,640
be there to respond right or at least

743
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,440
decide whether just right or wrong I

744
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,419
mean I think you're discussing and you

745
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,700
don't want AIML to decide whether okay

746
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,980
for some reason the system is saying

747
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,860
that hey the CEO's laptop is misbehaving

748
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,179
and then I go and wipe it off right

749
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,039
that's not something that you want to do

750
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,260
and you don't want such instruments I

751
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,059
mean coming from an application security

752
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,480
perspective how we see it as uh even a

753
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,520
minute's downtime in an application cost

754
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,640
cost companies right and in that cases

755
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,419
you don't want AML to to kind of okay

756
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,600
it's seeing a huge surge of data or

757
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,480
requests coming from a business area

758
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,120
like say say from Singapore and all of a

759
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,740
sudden the block Singapore which is

760
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,899
their biggest business centers so that

761
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,899
will cause huge huge issues right so I

762
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:46,559
don't see uh aaml replacing it obviously

763
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,419
it will be complemented so I think you

764
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,059
are killing uh like a lot of Buzz here I

765
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,440
think so everybody has been selling

766
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,480
silver bullets in secret industry like

767
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,000
hey my aim will solve this problem like

768
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,779
you definitely killed a lot of birds

769
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:03,240
I'm not killing it I mean again see we I

770
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,039
mean nobody that's

771
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,020
that's lower bullet right I mean the

772
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,179
problem with how industry is trading

773
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,580
AIML is that that is the Silver Bullet

774
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,919
which is going to solve everything I

775
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,480
mean I don't see that happening very

776
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,419
fast okay I I'll just add to it

777
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,000
um anybody who is used as your Sentinel

778
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,880
as their Sim in their environments

779
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,360
what is the ml based rule in Sentinel

780
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,600
called

781
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,260
Fusion so Fusion is ml based rule which

782
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,419
addresses at least 120 different

783
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,679
scenarios

784
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,140
which otherwise in a traditional Sim

785
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,179
like oxide or QR you would have to

786
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,720
create either 120 static detection rules

787
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,440
or a combination of those 120 use cases

788
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,700
so that is where ml can help and uh

789
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,919
second thing is uh

790
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,200
human intelligence

791
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,299
can never be replaced with artificial

792
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,840
intelligence is my personal opinion I'll

793
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,580
give a small I'll give a small example

794
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,159
uh how many of you know the dabbawalas

795
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,440
from Mumbai

796
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,240
almost everybody

797
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,480
now when their case study was taken up I

798
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,039
think it was in Harvard if I recollect

799
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,419
correctly

800
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,700
they had zero automation

801
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,019
right everything is manual process but a

802
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,080
seamless process so can you run a sock

803
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,899
without automation the answer is yes but

804
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,360
to what extent that is a questionable uh

805
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,580
thing because it all depends on how big

806
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,679
your organization is how many signals

807
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,679
you are getting into the stock and uh

808
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,740
how is your attack surface expanding

809
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,399
okay so I would say that ML and AI will

810
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,980
complement uh the stock but not

811
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,140
necessarily replace it and the human

812
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,000
intelligence element is very important

813
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,919
yeah I think

814
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,960
the trend which is going on is like hey

815
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,000
how much logs you are collecting and I

816
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,279
think sometimes the Splunk is the big

817
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,679
bet like everybody has so much data like

818
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,619
the storage cost has gone like I I feel

819
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,560
like I should buy that but yeah there

820
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,899
has been a different uh things but uh

821
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,060
Yogi you want to take a take something

822
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,918
on like last closing comment before we

823
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,139
take any questions on like a world

824
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,119
without how outrageous it is to think

825
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,699
like one thing I'll be without a job so

826
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,800
I don't want to imagine a world without

827
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,460
thought but um I feel no I mean I

828
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,619
completely to watch it I said I like and

829
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,300
what Vivek was saying earlier there is

830
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,199
really

831
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,839
no replacement for human intelligence

832
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,780
all the tools and everything are meant

833
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,020
to help humans make you know informed

834
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,359
decisions quicker we don't want all the

835
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,099
noise so we really do depend on the

836
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,020
tools but not

837
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,300
as a replacement it's more of an

838
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,040
addition yeah I will convey this message

839
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,380
like there are a lot of companies who

840
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,060
are saying that hey we can potentially

841
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,160
prevent zero days from happening use our

842
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,560
ML and AI so yeah otherwise you can

843
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,460
expect the robot the rajinikanth movie

844
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,040
Terminator so let's go back like and

845
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,200
questions now the question time oh I see

846
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
a lot of hands there

847
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
um

848
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,650
yeah

849
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,200
[Music]

850
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,380
hello hey hi everyone a quick query so

851
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,359
recently pandemic happened it changed

852
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,579
the world in many ways right so what

853
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,859
change did it you know brought to soft

854
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,900
like when I say change in terms of say

855
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,359
being remote or remote friendly and how

856
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:38,460
it changed sock as an industry maybe

857
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,920
right now or going forward

858
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,400
so I can uh yeah

859
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,140
um so for us it was actually a very

860
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,920
happy uh change like not to take away

861
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,820
from the covet pandemic itself but

862
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,500
because of the work from home initially

863
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,300
it was very challenging because we had

864
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,920
to instantly

865
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,380
shift to a you know work from home model

866
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,119
we have to get all the right to the

867
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,839
security aspect of it but what we saw is

868
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:09,420
one like you know we got more employee

869
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,000
morale boost somehow

870
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,859
um we were able to hire more easily

871
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,780
because we also operate in night shift

872
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,400
so people were like okay we don't have

873
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,440
to commute in the night we were able to

874
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,339
hire uh more and I think in general

875
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,880
at least for tier one so it made up

876
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,339
somehow surprisingly a more positive

877
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,579
impact to the work environment now I do

878
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,200
have the other side of the story also

879
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,180
where we hired a lot of people during

880
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,700
the pandemic and they are missing out on

881
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,099
knowing the team like I met like

882
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,480
right here right now I met him for the

883
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,800
first time but he was hired nearly two

884
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
years ago so I think that's the downside

885
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,020
of this whole thing but but a happy

886
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,420
stance was that we did get some positive

887
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,300
thing out of that as well yeah and just

888
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,640
to take it forward from there um when

889
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,320
the pandemic happened I was with a

890
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
different organization and uh in our

891
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,020
sock at that time uh we already had l2s

892
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,359
and l3s uh you know remote access

893
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,000
enabled so it was matter of quickly

894
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,520
enabling that for L1 so from the ways of

895
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,940
working nothing much changed but what

896
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,520
changed is the amount and pressure of

897
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,420
because new technologies got implemented

898
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,060
VPN which was restricted to maybe few

899
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,800
thousands of employees had to be

900
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,500
extended to more than one lakh or two

901
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,000
lakh employees which means more

902
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,579
infrastructure more events right so

903
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,619
ingesting those events was a big

904
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,200
challenge because we had an on-prem SIM

905
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,660
EPS became a bottleneck events per

906
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,700
second so we had to increase our

907
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,940
licenses I think uh in just six months

908
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,740
we renewed our licenses or got

909
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,460
additional licenses maybe twice

910
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,800
so there was tremendous amount of work a

911
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,960
lot of servers had to be put in place to

912
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,980
address the bcpdr so again ingesting log

913
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,260
events from that and then making sure

914
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,420
that they don't just ingest the locks

915
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,880
but they also reflect in the detection

916
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,579
rules you're ingesting the loss but

917
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,380
whatever you're existing is not getting

918
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,140
correlated is another problem so again a

919
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,000
thorough validation of making sure that

920
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,099
those infrastructure is part of the

921
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,980
rules also it was a big challenge for us

922
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,140
uh we have any yeah

923
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,880
well we'll take a couple of more

924
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,339
questions

925
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,680
okay so I think this question uh started

926
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,540
when the pandemic started and laptops

927
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,220
and desktops were sent to people's home

928
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,220
the cmdb went for a toss and it

929
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,220
continues as uh as on date also that the

930
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,680
companies are not having a complete cmdb

931
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,079
with them so how is the visibility

932
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,420
Factor being taken care of by the sock

933
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,900
teams to ensure and help the it have a

934
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,720
complete cmdb because infosex is it will

935
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,640
do it and IIT says how exactly that's

936
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,940
always a conflict

937
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,839
so

938
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,760
um I see I think

939
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,640
um one thing is clear as as a leader

940
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,640
this is something which I follow is uh

941
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,320
closely connect with the leaders in the

942
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,960
it organization and the people who work

943
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,859
on ground that's very important so if

944
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,240
you connect with a leader at a high

945
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,440
level you will get a high level

946
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,180
information but if you connect with a

947
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,040
person who is actually implementing a

948
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,780
firewall you will get more information

949
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,740
okay and make your l1's L2 l3s also

950
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,260
connect at the ground level once you

951
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,480
establish that connect you can define a

952
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,160
proper process which is the change

953
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,619
management process and how infosec can

954
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,079
get visibility infosec I think should be

955
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,820
part of all the cab meetings at least

956
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,060
the emergency and the high or critical

957
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,920
severity changes

958
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,839
thank you so uh yeah also so some of the

959
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
organizations may have multiple Cloud

960
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Technologies so how do we protect from

961
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
apds and what are the challenges we are

962
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,140
facing uh when the organization having

963
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,520
multiple Cloud Technologies

964
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:08,630
he is in my team as a biased questions

965
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,900
[Music]

966
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,520
yeah

967
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,820
maybe

968
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,380
I'll go like you know what we are doing

969
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,060
so he's going through a bunch of

970
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,980
training so that's where I think part of

971
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,960
the reason of that question that one

972
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,640
thing is obviously you have to it's not

973
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
easy

974
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,540
even though we sometimes say that it all

975
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,160
Cloud technology is similar but

976
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,500
everything you know everything is

977
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,660
different so every single time we

978
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,060
onboard something and that's what we're

979
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,000
seeing is you have to retrain the

980
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,380
Personnel you have to go through a lot

981
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,900
of you know tooling training

982
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,359
um folks have to get certified and it's

983
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,839
the same analyst doing that role

984
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:50,940
um you know doing handling customer

985
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,560
queries and also then trying to figure

986
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,420
out you know what what the attacks is

987
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,400
going to look like so I think there is

988
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,160
definitely a to answer your question the

989
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,440
first question so there's an increased

990
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,599
sense of burnout as well in in this

991
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,119
scenario so that's what we experience as

992
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:06,680
well

993
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,260
[Music]

994
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,839
I think when it comes to uh multi-cloud

995
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,700
uh environment

996
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,420
um

997
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,359
you can uh do definitely one thing you

998
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:22,740
use the native uh tools for example AWS

999
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,720
AWS has guard Duty gcp has uh security

1000
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,920
Center or and

1001
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,380
Azure also has ASC Azure security center

1002
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,480
now they call it as as your Defender for

1003
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,160
cloud I think that is something which

1004
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,800
you can you know enable uh if you are

1005
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,619
using Azure predominantly one good thing

1006
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,240
in Azure is that you can have something

1007
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,820
called as Azure Arc we which can cover

1008
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,339
your workloads in other Cloud

1009
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,200
environments and you can get those

1010
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,839
signals in your Sentinel and then of

1011
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,820
course the correlation rules which you

1012
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,380
will have to develop

1013
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,820
so I think there's just one last

1014
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,560
question in the that corner and then we

1015
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,680
will wrap up good afternoon uh I have

1016
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,660
sometimes noticed that after

1017
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,440
implementing Sim in a sock the at what

1018
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,740
utmost use of it is not implemented it

1019
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,680
is just used for logging and as a tool

1020
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,320
to provide the data for your

1021
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,960
um the you know whatever the data is

1022
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,839
provided that is just used what would

1023
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,140
your advice be on optimizing uh the use

1024
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,060
of a Sim tool because it is just more

1025
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,799
than collecting the data over there

1026
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,040
so I mean something that we see from our

1027
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,079
customers also right they end up

1028
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,520
implementing same

1029
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,260
and then they come back and ask okay

1030
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,880
what is the use case that I should do

1031
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,060
around this right so I mean I would I

1032
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,740
would suggest that when you are going to

1033
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,359
implement a stock and what you

1034
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,160
understand what you are getting into

1035
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,320
right and why why you are collecting

1036
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,240
various data it's about visibility then

1037
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,520
how do you correlate you should be able

1038
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,339
to come up with the use cases that is uh

1039
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,920
relevant to your business and as as it

1040
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,660
was pointed out in the beginning it

1041
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,680
should be looked from the business

1042
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,859
perspective right security is no more uh

1043
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,319
uh just a thing that Technologies are

1044
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:14,880
talking about it's a boardroom

1045
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,980
discussion so from that point of view

1046
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,319
what is it and how what are the use

1047
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:22,020
cases that uh is relevant to the

1048
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,359
business that has to be decided and

1049
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,640
write data has to be collected and

1050
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,160
correlated that's that's probably the

1051
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,040
problem there where people collect data

1052
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,900
for probably a compliance reason or

1053
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,760
somebody is telling them to do it and

1054
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,260
then they are like okay what should I do

1055
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,180
with it that's that's probably I'll just

1056
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,579
add one point always remember Sim is not

1057
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,980
a Dumping Ground of logs

1058
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,839
okay you need to understand why you are

1059
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,060
implementing Sim make sure that the

1060
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,520
objective of implementing Sim is first

1061
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,160
addressed and then the compliance on the

1062
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,380
audit becomes the byproduct because of

1063
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,119
the implementation

1064
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,119
okay I think that's all for this panel

1065
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,560
discussion I think we are already

1066
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,480
waiting for the next one yeah if you

1067
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,460
have any questions let's sync up offline

1068
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,680
and uh let's say I I hope you had a

1069
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,540
great one thank you thank you very much
