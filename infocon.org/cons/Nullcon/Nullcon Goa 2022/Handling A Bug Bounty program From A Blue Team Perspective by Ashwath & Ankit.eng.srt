so good afternoon my name is ashwath uh

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,340
you know at Razer pay I work on cloud

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,559
and infra security and also helping out

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,620
with appsec uh I also have one kids with

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,799
me

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,140
hey good afternoon

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,340
so uh my name is

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,340
here I mostly look into Security

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,560
operation stuff

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,260
awesome so uh before we do anything

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,360
right uh you know I think today we'll

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
focus a little bit on what exactly is

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,780
bug Bounty like what's the typical

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,120
workflow of a bug Bounty Hunter we start

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
with the story kind of talk about the

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,540
basics of what you know would happen

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
behind bug Bounty and how exactly to

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,079
prevent against it right you know the

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,760
lessons we learned and how did we

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
automate how did we set up the framework

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,860
and so on okay uh so

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,280
we started uh on hacker one about a year

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,559
ago and for nine months we were running

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
in private mode and what happened was

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,420
one of our co-founders Herschel uh he's

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,280
big into security right apparently you

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,380
know during his college times in IIT

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,159
roorkee he was uh in uh he was doing

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,020
Bounty and you know he was helping out

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,540
multiple companies right uh so he's

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,979
always been like every time you go to a

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,720
meeting he's when are you guys going

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,979
public when are you guys going public

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,720
and we had crossed past the deadline a

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,000
few times so it is like May 23rd we said

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
okay fine I think we're ready it was a

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,320
Monday I remember very well uh around 6

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,659
PM we turned the switch in hacker one

39
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,720
from private to public and sandesh who

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,979
is just here in the panel discussion

41
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,320
before uh he said okay guys you know

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,180
this is final we are never turning it

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,460
back to private again I hope all of you

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,960
guys are ready right so we monitor for

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
15 minutes nothing happened so we were

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,740
all like we logged off and you know 6 PM

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,020
we are done for the day right 7 PM what

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,360
happens is five app teams are like so we

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,700
have this incident response which kind

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,520
of takes care of all of the alerts

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,979
outages and everything so five teams

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,659
reach out saying hey we are seeing like

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,220
a lot of error rate you know something's

54
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,060
going on

55
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,219
so then one of us quickly hop on the

56
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,320
call and we quickly identify that okay

57
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,419
this is some somewhere related to you

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,480
know us going live on uh hiker one and

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,000
uh around 10 pm you know the number is

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,620
constantly increasing and we said okay

61
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,900
security team everybody we're a lean

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,879
team so everybody gets on call let's

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,620
figure out what is going on let's

64
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,720
document everything so whatever fixes

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
we'll go repeat the same thing across

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,220
the other apps as well so that's

67
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,720
basically the thought process at that

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,239
time and around 10 pm you know it

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,340
increased to 12 apps and the incident

70
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,739
managers are constantly like hey what's

71
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,300
going on you know just give us an update

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,739
right because we need to go tell other

73
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,720
teams and ask them to be better prepared

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,420
and stuff uh so I we were up the whole

75
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,760
night by the way and you know trying to

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,280
fix this one after another manually and

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
it was very tempting to go turn it back

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
to private but we were like okay you

79
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
know now that we figured out how exactly

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,860
to kind of take care of this let's just

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,840
you know run through this right and

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,120
while we were documenting it we also

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
said okay whatever we do manually and

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,080
that works we'll also start automating

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,940
so that's basically you know that was

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,519
our Funda saying okay you know if three

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,900
of us are able to do it manually

88
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,819
repeatably then let's just go automate

89
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,780
it as well

90
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,519
so by the next morning you know we had

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,819
like 23 app teams reporting alerts

92
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,080
saying hey there's something going on

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
there's something going on right so

94
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,739
basically for them you know they keep

95
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,720
monitoring the number of 200 oks which

96
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,180
is like an okay status and anytime this

97
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,739
tears they start seeing like a lot of

98
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,680
4x6 or 5x error then they're like okay

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,599
my app is broken you know they wake up

100
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,220
everybody in the team and they're like

101
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,140
hey my app is broken so that night we

102
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,360
were not the only the security team was

103
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,980
not the only team that was awake like a

104
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,840
lot of the app teams were also awake and

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,220
they were like okay whenever I opened

106
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,720
the website it's working whenever I test

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,819
the web the thing it's working but why

108
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,680
am I getting this error rate so that was

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
basically you know what was going on in

110
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,319
their head

111
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,959
so we'll come back to the story we'll

112
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,580
tell you what exactly we did what we

113
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,959
automated and everything our kids will

114
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,640
cover it in more detail but just quick

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,799
thing about razor pay right so uh Razer

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,980
pay enables payments for all of

117
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,799
yeah sorry so Razer pay enables payments

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,959
for all companies

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,380
um uh so the idea here is we want to

120
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,600
enable uh we want to take care of the

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,519
finance part in the payment part for all

122
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,779
of the startups so that they can go

123
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,880
focus on their journey and you know

124
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,620
improving their stuff right so if you

125
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,900
look at the number of companies that a

126
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,340
Razer pay helps out you know they're

127
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,560
like a lot of big Brands and we have

128
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,139
over 10 lakh plus Merchants so we are

129
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,180
more in the B2B space so that's the

130
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,800
reason why you might not see like a lot

131
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,780
of advertisements or you know you might

132
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,940
not keep hearing about Razer pay so

133
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,020
often

134
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,020
um and to manage all of this madness

135
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,520
especially you know during covet there

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,400
was a hockey stick growth uh because uh

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,639
of a lot of on push towards online and

138
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,979
stuff right so to manage all of this we

139
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,020
have about six views over 800 engineers

140
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,840
and the tech stack is spread out uh

141
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
we're all in on the cloud uh we are

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
complete AWS shop

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,860
right so this is coming back to uh

144
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,080
hacker one and coming back to you know

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,820
what exactly we did right so we did

146
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,460
choose hacker one as our partner for uh

147
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,500
the bug Bounty program I think there was

148
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,360
a question saying okay uh in the

149
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
previous session why didn't you do it

150
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,880
yourself because we didn't have the

151
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
bandwidth to be honest right so we

152
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,940
wanted to Outsource some part of it and

153
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
hacker one guys knew exactly what to do

154
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,280
uh so the if you look at the bottom

155
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,600
right you know these are the rules and

156
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,340
the regulations so basically in the

157
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,440
rules just you know send us a header

158
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,180
saying you know you're a researcher uh

159
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,220
just add like a hacker one header and in

160
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,840
the email also just put in you know via

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,460
hacker1.com right so we can quickly

162
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,620
identify and say hey it is it does

163
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,419
belong to like a bug Bounty researcher

164
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,340
and it's not attacker traffic and the

165
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,680
final piece is uh we did mention this

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,560
here do not run automated tools but you

167
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,580
know hackers are hackers uh so you know

168
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,919
it does happen so this notification was

169
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,120
very interesting right so May 23 we were

170
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,620
we didn't know what happened like we

171
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,419
were like okay we simply went and turned

172
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,520
the switch to public and how the hell

173
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,080
are we getting so much traffic right so

174
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,600
then we we got we solved a mystery

175
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,919
because there's a Twitter bot that

176
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,539
tracks every program that goes public

177
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,400
and it puts so this is the Twitter

178
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,440
handle right so there's the disclosed H1

179
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,020
which actually goes and says okay here a

180
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,060
program is public and because of which

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,100
you know a lot of research is what they

182
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,860
do is they uh they want to find stuff

183
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,900
easily like the low hanging fruit so

184
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,699
it's just like bombarded teams with

185
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,740
automated tools right

186
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,960
um so yeah this is the typical hiker

187
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,580
mindset where even though we ask them

188
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,039
not to run automated tools uh I

189
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,479
understand you know it's it's good to

190
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,580
kind of you know use automated tools at

191
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,400
some time but just don't like bombard

192
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,139
the whole company with automated tools

193
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,060
right because it does cause a lot of

194
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,259
pain

195
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,020
so looking at the workflow of what a bug

196
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,940
Bounty researcher would do so it's split

197
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,560
into three phases right phase one you

198
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
know if there's Razer pay.com go find

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,539
all of the subdomains possible uh so you

200
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,060
know you can use multiple tools so for

201
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,940
example if there's Razer pay.com find

202
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,620
api.racerbay.com

203
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,360
Social dot recipe so all the possible

204
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,699
sub debates so that is phase one so then

205
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,560
once you have a list of subdomains then

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,720
find all the valid URLs so this is like

207
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
you know slash robots.txt success you

208
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,699
know whatever all of the possible URLs

209
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,039
and once you get a this list you know

210
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,319
then go bombard it with attack payloads

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,880
right so this is basically you know if

212
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,919
you trim it down this is these are

213
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,620
basically like the three phases

214
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,599
so um

215
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,900
folks do scan this hashtag and you know

216
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,180
it will take you to a Twitter page uh

217
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,360
and when you go to the Twitter page uh

218
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,599
do put in your uh favorite tool so we

219
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,520
have suchit here who's our red team of

220
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,720
switches do you want to put your hand up

221
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,319
so if your tool name matches uh his tool

222
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,720
name then you'll get like uh some swag

223
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,419
and uh you know the first few folks to

224
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,919
do it will uh get the swag so here are

225
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,960
the three faces that is phase one is sub

226
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
domain enumeration okay let me go back

227
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,180
to the QR code uh you can you can come a

228
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,259
little ahead and uh

229
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,660
I'll pause here for 30 seconds

230
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,879
so three phases sub domain enumeration

231
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,300
the name of the tool second one is uh to

232
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,460
find the right URLs you know what is the

233
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,620
uh tool that you use and the third one

234
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,060
specifically you know let's just focus

235
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,979
on Burp what is your favorite burp

236
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,520
plugin to get uh the

237
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,399
uh there's the payloads or the

238
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,860
what is your favorite plugin right so

239
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,599
I'll probably wait here for another 30

240
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,839
seconds

241
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,300
all right so that should take you to my

242
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,279
Twitter thread and just reply on that so

243
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,080
okay

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,980
great work

245
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,620
all right moving on uh we'll come back

246
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,839
to this helper I'll I'll show the QR

247
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,519
code in the end as well so coming back

248
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,019
to our setup right just taking a step

249
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,700
back and coming back to our setup so

250
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,459
whenever you hit our endpoint the first

251
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,760
piece it goes to is like an ALB uh uh

252
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
which is an application load balancer

253
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,720
and we also have the web application

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,180
firewall or the warf that stacked to it

255
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,000
and uh then it comes to our own

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
self-hosted API Gateway which is based

257
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
on conch uh so Kong is this API Gateway

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,120
where you can add like your custom

259
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,040
plugins so we have our authentication

260
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,959
authorization rate limiters and a bunch

261
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,700
of plugins that's hosted in the second

262
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,440
piece and then finally comes the micro

263
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,700
service right

264
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,860
so now let's look at what would happen

265
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,080
in the back end whenever you know a

266
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,899
person sitting on one machine uh sends

267
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,220
like a bunch of traffic right so

268
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,779
approximate number of domains you know

269
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,060
let's assume it's 500 and you know

270
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,339
there's a there's a payload list which

271
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,700
is about 10K and uh you know for each of

272
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,459
the valid URLs let's say you send 5K uh

273
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,860
payloads right so the system gets

274
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,899
overwhelmed with 2.5 into 10 to the

275
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,880
power 10. so just process that number

276
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,640
for a second right 2.5 into 10 to the

277
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,160
part 10 just buy the power of one laptop

278
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,200
or whenever you run like a nuclei

279
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,060
template or anything of that sort right

280
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,740
or whenever you run a chain

281
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,320
so these many payloads hit the system so

282
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,820
let's say you know there's a choto moto

283
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,160
micro service which you know just gets

284
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,040
like a few hundred requests per second

285
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,200
what would happen to that service right

286
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,140
you know that that is the big problem so

287
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,180
that's why you know the all the

288
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,740
developers think that my application is

289
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,180
down my application is down but in

290
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,880
reality it's just bug Bounty traffic and

291
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,980
why do the forexx errors happen let's

292
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,500
say you know the URL is not valid or you

293
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,320
know the URL is not the erroring is not

294
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
very done very well that's where you

295
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
know this happens

296
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,019
okay so just looking at the impact on

297
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,459
the micro Services you send all of these

298
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,200
requests let's say the waft blocks a

299
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,540
majority of them but still about 500k

300
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,339
requests uh you know or five lakh

301
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,480
requests will get to the application

302
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
load balancer and you know the

303
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,899
microservice will still get overloaded

304
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,200
with stuff right so this is this is kind

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
of the background so the three pieces

306
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,399
are whenever bug Bounty traffic you'll

307
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,560
get like three phases phase one is on

308
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,660
the subdomain enumeration phase two is

309
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,959
on the uh finding the valid URLs and

310
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,700
phase three is like the attack payloads

311
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,380
right so I'll hand it over to Ankita and

312
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,120
Ankit will do like a deep dive on how

313
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,500
exactly did we handle the incident

314
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,300
whatever what did their own books look

315
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,519
like what automation we put in place and

316
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,339
how to kind of scale it right

317
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,019
thanks Joshua

318
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,820
so as I should mentioned this as The

319
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,180
Story Goes means on 23rd may we were

320
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,540
bombarded with uh such traffic of that

321
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,860
of that number

322
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,779
and at the end of the night perhaps

323
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,180
early in the morning we kind of got a

324
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,399
hint of what it is that we will have to

325
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,260
you know continuously keep on doing

326
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,240
right now if if something like that

327
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
happens again

328
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
but then we also thought that it cannot

329
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,839
be our you know it cannot be a part of

330
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,079
our BAU activity we cannot uh let we run

331
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,779
a very lean security team so what we

332
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,760
have to do is we have to go back to the

333
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,860
drawing board and then perhaps see what

334
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,779
are the things that we can control out

335
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,140
of this scenario so we had this think

336
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,540
clear in our mind that there are three

337
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,940
phases that will happen each time when

338
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,360
an attack or a traffic comes so how we

339
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,940
would now want to understand that

340
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,459
if there are any of these phases on

341
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,740
which we do not have absolutely no

342
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,600
control over and then if there are

343
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,300
anything which we can do to at least

344
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,279
stop or at least identify and things

345
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,440
that are happening in any of the bucket

346
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,540
of the phases so as you can see in phase

347
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,459
one it is mostly subdomain enumeration

348
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,339
we did not have much control over who

349
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,740
does the animation what tool is he using

350
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,320
and it's basically just uh

351
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,420
a website that you need and you can you

352
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,940
can run animation tools on it and

353
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,320
perhaps it's it's it did not uh need us

354
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,540
as organization to do anything on on top

355
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,940
of that so for phase two and phase three

356
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,100
are some things that we thought that yes

357
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,800
we can we can put some of our controls

358
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,959
in these

359
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,180
but before doing that we were very clear

360
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,279
that we have to have some kind of

361
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,440
objectives of before in in the previous

362
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,959
talk also we heard uh the folks say that

363
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,060
before you start doing anything or let's

364
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,860
say even when we start implementing

365
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,200
defense strategies it is very essential

366
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,180
to know that what we are defending what

367
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,880
is our main objective so our primary

368
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,160
concern was that availability needs to

369
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,139
be the key at no point of time we would

370
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,480
want our businesses to go down or our

371
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,160
environment to go down just because it

372
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,200
is a spike in uh let's say bug Bounty

373
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
traffic but at the same time we also had

374
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,700
to tread the path ensuring that we

375
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,639
create good experience for the hunters

376
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,079
because at the end of the day they are

377
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,700
also working for a our benefit whatever

378
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,519
they find out is precisely what we need

379
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,240
from them so we did not want to had to

380
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,980
have a principle that whenever we see

381
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,800
that uh hunter or a researcher is

382
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,839
sending traffic towards us we do not

383
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,000
want them to block it right away so we

384
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,120
wanted to uh to the researchers to have

385
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,220
good enough experience

386
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,680
the third thing and to ensure the above

387
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,800
two perhaps was to ensure that we have

388
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,320
this categorization done in RN which

389
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,779
would give us information about

390
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,760
some kind of inversion about the traffic

391
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,279
that is coming our way so if the traffic

392
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,320
is legitimate or if the traffic is

393
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,199
coming solely from bug Bounty or

394
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:41,880
in other scenarios if the traffic is

395
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,800
suspicious traffic which is let's say

396
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
coming from any other adversarial

397
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,399
malicious intent activities

398
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,279
and then on top of it uh the most

399
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,339
important thing that again uh security

400
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,100
team who runs lean in terms of the

401
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,740
Manpower is that you want to remove

402
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,019
yourself from the processes once the

403
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,240
process is set so once you have done all

404
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,100
the manual work once you've figured out

405
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,260
what you need to do we at some point of

406
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,380
time we also wanted to give the other

407
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,139
team this responsibility to you know to

408
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,180
take this opportunity and run it through

409
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,540
and ensure that there will be minimal

410
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,760
intervention from the security team to

411
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,279
handle these kind of attempts and

412
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,620
which which we can do through

413
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,139
self-served dashboard so we wanted to

414
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,420
have some kind of automations put on

415
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,660
which there will be let's say minimum uh

416
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,060
need of a security researcher to jump in

417
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,579
in terms of uh in cases where there is

418
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,279
Spike in traffic

419
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,500
so just one uh add on one point to add

420
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,120
on right so availability especially for

421
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
razor pay is very very important uh

422
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,100
because if our systems go down then

423
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,440
doesn't only impact us but it impacts

424
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,660
end parties who are dependent right so

425
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,920
for example you know you won't be able

426
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,420
to get your swiggy orders or the right

427
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,860
orders that lives like a lot of people

428
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,680
pissed off uh so that's the reason you

429
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,480
know availability is super super

430
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,100
important for us while we're trying to

431
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,380
you know learn more on security

432
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,480
availability is super important that's

433
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,639
why you know for most companies the same

434
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,500
thing right so while you're doing this

435
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,139
please do also be cognizant that you

436
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,839
know there are people just like you on

437
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,220
the other side who are trying to prevent

438
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,480
all of this

439
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,820
just that one column

440
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,360
so with the guiding principles in mind

441
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,519
we started with categorization of the

442
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,800
traffic so if you see what the general

443
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,019
flow of the traffic is that we have a

444
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,779
code logger we use Sumo Logic for it all

445
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,660
traffic comes to uh this core logging

446
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,639
platform and from there we have built

447
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,339
our threat Intel Tools in combination

448
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,500
with AWS buff and then some signatures

449
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,019
that we have created internally they

450
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,940
help us to filter out the suspicious

451
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,300
traffic that comes uh in mixed with all

452
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,279
the traffic that is incoming

453
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,320
once we remove or filter out this

454
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,360
suspicious traffic we are left with uh

455
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,880
the Bounty traffic and on that Bounty

456
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,819
traffic also we kind of uh distributed

457
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,859
that traffic into two buckets one is

458
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,500
good uh Bounty and then another is bad

459
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,619
Bounty traffic by which I mean that

460
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,540
ashrad mentioned a few sites ago that we

461
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,520
created some rules and guidelines that

462
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,260
we wanted the hunters to follow when

463
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,939
they are uh testing against our

464
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,079
organization

465
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,199
so for in any traffic in which we find

466
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,199
those identifiers we label them as good

467
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,780
bug Bounty traffic and in those

468
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,000
scenarios where we do not find any

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,400
identifier and the only option left with

470
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,160
us to identify that as Bounty traffic is

471
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,380
to understand the payload pattern and

472
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,120
then perhaps come up with a signature

473
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,880
fingerprint we call them as uh bad bug

474
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,539
Bounty traffic

475
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,059
now very brief uh definition about blue

476
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,860
team I hope I know there are a lot of

477
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,960
red teamers here and Pen testers so the

478
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
blue team is kind of uh an opposite to

479
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
what a red team does so nist defines us

480
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,580
that it is a group of researchers who

481
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,280
have the responsibility to ensure that

482
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,740
the system of any organization is up and

483
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,740
running and it does that through three

484
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,600
major phases

485
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,080
speaking in context of of our bug Bounty

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,900
issue the first phase for a blue uh or

487
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,720
for a blue teamer is to to detect means

488
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,120
first of all we have to create some use

489
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,340
cases and alert which gets triggered

490
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,620
whenever something you know something

491
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,900
fails or whenever whenever a count

492
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,460
increases

493
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,740
once we have that once we have that

494
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,320
detection we would want to

495
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,500
uh remediate it and then before

496
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,720
remediating we need to in them again

497
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,419
talking in terms of bug bounty we would

498
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,220
want to first of all fingerprint it

499
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,919
means if we have understood that the

500
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,799
traffic is coming from a bug Bounty uh

501
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,559
researcher we would want to uh have some

502
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,960
kind of information that defines that

503
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,660
researcher in a way that we can take or

504
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,700
we can at least decide that we want to

505
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,299
take any action against it or not so in

506
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,460
terms of fingerprinting we identify the

507
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,740
traffic we identify the IP signatures we

508
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,780
identify the payload pattern and then

509
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,480
once we have done this it all boils down

510
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,179
to answer the question that do we want

511
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,980
to take an action against this

512
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,140
particular traffic or not and if yes

513
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,299
then what kind of action do we want to

514
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,340
take so that comes under the remediation

515
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,240
phase of a blue diamond

516
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,760
so again talking about the identify

517
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
phase and remediate phase what we did as

518
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,840
I mentioned we divided we had divided

519
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,000
the Bounty traffic into two parts so we

520
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,740
also divided the hunters into two part

521
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,860
we're seeing we uh defined the first

522
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,860
part of the hunters as compliant Bounty

523
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,980
Hunters by which we meant that all those

524
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,679
Hunters were sending us traffic which

525
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,660
had information which had some kind of

526
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,760
identifier information let's say they

527
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,160
had customer custom headers they are

528
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,100
using uh connect in email information if

529
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,500
we find any of the identifier we say

530
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,780
that it is the compliant Bounty Hunter

531
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,820
or else if they do not have any kind of

532
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,980
identify we say it is a Divergent uh

533
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,440
Bounty Hunter so

534
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,500
at the end of this identity phase what

535
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,720
one needs to understand is you need you

536
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
can answer this particular question that

537
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,160
whether the traffic is whether the

538
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,299
traffic which is coming in your

539
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,100
environment is it above quantity traffic

540
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,500
if yes then what kind of boundary

541
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,640
traffic it is so that concludes uh phase

542
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,160
identity now so I identify phase in

543
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,100
remediate Phase what we and what we

544
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,840
understood is that remediation has to

545
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,500
happen at the off layer so for compliant

546
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,020
bounty hunters as I mentioned in my

547
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,820
guiding principles as well

548
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,299
we did not want the compliant Hunters to

549
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,100
have a bad experience you know

550
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,320
researching our environment so for that

551
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,419
we ensure that we do not take any action

552
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,580
against them but at the same time it was

553
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,919
very very necessary to have an internal

554
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,020
communication spread out I mean amongst

555
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,120
our team in outside the security team

556
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,940
saying that look there are some uh

557
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,980
requests that come in your way and that

558
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,380
you'll not find that it is not a logical

559
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,600
uh request but at the same time the

560
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,700
intent of that request is not malicious

561
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,980
so we'll not be doing anything against

562
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,039
that and for the Divergent bounty

563
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,220
hunters what we decided is on a case to

564
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,840
case basis we will see whether we want

565
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
to throttle the uh the traffic that is

566
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,679
coming our way or or else we will have

567
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,700
to block the traffic itself

568
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,299
foreign

569
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,520
s right so

570
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,460
um while we did the May 23rd attack it

571
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,080
was very simple the first phase which is

572
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,059
alerting alerting was already in place

573
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,100
where the app teams were getting alerts

574
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,600
whenever the error rate goes beyond a

575
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,460
certain point then the phase two was

576
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,500
identification so this is where you know

577
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,200
most of our Intel and most of uh you

578
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,600
know our IP was and then the phase three

579
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,220
remediate you know basically we have two

580
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,140
weapons one is you can throttle the

581
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,580
traffic where you can that is you can

582
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,380
slow down the traffic that comes from a

583
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,780
given uh person or you can basically

584
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,039
block you know if they still don't

585
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,299
listen just go ahead and block right

586
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,520
block is like the last last thing that

587
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,559
we want to do and you know as a

588
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,419
principal uh we don't want to block

589
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,400
payments for anybody right so that's the

590
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,740
reason we really don't want to go ahead

591
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,679
and use the block mode uh but throttle

592
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,200
is something that you know we uh kind of

593
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,960
rely on yeah yeah foreign

594
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,020
so now now that we know that what we

595
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,400
have to do manually in terms of

596
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,740
identification we have to now automate

597
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,200
it so how do we automate this thing so

598
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
the first important thing is to create

599
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,299
decision flows for every scenario so so

600
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,760
let's say for scenario a when that

601
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,320
happens what are the things or what are

602
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,140
the steps that that we we are thinking

603
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,200
to take and we wanted to document each

604
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,059
and everything because that decision

605
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,580
tree flows to create run books for

606
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,480
ourselves

607
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
those run books help other team members

608
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,280
also to just look into the situation

609
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,720
that has happened look into the decision

610
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,659
flow and then immediately know that what

611
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,220
are the what are the remediation

612
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,559
measures that they want or the security

613
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,360
team should should be doing or let's say

614
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,100
the app team should be doing in those

615
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,380
scenario in those cases and at the end

616
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,360
of the day we wanted to come up with

617
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,539
some kind of self-serve dashboard

618
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,940
on which if anybody looks into that

619
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,580
dashboard he or she gets an idea that

620
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,980
whether the traffic is identified

621
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,020
correctly and if it is then what is the

622
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,059
action that is planned to be taken on it

623
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,020
okay

624
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,120
so in our particular scenario what we

625
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,520
did is we used Sumo logic as our tool

626
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,700
again and then uh if you see we had this

627
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,039
upper graph already present this is the

628
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,220
graph which comes for all micro servers

629
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,520
Services error traffic it gives you a

630
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,440
view of all the error traffic that comes

631
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,780
from the micro Services we built a very

632
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,840
similar graph on top on on on this

633
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,780
particular Trend saying that this is the

634
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,900
patent recognition that we have found

635
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,659
which is given when an H1 traffic shows

636
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,299
or a hack oven traffic shows an outlier

637
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,299
So for anybody who is looking these two

638
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,100
graphs in conjunction the only thing

639
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,980
that they now have to see is whether

640
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,860
they find any similarity between the

641
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,419
spikes that they give that they are

642
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,340
seeing let's say for in the first panel

643
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,740
the spike that comes for micro service

644
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,140
error is it similar to the spike which

645
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,600
is coming which is from the H1 traffic

646
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,200
error so if the spike is from H1 and

647
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,720
there is a similar comparable traffic

648
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,059
spike in the overall micro Services it

649
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,340
means that the the spike that has been

650
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,500
caused in the micro Services is

651
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,200
primarily because of the the bug Bounty

652
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,380
traffic

653
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,380
now that we have identified what we used

654
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,980
to do is let's say a bug a blue teamer

655
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,100
identify this profiles it takes all the

656
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,500
fingerprinting information that that he

657
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,640
needs to take

658
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,740
but then still there was a decision

659
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,840
pending that do we want to throttle it

660
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,940
or do we want to block it even when we

661
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,919
have taken this information there was

662
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,780
still a need to go to our devops team

663
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,059
and then ask them to do the particular

664
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,380
thing that we want so let's say if you

665
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,159
want to block the traffic we had a block

666
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,039
list at which the devops team had to

667
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,260
update it so that that particular IP

668
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,640
gets blocked and the similar thing was

669
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,980
to be done for throttle but obviously it

670
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,380
was not a scalable solution we we did

671
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,140
not want to have that kind of dependency

672
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,299
each time we have to take a decision so

673
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,600
we did not want to include devops in all

674
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,659
our cycles of of taking actions so how

675
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,820
did we how do we automate it was the

676
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,720
question

677
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,179
so again we came up with a very simple

678
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,260
framework

679
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,659
the primary objective of this framework

680
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,419
was to enable the blue teamer to be able

681
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,580
to do everything right out of the

682
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,500
console or of right out of the Sumo

683
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,559
logic console itself so what our process

684
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,559
now does is that it it picks the

685
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,419
important queries it Aggregates the

686
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,880
fingerprint and it then pushes it to an

687
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,320
S3 bucket

688
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,419
back pushing is done through a schedule

689
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,120
forwarder this is a feature that you get

690
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,520
uh from sumo logic it's very similar to

691
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,880
anything that that logger will any of

692
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
the loggers gives us this feature that

693
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,720
you aggregate whatever information that

694
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,340
you need to Aggregate and then you just

695
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,039
forward it to uh to a bucket once we

696
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,900
have those aggregated information in the

697
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,360
bucket we we wrote another Cron job

698
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,659
which would push those aggregation to

699
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,360
the off list and then the wolf list gets

700
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
automatically updated so here we removed

701
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,340
that dependency from devops and that and

702
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,700
then we ensure that each time the shed

703
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,679
the schedule search is running at Sumo

704
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,679
the vaf list or the throttle list and as

705
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,360
well as the block list gets updated

706
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,840
so this is the final Confluence or the

707
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,640
final uh dashboard that we created

708
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,860
the the main idea which drives this

709
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,200
dashboard is

710
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,360
irrespective of who is looking into on

711
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,340
this dashboard we you will be able to

712
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,460
understand or give answers to three

713
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,460
questions first of all is whether the

714
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,520
traffic coming in our environment is is

715
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,919
the traffic a bug Bounty traffic if it

716
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,679
is a bug Bounty traffic is the bug

717
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,779
Bounty traffic a good uh bug Bounty

718
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,640
traffic or a bad bug Bounty traffic and

719
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
if it is a bad bug Bounty traffic what

720
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,200
is the kind of action we are wanting to

721
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,179
take is it that we want to throttle it

722
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,340
or we want to block it

723
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,340
so having had this Confluence we also

724
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,299
you know means there was it it uh

725
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,520
creating everything everything is is

726
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,220
kind of a continual learning process it

727
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,340
did not happen once I mean overnight the

728
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,919
the queries needed to be matured and so

729
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,080
there were there were some lessons that

730
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,520
we learned along the way and then we

731
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,500
kept on feeding it back to our original

732
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,419
query and making it better and better so

733
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,400
we'll talk more about the Lessons

734
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,559
Learned as well as some key takeaways

735
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,539
from the whole activity sure thank you

736
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,100
thank you Ankit so just going back to

737
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,360
the previous slide right so basically

738
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,360
this is the money shot uh so the reason

739
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,100
why this is the money shot is it will

740
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,480
give you all the information in one

741
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,400
place so the two things that you want

742
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,440
answers for right so once you see an

743
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,120
error rate a developer would want to say

744
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,640
okay is this uh hacker one is this bug

745
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,500
Bounty traffic or no right so that's the

746
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,700
first question that they want to answer

747
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,500
if that's the first question that the

748
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,120
answer and the answer is yes then the

749
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,500
second question is is it a good bug

750
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,659
bounty hunter or a bad bug Bounty Hunter

751
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,460
should I do something about it or no

752
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,960
right so those are basically like the

753
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,520
two questions and it'll give you clear

754
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,140
answers to both those questions because

755
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,179
you know if you look at the bottom the

756
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,400
panel 4 right the bottom right graph

757
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,960
that will tell you where the spikes are

758
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,279
so they can superimpose with the

759
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
previous graph and they can take a

760
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,059
decision so then the the top graph will

761
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,100
tell you like the list of ips that are

762
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,779
sending like a lot of traffic right so

763
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,179
it's basically a self-serve and the

764
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,799
security team doesn't get into the loop

765
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,480
unless you know there's something new

766
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,700
that's come up or you know if they want

767
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,740
us to take immediate action right so we

768
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,659
basically got ourselves out of the loop

769
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,120
uh my mentor a long time ago gave me

770
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,919
like a brilliant piece of advice the

771
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,240
advice was always try to replace

772
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,640
yourself so that you can move on and do

773
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,500
something else right so that's basically

774
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,919
you know what we try to do here was make

775
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,500
as much self-serve as possible so the

776
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,000
incident response and the developers

777
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,820
could go around with it uh so the next

778
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,220
piece is you know just the lessons uh

779
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,779
that we learned so continuous feedback

780
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,820
like Ankit mentioned uh continuous

781
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,140
feedback is important because the

782
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,059
payloads keep changing so you'll have to

783
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,919
upload your payloads on the list where

784
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,899
you identify whether a traffic is good

785
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,000
or bad or if it's from bug Bounty or no

786
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,240
and also the methods keep changing so we

787
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,520
keep on top of it and the one thing that

788
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,880
we learned was you know most tools do

789
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,740
promise that we are very good out of the

790
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,320
box but trust me no tool will kind of

791
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,059
block all of the traffic bug Bounty

792
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,799
traffic right out of the box right so

793
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,720
you need to fine tune the tool or you

794
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,860
need to kind of understand your

795
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,899
environment and tailor fit it to your

796
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,000
environment specifically ours was super

797
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,220
super complex b2c is a little more easy

798
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,919
but B2B is very very complex because we

799
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,419
have kirana Merchants then there is

800
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,720
swigia then there is dream11 right so we

801
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,399
need to treat each of those

802
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,440
Merchants differently right because

803
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,779
kirana will probably give us like maybe

804
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,820
you know 10 lakh Rupees business whereas

805
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,980
dream 11 and swiggy are so huge right so

806
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,559
yeah that that that's where you know

807
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,380
things get a little tricky and uh try to

808
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,820
block things at the outermost layer

809
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,080
which is the worst so that it doesn't

810
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,020
come into your environment and uh try to

811
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,600
kind of learn from the researchers also

812
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,820
basically the researchers are targeting

813
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,340
your environment so you know try to

814
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,380
learn things there as well so the key

815
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,880
takeaways right first is know your

816
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,500
environment know your environment really

817
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,779
well uh because know where what is

818
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,880
getting logged and the headers that I

819
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,620
was talking about right so most of the

820
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,120
places the one thing that we realized

821
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,919
that the headers were not getting logged

822
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,899
though the researchers were sending the

823
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,880
headers the our logging was not logging

824
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,679
that particular header so that is also

825
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,140
very very important and the second piece

826
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,360
is around thinking like an attacker

827
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,460
right so once you build all of these

828
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,399
systems in place we need to also kind of

829
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,120
fine tune the engine to make sure that

830
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,620
you know the system is working as

831
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,840
expected and then the final piece is

832
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,460
focus on the self-serve and the

833
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,179
automation piece okay uh I think uh that

834
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,360
is it uh any questions uh you know we're

835
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,179
around if you want to have uh

836
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,500
so

837
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
um

838
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,779
you know what was the decision behind uh

839
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,700
you know having this bug Bounty program

840
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,799
on the live environment and not using a

841
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,179
staging environment correct I have very

842
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,460
limited experience on this but still uh

843
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,539
what was the decision management

844
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,299
decision uh behind making the actual

845
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,700
website or the platform live instead of

846
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,020
having a different platform for this

847
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,440
correct so two questions right uh why

848
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,539
one is why staging versus why production

849
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,700
and two was what was the thought process

850
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,740
behind going after it in production so

851
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,080
hackers don't go after staging right so

852
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,120
staging is uh you know you're basically

853
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,340
kind of avoiding risk or reward trying

854
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,360
to limit risk uh so uh again it was a

855
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,860
long process we learned along the way

856
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,080
like don't start by going public you

857
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,460
know you'll definitely burn your hands

858
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,799
and somebody will get fired right at the

859
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,419
end of the day because system will go

860
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:40,580
down for sure

861
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,520
so start small start with private then

862
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,620
start with private plus uat start with

863
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,960
private plus broad then go public public

864
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,179
is Big Bang okay next

865
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,159
I can take your question quickly okay hi

866
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,740
Shiva here uh so my question is bit

867
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,559
different uh so I want to understand

868
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
um did you follow any guidelines to

869
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
select the bug Bounty platform you

870
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,679
selected hacker one but is there any

871
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,799
framework or guidelines you followed uh

872
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,260
to select the right we're going to

873
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,140
platform friend a good good question uh

874
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,179
so uh

875
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,880
I think you know we we are going to

876
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,860
write a blog post on how we did vendor

877
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,659
selection process not just for bug

878
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,279
Bounty but for other things as well

879
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,779
because I think it will definitely help

880
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,659
out others as well uh but the reason why

881
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,120
we went with hacker one was I think it

882
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,460
was easy to talk to them that uh

883
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,559
engagement process and also the

884
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,659
researchers were really happy like we

885
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:43,980
didn't want to go with a platform where

886
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,659
the researchers were not very happy with

887
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,580
the platform right so essentially you

888
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,919
know if you if you flip the coin around

889
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,899
the researchers are happy that's when

890
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,399
you know you get good bugs the

891
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,980
researchers are not happy you know they

892
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,720
won't get good works okay next question

893
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,000
so apart from basically bug Bounty

894
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,799
Hunter did you try boards or scanners

895
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,600
like the same approach for bot or

896
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,000
scanners so we do have scanners running

897
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,300
uh in our system but automated tools is

898
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,320
uh

899
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,418
doesn't give you like the high quality

900
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,280
or the high severity findings like the

901
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,379
automated tools are just like medium and

902
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,699
lower most of the time

903
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,800
so uh I have two questions one is that

904
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,239
you mentioned about it's a journey right

905
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,179
correct and we can't just go public so

906
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,760
and you're from reservation correctly so

907
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,040
from Razor pay perspective because a lot

908
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,260
of stake once you go to public uh so how

909
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,139
much is the general time what took you

910
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,239
to match you to this level second thing

911
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,460
is that uh you know what is the match

912
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,320
today because it's not only maturity of

913
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,960
identifying it as soon as you identify

914
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,599
yourself

915
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,859
and not only remediation it's a quick

916
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,300
remediation right and you should be

917
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,599
prepared for for that quick remediation

918
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,400
uh that is second and third thing is

919
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
sorry asking too many questions but when

920
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,720
you talk about hacker when saying that

921
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,760
researchers are happy and all so while

922
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,859
choosing it that is it that you engage

923
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,900
with them uh initially for a couple of

924
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,180
years and then with your experience you

925
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,180
did that or it was a general on uh maybe

926
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,520
a couple of times you work with them or

927
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,280
the kind of uh General discussion about

928
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,800
on their cell stage what they do or who

929
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,619
all are associated

930
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,820
I think let me answer your first two

931
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,800
questions so the first question I did

932
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,240
talk about it during the start of my

933
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,500
talk I don't know if you are not there

934
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,900
but uh so the part two to the question

935
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,079
is uh I think we we took about 10 months

936
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,359
to make sure to get to that place but I

937
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:44,760
would say just take time and make sure

938
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,980
your processes are matured and we have a

939
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,380
very good testing our own dog food uh

940
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,420
right suchit who's one of our teamers

941
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,220
you know we made sure that he runs the

942
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,540
pipeline over and over again through

943
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,700
different types and we're able to manage

944
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,960
that traffic that's when you know we

945
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
made the conscious decision to go public

946
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,800
it's not like you can just go if you do

947
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,079
that then you're basically done right so

948
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,040
yeah

949
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,859
yeah I think this side of the okay yeah

950
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:12,119
hi uh this is so already I got I had

951
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,400
three questions two I already uh you

952
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,920
already answered one is the uh the only

953
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,680
one is you were quite talk I mean you're

954
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,140
talking about a lot about engine and and

955
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,599
all of that right which you all you have

956
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,240
developed uh just want to know what sort

957
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,579
of things you have added to stay ahead

958
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,099
of hackers because every day uh new

959
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,260
payloads and everything is generated and

960
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,480
nothing uh the lot of thing things are

961
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,260
not public and uh and yeah and uh

962
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,480
another question is a lot of custom

963
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,119
tools are being created I use lot of

964
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,119
custom tools which uh which ease up my

965
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,599
work but it it's it's automated but also

966
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,180
on the other side it it is mimicking

967
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,060
what uh what I used to do manually so

968
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,520
how you differentiate between those sort

969
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,040
of traffic and because I can also send

970
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,579
you a lot of custom headers just uh why

971
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,560
am I bought or anything like that so how

972
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,280
you distinguish into the Okay so

973
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,740
taking your first part as we were

974
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,380
mentioning means the whole process is

975
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,560
not a One-Shot thing we need to keep on

976
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,440
maturing it so even in terms of payloads

977
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,839
as you were mentioning it obviously it

978
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,560
changes and the first set of the payload

979
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,660
that we use to create our outlier

980
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,359
detection pattern also it's not that it

981
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,180
is a then we did not stick with a static

982
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,060
payload set so to so as to say we also

983
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,220
have our own uh red teaming or pen

984
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,560
testing teams who then again they use

985
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,480
their own custom payloads and they also

986
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,540
keep an eye off on new kind of payload

987
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,780
uh sets that are there in the market and

988
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,119
that are getting used a lot and then we

989
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,700
try and keep up with those kind of Intel

990
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,700
as well and every kind of try and uh

991
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,520
have a maturity cycle for for our

992
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,280
outlier detection pattern as well in the

993
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,020
in the same line even when you say that

994
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,079
let's say you also can create custom

995
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,859
bots which will run at so yes and that

996
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,740
is that is one of scenario where let's

997
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,780
say your payload will will be

998
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,359
particularly different from what we have

999
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,000
set and what we have done uh but if you

1000
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,359
scale it up if a lot of people are again

1001
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,839
using similar Tech technique to you know

1002
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,960
customize that as well but there's this

1003
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
this is not only the payload which will

1004
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,880
give your fingerprint or let's say for

1005
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,500
that matter any of the researchers

1006
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,020
fingerprint reload is a factor that

1007
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,180
comes into play when we are creating

1008
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,280
that outlier detection but it is just

1009
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,800
not the only thing it is it is still a

1010
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,140
there is there's a lot of information in

1011
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,260
that request itself and on which uh

1012
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,359
let's say URL or domain you're attacking

1013
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,119
that also tags along when you create the

1014
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,820
whole outlier detection so if you group

1015
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,940
or categorize everything together you

1016
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,740
will still find a pattern on which you

1017
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,099
can train train your model

1018
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,099
okay

1019
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,520
no so

1020
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,859
the engine that we use Sumo logic right

1021
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,160
it has a built-in ml module which we use

1022
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,560
to run so it's not that we are writing

1023
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,200
our ml code itself but more or less we

1024
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,800
are taking help of the already written

1025
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,820
MLPs that Sumo offers

1026
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,260
so thank you very much and short answer

1027
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,760
to your question we have our own red

1028
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,920
team where we eat our own dog food so I

1029
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,740
think that's how we learn uh right so

1030
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,900
there's no right or wrong answer and you

1031
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,480
know we're probably 98 there so yeah

1032
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,980
that's the short answer

1033
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,480
okay all right thank you thank you very

1034
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,070
much everyone

1035
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,449
