1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,300
start my name is Alex or Whoopi i'm
going to talk about how to lose a runner

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:37,980
the whole bunch of us finally it is
similar us tomorrow hope but basically

3
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:50,129
for iOS so when I already member working
accent is a small enterprise ela and

4
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:59,640
stop and that's when I or and managing
and organizing their done personal

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,319
security for your think so

6
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:16,470
my my main goal here is for four people
that once tool to learn how to use of

7
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:25,530
that I'm just to see a real example hold
uz and as well how to grade + r2 place

8
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:39,990
to I expression it specifically a nice
us application so that's their tips and

9
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,789
first of all we are going to talk about
the binders for work in us that it's

10
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:54,720
michael michael finally out that
specifically just my computer and then

11
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:03,658
it's just a matter it's pretty neat
organized I using as close as is called

12
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,929
a lot of Commons i'm not going to the
smaller structure just identified in

13
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,240
which section in the binary you are

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:21,730
and then a whole binary is organizing
segments and each segment can have one

15
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:30,549
or more sections so we can have one
Michael we can have different Michaels

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:39,340
in one and binary is as a gold-backed my
goal fire but my book and have different

17
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:47,770
Michael files inside the same binary i'm
defining and everybody else upset you

18
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:55,240
have I feel justified the number of
Michael files that you have inside that

19
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:03,220
Michael and then you have a fact our
instructor for each my confinement to

20
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,580
last and inside different arts
instructor as you can see you have a

21
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,600
feeling it's called offset and width
that upset you know where is your mikael

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:26,019
heide but you need two extra analyze
whatever mainly we are going to use that

23
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,860
going brother but it's called yes that
is the brain or to define structures

24
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:44,740
inside Bella I then this is despite easy
it's just a flight instructor instructor

25
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:54,490
that it's really just just right here .
and the name of instructor haha at and

26
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:02,800
the address were a straighter actually
but maybe we can we want to bring a

27
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,370
straighter than little house and we we
have to find that structure we can you

28
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,990
find the spectre de yes Colin and just
writing

29
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:21,700
yeah and his face the neighbors doctor
equal and that is the former of this

30
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,610
factor in that gate we are defining an
extractor that fast

31
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,550
1x taleo four bytes four bytes for
rights and one is strange that it's

32
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:41,389
don't terminate it and it's fine i get
filled sorry we can define the names in

33
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:47,240
the innocent go on and the structure
after define it we can use it inside

34
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,669
their possession but I we can see
different examples here for example how

35
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:04,698
to bring the fuck either or in fact our
theaters that we will I hear the only

36
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,199
thing that we have to take it like out
is that different story isn't big india

37
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,770
so we have to change their tennis in the
session so we will change the

38
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,000
configuration here the reading and then
here I'm defining an instructor for free

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,990
just the but Michael heater that without
two values an x-value an integral value

40
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,580
of $OPERAND is a magic value and the
number of Michael signs that with such

41
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,190
insight and then just apply at the rear
of the part we can see the magic value

42
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:47,479
and that time pass to Michael sighs
insect there that are Michael and then

43
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:54,589
just pray thee before Michael Lichter
structured for the first binary just

44
00:05:54,589 --> 00:06:05,960
defined here and then maybe in the a to
offset its 0 x0 plus the signs off on my

45
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:15,770
computer that Winston people that the
same for Michael heater I here we will

46
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,460
need to define their and historical
record is already fine i'm just writing

47
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:30,770
that dominates enough and if we want to
bring that segment as well with that we

48
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,919
are ready to find there just like that
here we have the all-too-common output

49
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,200
that it's very commonly new

50
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,909
I to extract information from iOS
Henry's and how we can doing the same

51
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,170
with with LA so it's crazy

52
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:58,460
ah so interesting section when you
analyze an application in on us so

53
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,780
interesting sections in the memory that
you maybe I need to get to see we have

54
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:13,549
their segments X and inside that same
eight you have different sections first

55
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,250
of all their section text where you have
the gold or the strength of the winery

56
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:28,310
or that two very specific for iOS
wineries I that class information for

57
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,580
the objective-c classes and methods that
I the battery is using and how to

58
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:42,349
extract information reasonably easy
using very common or even with a rental

59
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:49,040
ministry and the runway and you have a
little like that where you have classes

60
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:56,420
leaves extract from that section or
methods accept section and you have

61
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:04,070
already information from the battery but
in a way with a problem and the problem

62
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:14,780
is that varies a lot from appstore are
encrypted so that's the problem we are

63
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:22,609
going to overcome play that help to
analyze a binary the Lord from app store

64
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:30,470
to see your sections that we have seen
before and analyze it and how to

65
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,870
overcome forward in creation and what
happened with in the library is

66
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:44,179
encrypted that employees tripe soup and
ice for example or try to compile the

67
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:52,609
winery we can see some weird commons
that hardly makes sense

68
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:02,510
just if we tried to extract their
strings just as well as well and it will

69
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:10,610
extract the class names around says that
is included so what does have to look we

70
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,690
have to recreate the binary and we need
to know where the binary is encrypted so

71
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,870
to know where is encrypted or to know if
the minor is encrypted we have to see a

72
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,850
section and what comment section and
it's called else important info or else

73
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:38,990
in hampton inn 464 memories before beat
and as you can see i applying the same

74
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:45,890
BS common you can see section D minor
equipped it I the side of the winery or

75
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:54,199
the defensive lineman its grip else it
were the friction finally starts and

76
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:02,510
just want to find that going ok so what
is the solution the solution is a

77
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,149
diviner is encrypted but has to be the
grip to execute and is exactly the

78
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:14,060
memory so the binary is a collective
memory so the solution is just gold to

79
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,689
the memory go to the section where the
rates increase it and upbeat and we are

80
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,190
going to see how to do that so there had
to do that thing and it's going to

81
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:38,660
plunge but that'll has some problems but
can negate some days so it's not you are

82
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,199
not be able to create some memories ah
degree everything so if you have Michael

83
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:50,870
with different is the great all the
language even if you only want to preach

84
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:58,279
one and if you want to pick something or
just to manipulate something it's a

85
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,770
brown with a lot already so it's not
able to

86
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:10,550
just we have an alternative we can do
that i'll try to let wait product and we

87
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,219
are going to see what happens

88
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,579
so first of all we need product inside
your iphone so you can put there are

89
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:27,258
those in Syria the Syrian rebel but I
didn't have the broad and that maybe

90
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:34,819
it's not so you are not using the last
and persons so the best thing to look

91
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,349
from cheat it's crazy

92
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:48,199
yes I blow the money execute these flash
and I Syria and it's going to be compile

93
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:57,229
it's going to create file just instantly
inside your iphone and then diversion

94
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,790
from three

95
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:05,300
so you're pretty sure that you are using
the reservation but well I think it's

96
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:12,829
already did so in Syria it's as well
they are listed way so just to check

97
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:20,809
that raspberries working inside your
iphone first of all executed with red is

98
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,740
going on

99
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,069
it's working you can bring the family
but you need to the cute alert in the

100
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:35,300
yearbook so executive a common for
example rating then the morning maps

101
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:42,439
with that the uncommon and its working a
wraparound us one but maybe it's not so

102
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:52,969
what could be happening in iOS maybe you
need to apply and indictments in your

103
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,649
route binary and you need to apply that
XML using the hell it common and every

104
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:10,279
common as I minnows as an uppercase and
using it with that XML applying it in

105
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,709
the way rather binary and just to check
in

106
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:24,459
you did well you can do it without one
and just execute over rather not come on

107
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:31,599
and if you are seeing that XML is that
is it assigned within 10 minutes story

108
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,829
so it's working so now we're going to
see all this dead

109
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,829
we have to go to the create a binary in
the US

110
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,000
first of all this project if you are
working with that Michael or my fault .

111
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,500
you are working with Michael maybe you
have to extract Michael you are going to

112
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:04,209
quit then identify if you have a large
enable in in the winery means that the

113
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:11,050
winner is comply with $TIME p.m. and
then just take the information for the

114
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:21,699
description and what we are going to see
all the steps in the mouth so first of

115
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:29,829
all we're going to place but Michael
file from and Michael we can do it in

116
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:39,939
the ways that just using run into those
X and you're going to have to find more

117
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:48,670
that each fire Michael pipe or you can
do it for your own just I as we can see

118
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:56,649
you have to read that Michael heater so
if you don't you remember if i was

119
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,339
interesting because you have so it just
changes in indecision

120
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,470
ah here we are really either we have the
binaries so we're interested just in

121
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,430
different one

122
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:17,050
ok so just breaking the offset with that
comment what that means it means just

123
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:27,339
wait four bytes at that address that is
there the size of that structure

124
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:39,340
it's a that evaluates 8-byte class 8
you're going to hear 48 so we have to

125
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:48,640
bring that section and then I if you
bring if you want to bring all the

126
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:57,340
values you can force it like that and
with up there they're not set we have in

127
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:05,650
size so it just moved they pointed to
the beginning of the fire and just write

128
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:13,689
to that files outside and then you're
going to go after that Michael provide

129
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:23,980
in your faces but it second part you
last two great they might go home and

130
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:31,600
then I you have to identify its being
enable so is the binder is combined with

131
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,870
program independent execution

132
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,260
I you can do it just checking

133
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:47,230
ah Daisy be a battle is a string that is
that brother is using with a comment

134
00:16:47,230 --> 00:17:01,839
with a that namespace and that and we
value the value is that's value so you

135
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:09,760
have I able to handle it with a baby or
with its common as well as you can see

136
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,329
here

137
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:18,459
ah then just take the offset and the
size and first apology binary it's

138
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:24,100
already printed or not so we are going
to see the LC and Gretchen in 4 section

139
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:35,110
or less common houghton always we are in
that what going just check as valiantly

140
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,370
the command field and he eats value it
means that it's

141
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:52,399
that structure so it's 64b is the value
is a structure that is 432 it I with the

142
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,860
BF we got an extra pair of sensor size
on with a baby organic striker book as

143
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:12,320
well the difference between one of them
is the same just as whole you're loading

144
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,629
binary and without if you're lying
wearing that uniform or just without

145
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:26,540
flaps or we / and and just watering
their their minor E is that more than

146
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,370
with the senior information

147
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:36,770
yeah so now we have all the information
that we eat so I we are going to dump

148
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:42,950
the depression the equation part from
the memories so ah

149
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,429
first of all we need to know what the
winery is loads so there is address of

150
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:59,360
the binary is easy able is just slowly
to manually with the book both windows

151
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,229
d and just printing their memory lapse

152
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:10,370
I if we are going to see just just
looking for the section with great

153
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:19,939
education permissions . and here without
there is one or is known by media

154
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:30,950
there's load their takes segment and in
the field at $TIME p.m. hours and that

155
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,650
means that the binary always is going to
be executed in that memory address

156
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:45,590
yep so now we have the information we
know where my name is going to be secure

157
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,720
so we're going to thumb print up a
crystal back here

158
00:19:52,550 --> 00:20:03,919
from memory that I just see a salary
plus very upset and them but sides so

159
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,500
easy is not logical

160
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:15,560
ah and then so we have very quickly part
not the right way in five days so we are

161
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:24,500
going to match define into a defense
system so here the difference is that

162
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:31,580
with we need to check if we are working
with admirable or Michael if we are

163
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:38,659
working with and Michael we too low
where is the very upset but we are going

164
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:49,460
to but different won the Second World
whatever and just see in a part of the

165
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:58,790
binary we need to not just very offset
incentive to different Michael and then

166
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:06,950
plus the grid offset inside the
microfiber and just write the part that

167
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:14,780
clear already equipped and finally the
best part

168
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:24,110
okay without the binary equipped it but
we need to modify one beat just to say

169
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,830
that the battery is the British was not
inserted distal it will we want to get

170
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:41,899
the battery in our knife so we need to
modify just that the retaining and just

171
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:55,790
really ah they'll see encryption in for
a lot common lady in in that offset + 60

172
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:03,139
of these just to check here already do a
little and then open it again now

173
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:10,520
so now the winery is encrypted and we
are seeing I we're saying that the

174
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,780
battery is equipped as well so I too low

175
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:26,060
all the stuff its prey annoying it is
time consuming all the time so just

176
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:34,520
automate that all the process with I
didn't play items created using the pipe

177
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,800
and all the comments that you have
already seen just with one execution

178
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:56,270
everything is on using brother as I so I
thought here a little demo word and just

179
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,590
pull in a hurry

180
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:06,919
it's encrypted so just look at the
station their classes are recruiting and

181
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:14,180
just dumping the strings and charity is
weird is encrypted and rental income

182
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:24,830
pilot assembly sorry and you can see it
where as well and it can be a nice so

183
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:33,050
now they're going to get their strict
just select the application to do you

184
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:44,270
want to the great and just wait for 10
seconds or less and is that is doing all

185
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:54,500
the processes that I and now you have
here a battery already the great and we

186
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,820
are going to check it just do not right

187
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:05,419
i defied my balls so we have 2x right
there Michael hire a certified Michael

188
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:13,580
we are going to execute flowers or
Michael file not defied Michael fire and

189
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,610
then just a depressing and now

190
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:25,700
dresses and different debt and now trees
you can see these things and if you're

191
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,700
trying to disassemble the pickled egg
section it makes sense as you can see

192
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:49,220
now that we can see the world some
functions result so feel the work and I

193
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,190
just improve the speed because with some
minor ease is this bold action because

194
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:03,620
you need to make you different i had to
buy instances or just to just trying to

195
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:12,979
improve and to avoid repeat some work i
just tried to add some controls in a

196
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,360
frantic quacking that and not
conditional what they are doing but yet

197
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:27,620
some wineries that I can't recreate i'm
just writing such so try to do it in

198
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:37,250
something more native for example rest
alone has to to check before and just at

199
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:45,110
that's quick or program or whatever from
this we wish our repository Syria or 2pm

200
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:50,209
or whatever so that it

201
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,800
thank you all for reasoning and weapons

202
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:18,720
no question 6 the world do we have gym
break the ice . yeah really integrate

203
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,850
able to bring several and continue on
whatever it's not it's not possible to

204
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,860
yes but yes file regarding food

205
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:39,750
ah the one of the steps like we already
installed it so just you're ready to

206
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:50,100
iphones and then i compile that our copy
that fire into the right one and ridicu

207
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:59,010
e being in jail and really I like the
package and beyond

208
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,539
yeah you need to raise different there
at the moment internet always generate

209
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:33,000
anyway yeah it's not a lucky seven
different around your warrior love you
