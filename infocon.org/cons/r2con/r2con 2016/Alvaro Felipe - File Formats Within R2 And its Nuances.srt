1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
so we're going to talk about today I
fight for months

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,550
ok so for don't know um my name is
Laurel being called it love but other

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,590
problems like how i came across this
project because i want to learn about

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,090
virginity

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,779
hi hydrolysis is very expensive me and I
both I for one by blacks out of the

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,050
picture because I'm fine ok so those are
my handles and do you want to talk with

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,760
you about something okay so let's start
so well we are talking about five four

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,309
months are required for most important
forever on the answer is yes because we

9
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,019
all understand by former you're gonna be
able to get principles involved section

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,149
on you Amy you kinda startin to a nice
if we could get correctly . so it's very

11
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,480
important that I get your valuable
information when you're doing some

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:07,048
diversity of nowhere ocean and there's
questions are quite for mercy depart and

13
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,600
the answer is not again maybe for two
reasons is necessary to like about it

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,270
will put out the fire with different
standards so basically you're gonna

15
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,908
support the common cases and me prolly
CDF floors make my former client you're

16
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,280
gonna fail to start with information and
similarly is about security issues is a

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,159
huge effective face and you go on very
careful with your body going to grab

18
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,490
some other ways maybe red skills is when
I was born out of class already half so

19
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,869
you better be right

20
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,710
ok so for example to see some old games
person

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:02:00,059
ok let me show you the screenplay

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,750
ok so for example this school is very
non for everyone and if we try to do

23
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,280
these over this file whether you get
better at it

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,120
like that so with right across ok and
you can see here is because it's trying

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,730
to locate a huge father this is a very
common case when you try to fight . it

26
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,540
is interpreted correctly and you check
against negative ioz the site is greater

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:41,880
than the filesize so you're gonna get
crysis okay yeah another example so

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,690
Elliot is not all that these user to get
and documents must be very so it's

29
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,829
basically a person

30
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,890
some instructors in line so you get that
you're going to get some additional ok

31
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,839
it's very common to get this time crest
and if you do well directed to the short

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:25,709
code is good is very sequence for the
issues again hello is this year so the

33
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:32,190
person buying the first days in the
first dress we have here on macro a x CH

34
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,750
size that is really good in the site
from the system here so basically this

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,630
site is not triggered so maybe inside
raid on the right side that make no

36
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,590
sense is an attic value also doesn't
make any sense that you have to be

37
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,690
careful when updating offered with his
side's ok so you go direct to the short

38
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,109
course where is used here is using
directly / look at the mirror so you can

39
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:02,010
get really dressed and application ok so
you have to be able

40
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:21,880
so in the second case that we as the
Black II a you can see here directly we

41
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,900
already upset directly from the file so
. offset even check is beyond offered

42
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,799
probably your character reference memory
outside also do Hungary's ok so here we

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,450
are get the base offer we use it that
the opposite that we read directly i

44
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,770
can't get their friend

45
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,609
ok I'm basically here happened to you

46
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,270
so this is very common I'm not saying in
provided we don't have this is usually

47
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:07,330
because your call directly here you can
see out of dresses so we fix these not

48
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,460
over that it we normally see this right
away okay and you share by rebels killed

49
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:21,820
these very things here you can see what
aggressive with it

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,480
ok so it is sprayed on when you have to
be submitted to suppress so this is very

51
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:38,110
important part in mind about securities
ok so how everything is implemented yeah

52
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,240
and everything from a simpler for
analyzing from performance we usually

53
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,610
use plugins we have the transplanting is
eric wagon that is going to be uses with

54
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:57,190
flat a flat fee is 150 160 ok this is
what my client is being extracted

55
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,950
blanket that is going to be used with
for example that match the circuit nice

56
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:10,000
files that contain multiple 5k is a make
things easier to develop that companies

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,240
and we have to back in the short school
directory we have learned be in his

58
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,890
early yesterday is where you can find
all the plugins are variable initials go

59
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,400
i invisible by

60
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,109
is called as is use my appliance to
start reading the information

61
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,509
ok so yes we're looking at are those
places you basically can start

62
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:39,180
understanding how everything is is
implemented within whether it is Lee you

63
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,639
can take out for example have to blame
anyone

64
00:06:41,639 --> 00:07:05,130
ok but i will hear in bed like all these
instructors on its own it was like so

65
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,150
the first doctors you can see a little
color that is going to be used later for

66
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:16,289
a ride on it to get for example Texians
here as symbols imports strength is

67
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:21,419
containing in order to get is operating
. so this is the first thing that you

68
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:32,130
have to create another to supporting
fire . so if we go it is rectory here

69
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,280
you can find all that different from
other reports and well as the struct

70
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,190
plugins over here at you but my game so
you go for example to help

71
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:59,909
it's a bit tricky to moderate the agent
go to the air you can see how Henry for

72
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:07,139
hell is equal and again we going for the
colts to get symbols there sexy on the

73
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:19,169
patient's shots of world and the elderly
directory is coming don't use by

74
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,639
fighting the area basically normally
here's where the magic happens

75
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,340
where exactly the cord is in charge with
getting with a five then so many of you

76
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,189
have an issue you have a process to fix
you have to go directly here big so for

77
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,200
example 14

78
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,050
from the start everything is electronic
simple demo that is evolving and

79
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:48,560
actually called is in are all right
format is broken in the master so for

80
00:08:48,560 --> 00:09:30,439
example this is an assembled width in
which look there is of you is not ok we

81
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,850
get you can see can get the same
information but we are missing some

82
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,900
context ok

83
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,410
for example you can see here these
clothes but you don't know what is going

84
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,510
there but then you can see it's called
mrs. box and exit processes so somehow

85
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,569
we are missing symbols are locations and
we are basic principle is rotations for

86
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,380
data

87
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,050
this will be appointed to describe two
Springs so is broken so we're really not

88
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:14,030
work look so if we go into the shortcode
he is the folks on it is going to be

89
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:20,540
using the good singles across different
nice sophia you try to get simple here

90
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:29,630
it's broken you get a second chance
program so even this is implemented

91
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:38,630
somehow is broken and just went on to
thank the original is the reason is this

92
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,360
action is on how was meant to tell you
got there was about maybe I'll find it

93
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,150
was pressing right out of the time and
this is the reason you don't get

94
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,420
sango's and sections so that this index
a you have got to get these clubs called

95
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,750
like the process of the music box is
going to get your information

96
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:12,340
okay and I'm very simple rotation is not
even winded there so he's buried in golf

97
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:29,200
the replication is very simple and
second hitter so it is imperative you up

98
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,890
. a lot table of publications and even
ICU how much how many relegation ok so

99
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,610
yes using this information we are going
to be able to get the general location

100
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,050
information so I'm going to stroke
calling in life

101
00:11:44,650 --> 00:12:04,120
the bride's so so far questions why
these complaints home things you can see

102
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,020
basically all the plugins for those when
today is what they're told is great we

103
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,750
share the same parts okay instructor is
very easy to the play or greatly plugins

104
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,750
for simply analyzing a formal thing

105
00:12:42,070 --> 00:13:09,370
it's taking too long original done so we
are lucky we got singles now

106
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:21,700
ok we can find sections locations and if
you get this is simply going to your

107
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,720
intervention you already now that the
clients gonna be overlooking some

108
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,910
progressive box so you do kind of stuff
better just simply slice of waiting for

109
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,760
time to correctly the fire so that we're
busy here at the location this

110
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,230
renovation is not going to do this trip
so he's just doing work in progress but

111
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:47,620
you can see that it's crazy to start
parts you know or fixing the audio when

112
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,190
you playing out some new teacher that
you want to implement that's going

113
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,600
directly to this

114
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:02,200
okay so okay I we're gonna see two
examples how to import process one is

115
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,460
because about interpretation of this
conduct another one is dealing with my

116
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:12,550
friend files that provides is about
health elegance there tonight that its

117
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,640
use in linux system tool to actually
down the various I'm is basically made

118
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,240
an offer on I else here for the window
from here table with the seventies

119
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:34,390
market in the memory is impaired able to
get out is that section here is normally

120
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,090
used buses they here when debugging
process to give your information by is

121
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,220
not use when you write the letter E but
he used instead its programs here so

122
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,720
here we don't have that distinction in
mind you where we can get a different

123
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,990
output you know anyone that so for
example

124
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,050
what happens if we have been operating
without six and information so these

125
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,510
have been handling when I'm going
brother but I do try those stores proper

126
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:27,460
result of that fans to get a single
application gets this busy so here we

127
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,640
try up-down get symbols phone on and
thats been a stripper and he said I is

128
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:49,090
the device strong it's okay that's why
we help is saying the same kind of girl

129
00:15:49,090 --> 00:16:01,300
there E was not able to get information
then my dad was right with red area you

130
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,569
can see here we have our symbols we can
get also the location and then but I

131
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,750
help you again going to start the
program to go to me you can see that is

132
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:20,170
qualified supports other ways you will
be some clothes some direction that is

133
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,910
not waste my home ok so it's very
important I this for things like what ok

134
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:38,140
so next symbol that this is being said
last week and cannot permit and was

135
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,850
reported in Twitter so now for example
what happens when we have six months

136
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,310
later that says on specific object you
can find a single drink but in the brown

137
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:55,329
hear it said you have the system going
to get confused ok so we tried to work

138
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,330
is very intelligent

139
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:26,450
what it not that you can see here old
system and easy you don't have my that

140
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:33,470
in it says the print so for example this
is going to here and help

141
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:55,760
ok so what he means diddly about is this
game then take it you actually hear

142
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,510
upgrade from the leader brother was
saying your system and it was he is

143
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,129
because he is within the professor
person is a computer but doesn't make

144
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,050
intercom the front here

145
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:18,139
ok so if that is why Wilson hit the
spread . and he did it is right we

146
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:24,260
should we get kids here so this see
where it goes and you can see is go to

147
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,950
system

148
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:32,990
ok it's very easy to confuse these kind
of tools with these tricks ok and other

149
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,900
example that always broken about it and
it's basically the civil code is this

150
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,300
we don't have a system here get the
single france-presse here otherwise

151
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,340
other symbols on this computer fix
overlapping symbols are done

152
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,959
ok that is easy to the great but what
happened what we have any increases I

153
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,980
have one simple so you bypass the first
checks

154
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,880
okay but I don't listen to the simplest
problem here

155
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,559
so basically we have a lot this day and
this is

156
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:49,529
recently we passed this imaginary is
competitive master to see what happens

157
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,529
I'm totally and you're not

158
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,700
ok so here we can see we don't get any
symbols and is because we said in a

159
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,560
second here and we have one single so we
bypass and getting the symbol for like

160
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,080
you so you have to take into account and
back on by the branch again but I have a

161
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:44,220
fix for this here now we can see it
again was continued so yeah the

162
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,610
following example is we won't talk about
the year

163
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:54,570
yes the United a beautiful windows and
here we have yeah we have in mind my

164
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,889
permit clients if they will be given by
a responsible for communications what

165
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:04,830
happened is our postinfection from our
take something from the heaters that

166
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,179
make value over for example right
molecule impossible to my sexy on a

167
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,600
chance . so you have to overcome this
somehow

168
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:21,510
yeah so the meanest ok this brain . i'm
here because sometimes we have to deal

169
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,890
with very much from files and sometimes
can be lead to break it

170
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,740
ok so you know we have to discontinue
intercom when developing by four months

171
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,240
basically the solution is threatened to
think something that makes no sense for

172
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,120
example if an int . . you are not my
perception was appointed by section data

173
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,459
or maybe he's been at it doesn't have to
be sex young but it has been too . so

174
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,830
you have to present these other flight
en be able to get to la de our

175
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,970
application in the dinner to start a
really correct

176
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:06,870
ok so for example let's try and the
simple before so we're not get the

177
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,189
symbols we do little kicks butt out for
the temple we are going to take over

178
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,090
very well

179
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:51,900
some different to see using proper
listen more closely so you can see here

180
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:59,940
the heroes one here on what is you
number 6 years in 20 that so that is

181
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:07,620
maybe a position-by-position issue here
and address of android is 0 so doesn't

182
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,820
make any sense

183
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,590
so want to grab this area sexy shots and
hopped entry point you have to try to

184
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,379
fix it on the flat so this is the
difference

185
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,750
poker is what you get in this fight
because if material is not being

186
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,860
actually nothing because the minute he
says I don't have any sections at all ok

187
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:38,549
and this is what we get when the so we
actually we're getting gold and you can

188
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:45,330
see here you can see here we created our
section to try to market into . so it

189
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,460
doesn't wait we are by saying that week
from the format file to get to the start

190
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,510
knowing what is going ok and it's very
simple if this is not very complicated

191
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,510
is you go here

192
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:18,780
ok are in and once we get the sections
we round function days THX section is

193
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,780
very simple

194
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:31,020
so after this is not do the following is
watching the inquiry is always fine

195
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,900
other sections identity . let's go
beyond a fight sighs it's not right to

196
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,560
detect our section that if I how's the
executable be active okay I'm with that

197
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,570
we were able to learn a lot of my
workout before we were able to look so

198
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,470
maybe maybe the performance with
appropriate for a bit formal analysis

199
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,310
things things to disable their function
is not very complicated

200
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:04,320
I you can see here is the day that you
have to to change the supporting things

201
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:12,810
ok is reasonable for the interest in
malware analysis this issue is very

202
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,810
important

203
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:32,230
so here you can see that the stuff that
we have to support google among analysis

204
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,559
and you're really know where to start
looking

205
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,570
it's very easy and if you have to be
lucky memorizes the acting that i do

206
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:47,590
have to check out this issue and review
the start going on teachers because it's

207
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,720
very easy is it will organize everything
and you spend one day with circle is

208
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,200
very easy to pop so this is very
important in 44 where noises the article

209
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:07,720
looking out for my side is all the noise
and anyone has questions about

210
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,230
yeah
