[Music]

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,780
well this is the end of the conference

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:18,290
I'm really glad that at least half of

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,020
the crew won't make it but yeah I mean

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,759
it's it's always nice to see that there

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,240
is so much people interested in these

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,560
kind of things because it's hard to find

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,189
low-level guys that are really having

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,160
fun with all this kind of crazy so

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,440
I am really happy to have you here I

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,199
hope you enjoy the conference as much as

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:44,449
I did well I would like to say that all

13
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,659
the slides for all the speakers will be

14
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:49,489
published in this app repository they

15
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,440
will be sending pull requests and I will

16
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,809
be immersing this thing I will send the

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,540
links in the mailing by mail and also in

18
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:59,119
telegram and all the videos will be

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,619
uploaded soon as possible and this is

20
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,589
probably over like one week or two weeks

21
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:05,780
something like that but I have to reveal

22
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:13,399
them I have to edit them and cook and

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:15,079
upload that so that takes a while so we

24
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,539
will make the last two words around

25
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,820
right now we'll put some music if any of

26
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:22,850
the people who have been sending the

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,788
bots wants to come here and explain the

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,350
techniques or how they work in real time

29
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:29,719
because it will take like half an hour

30
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,469
something like this to finish your

31
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:35,178
fritter calling explain it so squatter

32
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:38,140
was a person who was in charge of

33
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:41,229
organizing the air towards competition

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,569
for those who didn't know outdoors is a

35
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:46,039
kind of simple game that consists in

36
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,380
multiple programs running in the same

37
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,579
memory space they have their own CPU I

38
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,889
mean this means they have like their own

39
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,499
CPU state like resistor state and so on

40
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:56,689
and they can be competing like different

41
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:59,240
characters so you can have like erm 64

42
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:04,158
architecture competing with a nick 66

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:06,530
CPU so but they share the same memory

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,209
the problem is that the purpose of these

45
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,520
BOTS is that they have been finding in

46
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,780
memory the other pot and overwriting the

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,450
memory in order to make the other

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,970
program crash as long as there are many

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,959
different techniques in there like

50
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,500
replicating itself like moving around

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,030
jumping up and down or just over writing

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,300
the data when you find something that is

53
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,830
not written by you for example it makes

54
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,100
the game quite interesting and also it

55
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,330
quite fun to follow because it's like

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,489
different characters and not all the

57
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,260
instructions are invalid instructions

58
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,500
for all the characters so sometimes you

59
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,929
can take some advantage to your game

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,230
players by abusing these kind of things

61
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,410
so we have three prices will be giving

62
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:53,090
them right now so hopefully all the

63
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:55,460
winners will be in the room so we were

64
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,240
giving like a book the bit boy which is

65
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,780
a game console I have here just like

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,970
this

67
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,770
it rhymes like Linux and there is like a

68
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,900
Raspberry Pi like CPU inside and you can

69
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:13,030
put emulators or whatever you like it's

70
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,860
also running r2 and there is a mousepad

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,740
there is also a notebook stickers and

72
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:23,830
many other fancy things so I will start

73
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,830
the competition now losing

74
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:49,390
I ever place-name it's the last person

75
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,390
but it's not the same name you sent it

101
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,190
hello my name is Annie so I have a butt

102
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,649
in here

103
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:21,220
I don't know when when this will finish

104
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,830
but I wanted to ask if we have any

105
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:28,450
participants here raise your hand if you

106
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:32,080
submit to the butt and keep your hands

107
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:35,050
raised if you did a simulation with the

108
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:39,010
other competitors did anyone try to

109
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:45,029
reverse-engineer them on maybe take a

110
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:48,250
picture that's what I did for for this I

111
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:50,350
just sat here the middle and then I

112
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,730
copied past not not even the

113
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,130
instructions because it's a bit

114
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,140
complicated especially it's x86 while

115
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,209
you you have relative jumps there

116
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,959
absolute and so I just copied X

117
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:03,849
directives and put them in a less

118
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,849
assembly file and then run outwards on

119
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:11,730
my machine so so I can simulate which

120
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:14,470
which one is which strategy can win so

121
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:17,700
yeah yeah I will publish that normally

122
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,410
with my write-up I don't know when but

123
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:25,330
but my butt is actually very simple it's

124
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,160
um 64 but it sits in the middle it's an

125
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,220
it's a heuristic

126
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,860
I found that again among the strongest

127
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,160
but they didn't write in the middle at

128
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,900
the beginning the world either at the

129
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
beginning of memory at the end of memory

130
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,670
so I decided to put my god there I don't

131
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:47,860
know if it's a good strategy but it

132
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:51,699
seems to work and it just does store

133
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:56,570
with the it has a loop with eight

134
00:16:51,700 --> 00:17:02,760
instructions I think and it does

135
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:06,680
one and six stores and one gem so it's

136
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:11,129
basically loops the arm 64 stores and

137
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,930
that's quite simple so you said I have

138
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,120
one eristic it's where the butt will

139
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,699
execute execute in the middle and the

140
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:21,810
second heuristic is where it will start

141
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:24,390
to overwrite so I don't remember the

142
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,750
exact things but you can find them if if

143
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,970
you if it runs long enough it must be

144
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,870
something it must execute at around

145
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,750
three zero X maybe 300 bytes I don't

146
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:42,600
know is here X 180 and it overrides that

147
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:46,560
around drawer it's 0 X 200 yeah so very

148
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:52,260
simple strategy no no big no big thing

149
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:56,909
yeah and it's my initial idea was to

150
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:00,960
write 0xff just FF because it's easier

151
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,600
to crush x86 BOTS but right now I

152
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,220
decided just true because there's a real

153
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,480
relocation at the beginning it just

154
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:12,300
rewrites the same but all over the

155
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,630
screen so it will writes itself so in

156
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,659
case just in case someone decided to

157
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,340
overwrite me and it jumps to another

158
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,100
instruction maybe there's a chance it

159
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:27,209
can leave I don't think so but yeah for

160
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:30,179
luck I would like to thank you because

161
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:33,900
you're the only competitor that found

162
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,880
and reported to bugs in in earthdome

163
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,560
that was related to seal I don't know if

164
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,650
you want to explain them or what you did

165
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,649
I'm not rendered to the first back to be

166
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,670
honest because I just was able to

167
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,920
reproduce it it was mostly so I reported

168
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,590
that to squatter who who isn't healed

169
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,130
Abel he was here yesterday on this

170
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,280
morning and he was about to find that

171
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:04,220
when running rather in r2 was there's a

172
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,220
setup to do the raw round robin and

173
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,200
when when we did which instruction was

174
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,039
it initial instructions I think it's

175
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,470
underflow is correct I think there was

176
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,408
an underflow so pancake fixed that yeah

177
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:24,490
I mean the problem said it was related

178
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:27,490
to the zero resistor in RM 64 because

179
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,929
when ad tours is saving and storing the

180
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,889
source storing and restoring the

181
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:35,259
resistor state of each of the CPUs it

182
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:38,559
was reading the zero resistor at zero

183
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:39,190
but then it was writing a 0 in the z-row

184
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,168
resistor

185
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,210
the problem is that when you write a 0

186
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:45,970
in the z-row resistor there was a back

187
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,830
in the register api that instead of

188
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,899
ignoring the right because it's gone to

189
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,769
zero it was basically writing in an

190
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:55,689
unlike offset inside the memory arena of

191
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:58,600
the resistor state so it was our writing

192
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,340
part of other resistors okay so for arm

193
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,820
it was like extra 2 1 is this your

194
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:07,509
sister and then it will write in X 0

195
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:09,070
instead of writing nothing yeah okay you

196
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,259
did I put records also for supporting

197
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:16,418
another instruction for oh yes I had an

198
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:21,129
idea from 32 but because with STM ia you

199
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:23,529
can dump all the registers from stack -

200
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:25,840
well usually it's for stack operation

201
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:28,389
but it can be used for fast named copy

202
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,879
for instance it's used to jump all the

203
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:32,469
registers to memory and with LD ni it

204
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:37,509
you do the opposite operation and

205
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:40,659
there's STM is supported in SL but we

206
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,529
don't have past increment so address IDs

207
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:48,659
post increment

208
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:48,659
yeah simple thanks thank you thanks

209
00:20:51,870 --> 00:21:08,189
anyone else wants to explain his

210
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:08,190
brilliance in there to worse ki be shy

211
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:21,220
I mean this my second year at the

212
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,680
conference and and every year I submit a

213
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,680
bot like who does that either the last

214
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,050
round the last run or the previous run

215
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:33,040
before that I don't know why other stuff

216
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:34,659
to do so yeah oh there it is running

217
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,170
right now so that's what it does the

218
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,820
blue one it just lives at the almost the

219
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,340
very end because somebody over write the

220
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,179
final the final bite so I don't I don't

221
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,370
touch that one

222
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,800
and then I try to go backwards because

223
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,110
most BOTS go forward and I hope that we

224
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,740
we have a we have a good clash over

225
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,629
there I think I didn't know until until

226
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:01,960
this run right here is that apparently

227
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:06,100
for x86 if you if you execute f4 in red

228
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,740
or it it's an ops it doesn't do anything

229
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,899
so I tried I tried doing that and

230
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,680
apparently most of the bots survived

231
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,030
that I did to to Corrections this last

232
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,050
version I shouldn't have done the other

233
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:22,300
one so I changed that to FF to crash x86

234
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,780
BOTS and hopefully maybe some more and I

235
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,280
also minimize the distance between my

236
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,830
rights which I should not have done

237
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,960
because it it makes less effective and I

238
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,179
lost at least one or two battles already

239
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,600
because of that so so yeah it's a super

240
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:42,220
super simple but nothing nothing magical

241
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:45,899
yeah it it uses push il at the beginning

242
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:50,130
to to write itself to to the end of

243
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,130
memory and then jumps there yeah

244
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:05,678
there are some robots around no one else

245
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:05,678
I know

246
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:23,470
come on don't be shy

247
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:23,470
oh when I explained it okay

275
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,699
so are towards competition is over we

276
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:25,529
have some winners first one is a nice a

277
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:30,779
please come here so we'll call the other

278
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:34,590
two winners the second one I'm here and

279
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:39,860
the third one okay perfect so we have to

280
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:39,860
sit first one okay

281
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:51,000
macaco but come here you wanna say you

282
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:55,770
some words yes this is my first board

283
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:03,690
and I use take a look at the other the

284
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:07,620
others boat and it's copied I just think

285
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:13,950
it at somebody and I think my best way

286
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:18,500
to feel best them the stuck and I think

287
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,500
this is this kappa no made bad things

288
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,340
surprise

289
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,250
so please captain

290
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,800
so when I say some words

291
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:36,779
yeah so yeah I wiped the start of the

292
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,450
game and the end and then it was all to

293
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,640
replicate myself with static offset

294
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,609
putting registers and something to them

295
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,480
though that's it

296
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,480
nice here's your price

297
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:53,960
and finally let me say you're nice I

298
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,629
don't know how you pronounce it and yes

299
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,500
I say some words again thank you very

300
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,600
much

301
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,580
I wasn't sure I would win against

302
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,210
captain because you have a very good

303
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,279
strategy

304
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,020
I actually dumped your body from this

305
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,750
morning but it's not the same version I

306
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,600
think yeah yes so it's a bit different

307
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,930
so when I started you won't do a

308
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,670
previous round I decided I won't change

309
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,399
anything it's maybe it's luck so I was

310
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:23,930
right for this luck you could have been

311
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,260
yeah thank you thank you Thanks please

312
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,259
advise

313
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:35,350
so now we will continue with the CTF

314
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,350
prices so I don't come to the same

315
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,000
so well I don't see Adam okay I don't

316
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:13,240
see the slice from here but we are going

317
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,619
to announce the prices for the city F so

318
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,770
this year we change to limit the

319
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:19,960
platform elects the person that it

320
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:23,230
should be here now but he couldn't make

321
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,970
it today we changed the platform and we

322
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,869
use city of D last year it was used the

323
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,939
Facebook platform I don't know if

324
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:33,460
someone watches him from the last year

325
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,220
we found that it was a little bit heavy

326
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,290
and not very smooth so we gave a tried

327
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,740
to City Fe and it was pretty nice this

328
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,570
year they were this year like 13 o'clock

329
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,649
means divided in different levels like

330
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:49,240
easy medium hard and I think 12 of them

331
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,390
they were solved only one he was not

332
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:56,580
solved and yeah we are going to announce

333
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,580
the prices for the first three winners

334
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:04,650
yeah so this year they were like a bunch

335
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,660
of you know different kind of reversing

336
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:12,070
challenges so this is one like like a

337
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:15,220
rod or a gameboy and they were also like

338
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:18,190
Android crack knees and most like kernel

339
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,020
exploitation and yeah and some more

340
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,380
different architectures and pretty much

341
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:27,330
everything related to the version so

342
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:30,940
yeah so yeah this is basically the main

343
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:33,670
square board the main screen with all

344
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:37,720

345
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:42,190

420
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:36,390
like and I also to say that there were

421
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,650
so many people playing the CTF so

422
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,830
congratulations also to to them because

423
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,840
there were so many some some things some

424
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:47,529
statistics about the city F so they were

425
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:50,740
like 300 something users registered in

426
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,600
the platform more than hundred of the

427
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:56,490
people they were at least having points

428
00:43:52,600 --> 00:44:00,310
so it's quite good so we were trying to

429
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:02,229
to to equalize the level of the

430
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,029
challenges so we try to give like easy

431
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,680
challenges for the people that you know

432
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,850
they are starting reverses and medium

433
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,770
challenge for the people they are

434
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,690
already advanced or you know medium and

435
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,300
also hard challenge for the people that

436
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:18,220
they'd like to know too hard to crack

437
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:20,170
like a hard nuts so one of the things

438
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,029
that happened this year is that the city

439
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,520
was not organized at the same time that

440
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,170
at the conference because last year we

441
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,270
have a rock people yes back in the

442
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:32,080
corners playing the city of the 24 hours

443
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:34,360
not attending the talks and we have the

444
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,040
feedback that they prefer to have the

445
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,140
city as one week before or like two

446
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:42,700
weeks before so for the next year I

447
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:45,160
think we will happen the same if if we

448
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,169
are going to sell sound like a forum to

449
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,480
ask to all the people that they play the

450
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,950
city if they have to if they want to

451
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,650
give some feedback for the next year to

452
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:56,259
improve because this is just a matter of

453
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,960
make it you know better a bit every time

454
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,940
and more playable for everyone so if you

455
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,190
were playing the CTF we will be sending

456
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,780
you like you know like a forum to to

457
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,820
keep something before the people that we

458
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,640
are organizing if you want to develop

459
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:11,100
some challenge next year and

460
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,040
you know you can send a email to read

461
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,560
our email and we will be continued to

462
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,990
you know to start developing the

463
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,580
challenge before the city s so with this

464
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:24,390
think I think I don't have anything to

465
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:27,000
say some great thoughts that they're

466
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,890
already online frozen the guy he was the

467
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,690
third one shared me the seg 1 and

468
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,430
capital and I think he was also playing

469
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:37,260
there are two were so a big applause for

470
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:43,040
you because you were everywhere so and I

471
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:56,040
think you didn't send any right up yet

472
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:58,320
sorry okay sorry if I slide yeah so

473
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,240
congratulations for the winners and I

474
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,100
think it was a great great idea for

475
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,470
everyone I enjoy it a lot even though I

476
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:08,299
wasn't player of this year and see you

477
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,299
next year so thank you

478
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:21,869
thanks Adam so we'll go for the pound

479
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:25,019
debian competition that's something I

480
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:26,880
wanted to do previous year the thing is

481
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,828
that there is something that is quite

482
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,480
annoying with non groaning releases

483
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:34,049
distributions and that's it that

484
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,730
distributions are shipping very

485
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:37,019
Albertsons of rubber I mean if you're

486
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,380
like running a server and you don't

487
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:43,379
really need the last features of each of

488
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,089
the services is fine and hopefully all

489
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,309
the issues that are found or fix it in

490
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:50,700
in master or in the last updates of each

491
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:54,359
application that you are using say four

492
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,359
are recorded in CB if I records so

493
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,950
people can basically get track or keep

494
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,450
track of all or all the patches in

495
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,919
master and then back for them as

496
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,410
security fixes for the stable version

497
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,210
and so on but the reality is not like

498
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,640
this I mean we have like 400 commits

499
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,380
every month

500
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,808
Debian is making basically for example

501
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,029
making an update once a year or 20 or

502
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:17,579
some studies so as long as the datum

503
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:20,789
stable is quite old I mean keeping so

504
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:23,549
for like three four years old trying to

505
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:25,440
let the people use or two from Debian

506
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:28,410
it's kind of dangerous because they will

507
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,859
be opening binary settle can be the

508
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:34,348
dancers I got tired about this situation

509
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:36,680
so I decided to make a competition to

510
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:38,400
let the people basically own all the

511
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,700
distributions that I'm shipping like

512
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,859
also Center for two and basically

513
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,989
decided to make this competition in a

514
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:48,630
way that you have to provide our

515
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:50,759
producer so you have to produce a binary

516
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:56,970
that when you load it it basically

517
00:47:50,759 --> 00:48:01,890
exploits or to the winner is the same as

518
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:08,009
the previous competition so thanks you

519
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:12,830
rock up here yeah welcome here explain

520
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,830
[Laughter]

521
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,730
gonna use these microphones

522
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,180
so yeah we installed Comic Sans for you

523
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:25,760
yeah so yeah explains the challenge we

524
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:27,710
originally started and searched for

525
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,760
memory corruption issues because that's

526
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,849
the first thing you do when you're

527
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,010
dealing with C code but we decided to

528
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:36,800
although there are some issues and six

529
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:40,400
are still open so yeah maybe someone

530
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,400
else can search for something we decided

531
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,890
to grab the get history for some issues

532
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,869
and we found it there were command

533
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:53,598
injection issues in the past I just

534
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:56,240
decided to scroll through the source

535
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,700
code and see where radar actually shells

536
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,740
out and cause an external command and

537
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,609
then I saw yeah it's calling Robin to

538
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:08,598
with some user input and it's not

539
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:11,119
sanitized I decided to fix it because it

540
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:14,030
was rather lame issue the payload was in

541
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,790
the file name so yeah it's not really

542
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:20,270
something you would open with radar and

543
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:23,630
while fixing this issue oh yeah I found

544
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:27,109
these four lines and I thought yeah what

545
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:29,750
the is this and it turns out these

546
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:33,589
lines are called when you type ood like

547
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:35,839
reopen a binary in debug mode so which

548
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:39,859
was decided to check out what dot is

549
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:43,490
Esterbrook actually does ISS rig prints

550
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:46,339
some some stuff it's quoted and it

551
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:48,709
contains a user input like this proc

552
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:51,410
name full is user controlled it's

553
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:55,640
actually read from a binary that you

554
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:57,649
supply the dot operator is like an evil

555
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,578
like if you know PHP you know evil is

556
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:04,640
bad and in radar land dot is bad with

557
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:05,660
user input and the exclamation mark it's

558
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,828
all stressed out

559
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:11,569
and you can call external commands so we

560
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:13,819
decided to craft a nice binary and

561
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:16,130
replace symbol names with like that take

562
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:19,940
it nice exclamation mark and your

563
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:21,680
command and if you type all the magic

564
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:30,390
happens

565
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:37,180
muchas demos so I'm showing the demo not

566
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:40,449
clear so I used the r2 version of Debian

567
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,448
[Music]

568
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:55,189
even less okay

569
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,189
so I saw if you can see its version

570
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:04,470
3.2.40 bien and for instance you can

571
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:08,520
open our binary demo and if you now type

572
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:12,810
or D you can see that the ID command is

573
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:15,810
executed and yeah this basically happens

574
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,940
because yeah we crossed the binary in a

575
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:19,259
way that ID will be executed it looks a

576
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,740
little bit different here because it's

577
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:27,600
in the relocations but yeah basically as

578
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:30,089
soon as you type already yeah yeah so

579
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,640
and after we've seen that it's

580
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:35,090
vulnerable we tried to deliver a hotfix

581
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,129
which turned out to be not a fix and

582
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:40,980
thanks to somebody else who to discover

583
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:42,540
that this is not fixing it completely so

584
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,910
as you can see if you just inserted we

585
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,860
try to quote it but if you insert

586
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:50,879
another double quote yeah then it would

587
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:54,120
still work as before so the guy also

588
00:52:50,880 --> 00:53:00,480
tried to fix it and yet simply replaced

589
00:52:54,120 --> 00:53:05,359
everything replacing everything that is

590
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:08,730
not alphabet

591
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,650
character but yeah turns out there's

592
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:13,500
some more if you look at PE binaries

593
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:16,110
then I asked for instance Hess has

594
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:20,280
another shows another command and still

595
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:24,840
contains yeah the command that executed

596
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:27,510
things so yeah next try was pancake he

597
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:30,510
added some more filtering and exclude

598
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,970
some more characters and yeah there's

599
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,980
some surprise

600
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:36,770
the time we made this light for just was

601
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:40,310
yesterday and we discovered it's still

602
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:43,400
stretchy so there are some things you're

603
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:46,390
missing so if you have if you have for

604
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,490
example yeah another PE binary and

605
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,770
crafts this simple like this then it

606
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:53,330
still works you can still have already I

607
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:59,750
can also show that with the latest

608
00:53:53,330 --> 00:54:06,049
version so we have a system or two I

609
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:10,600
compile it today and if you open put

610
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:22,730
yeah and type ood then yeah you can see

611
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:23,150
IDs executed yeah so we got an a CV for

612
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,880
that

613
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:30,650
yeah was rated with seven point eight

614
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:34,610
yeah and yeah this was from yesterday we

615
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:37,580
looked at the Debian bug tracker says

616
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:40,520
unfix actually true but they're just too

617
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:43,880
too slow there and with some lessons

618
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:46,460
learned from that so we thought it's not

619
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,350
the best idea to derive you say import

620
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,080
RTF commands from user input or from

621
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:54,080
untrusted input and somehow this

622
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,090
mismatches if you use commands that I

623
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,180
usually use by use internally as well

624
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:02,540
this yeah this the combination of these

625
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:04,009
two things lead to this attack and in

626
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:10,090
the end the up breaking things was much

627
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:10,090
easier than fixing it and yeah have fun

628
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,180
yeah I think that we all learn something

629
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,800
here

630
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:32,509
don't use our tool from I was used

631
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:34,490
to from the future so I hope that you

632
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:40,310
can send a reproduce er so we can fix it

633
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:41,629
before the party the kitchen I produced

634
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:43,400
before the party yeah I mean there is

635
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:47,000
like some pizzas in the middle but yeah

636
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,440
we can we can fix it so yeah so

637
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,640
congratulations

638
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,640
given the price

639
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:43,849
and the last competition with each

640
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,980
contribution complications many people

641
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:49,430
remember that last year we did a

642
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:52,130
hardware competition when it was

643
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:55,730
supposed to add a new new architecture

644
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:59,270
for adhara but this year we decided to

645
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:01,609
expand as a competition to almost

646
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:05,210
anything you want just should be big

647
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:08,270
enough and not trivial and we have a

648
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:11,660
three winners and the first winner we

649
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:14,380
decided to give it to people because

650
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:19,069
their contributions were comparable and

651
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:23,410
I would like to invite Giovanni and

652
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:23,410
Conrad to stage please

653
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:37,459
Giovanni added support for AMG 29k

654
00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:39,440
architecture and as you remember from

655
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:43,760
the country talk he added support for

656
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,330
ACO graphs and other interesting things

657
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,330
thank you

658
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:02,119
I'm a little bit disappointed by

659
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:04,940
everybody because I expected more

660
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:08,420
efforts at least in this competition -

661
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:12,619
you see more confident competitors

662
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:15,080
because I did mine I think a week ago

663
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:19,940
something yeah and I remember well yeah

664
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:24,470
and I expected to see more competitors

665
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:26,810
not just because it's a simple or at

666
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:28,459
least for me was an easy task just to

667
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:30,830
implement this one but maybe for others

668
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:34,880
not is not but there were a plenty

669
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:37,250
plenty of bugs to fix and features and I

670
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:43,550
really wanted to see more efforts but

671
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:46,630
maybe next year I didn't do it for the

672
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:46,630
price I did to improve

673
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:27,240
and they also have two more people

674
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:30,960
second and third place

675
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:51,598
so please flora and Markel and okie come

676
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:53,310
to the stage yeah I mean I was looking

677
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,349
at one of the presentations of the first

678
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:57,450
day and and there was a snoo Mouse thing

679
00:59:55,349 --> 01:00:00,450
implemented and I tried it immediately

680
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:01,830
and it was just all the menu was moving

681
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,879
right and left all the time so I thought

682
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:09,840
then that's terrible

683
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:12,330
so yeah fix it so yeah I just fixed a

684
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:15,090
small bug when you load it types from

685
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:16,770
from a see file like you had a struct

686
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,930
and then you load it the same struct

687
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:21,810
again but with different members then

688
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:24,690
you would get a messed up struct in in

689
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:27,060
the device so now it leads all the

690
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:29,270
structs that are reloaded and now it

691
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,270
works

692
01:00:33,960 --> 01:01:00,720
I want to say also special thanks for

693
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:06,830
our new contributors this year it's vile

694
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,830
oppa and Gustavo Gustavo is not here so

695

[Laughter]

697
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:42,480
[Laughter]

698
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:52,319
in the last word hopefully not my last

699
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:56,089
one we expect hopefully next year more

700
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:59,609
contributions we started this con

701
01:01:56,089 --> 01:02:02,250
competition 1 months ago but sadly not

702
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:05,130
much people noticed it's probably our

703
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:10,200
fault and we will try harder everywhere

704
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:12,830
next year so thank you and we hope we

705
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,830
will join us

706
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:24,840
so as you can see my commit those and

707
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:30,960
congas contributions so I didn't want

708
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:35,000
any price just this beer and this is the

709
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:38,160
end of a conference so it's over it was

710
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,930
for intense days it was amazing to meet

711
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,460
all the people here a lot of people

712
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,830
interested in the come in the project in

713
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,280
the conference and also in the in the

714
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:49,710
project so yeah I hope you enjoyed the

715
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,720
conference I got so good feedback at

716
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,940
least but they will probably set up a

717
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,189
survey and we'll send your mail it's an

718
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:00,110
animal survey so you can have to care

719
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:02,130
about spitting all the complaints to us

720
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:04,050
but we will try to learn from this

721
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,510
feedback and try to improve the next

722
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:08,520
year like with it in every year that we

723
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,020
organise this this conference I would

724
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,930
like to say thanks to all the people

725
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,790
from the organization that have been

726
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:16,859
helping me in organizing the conference

727
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:19,470
finding the place to offer the concepts

728
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,400
any place for the rooms or when I think

729
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:23,970
the price is organizing the

730
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,610
competition's the CTF everything so

731
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:28,439
please everybody that have been helping

732
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:33,620
in the organization also the angels and

733
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,620
and so on so calm yourself

734
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:59,629
don't be shy and this is probably the

735
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:01,750
first year that I've been kind of

736
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,880
relaxed while organizing the conference

737
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:07,190
so I would like to thank thank you all

738
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,049
for all the others who are we doing well

739
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:12,049
moving boxes registering people and

740
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:14,059
everything so yeah I guess that this is

741
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:16,119
for the first time that I could say that

742
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:18,230
I will repeat next time

743
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:20,619
so don't worry in order to connect see

744
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,619
you next year

745
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:36,009
so yeah there will be another token we

746
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:39,310
will probably have to think in

747
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:41,140
organizing like a better way to bypass

748
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,810
the front doors and avoid all these

749
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:45,279
mortal problems that we had this year

750
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:47,170
maybe setting up more than one

751
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,020
conference at the same time maybe making

752
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:50,950
like a real-time stream having ten

753
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,540
different tracks

754
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:55,689
also there have been some people asking

755
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:57,130
for more than one day trainings so maybe

756
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,630
we'll set up like two or three days

757
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:01,720
trainings about some specific topics

758
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:05,670
like advanced I think that adore entire

759
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,669
three-day training on earth to freedom

760
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,460
so yeah I mean there have been a bunch

761
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,540
of things and also there are still some

762
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,950
things from the conference that you

763
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:18,640
would enjoy they're not technical but

764
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:22,359
you will probably enjoy it right now we

765
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,129
have a break for dinner and you all are

766

776
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:55,540
