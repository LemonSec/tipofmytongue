1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:10,440
good morning I heard I hope you had more

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,200
sleep than me so 5:00 a.m. I was sending

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,189
the finishing the schedule for today so

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,310
this is the final result of the talks of

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,710
today there can be probably something

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,779
more what I think will be will make it

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,869
like this I have been some talks consult

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,119
like I said yesterday but it's quite

9
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,910
okay I mean I think that will be in time

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,269
and we don't know issues with that so

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,980
now we'll be doing the first round in

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,960
the morning offer tours I will explain

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,569
the issues and the professor's I did

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,340
tonight and also there are some changes

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,030
in the boat because are the new

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,610
submissions and I think they're like it

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:01:01,379
was 12 but nothing right now so there

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:04,500
are 12 watts so you can see no scales

19
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:10,580
are better and there is a legend I will

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,580
press play load on the bots

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:40,079
yeah so then the meaning of these colors

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:42,390
you can see the DC and magenta the

23
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,000
reason of these colors is because when

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,880
the but from the left side the blue one

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,350
is reading is using the the CN and when

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,119
it's writing and using the magenta and

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,788
the same goes for the other bottle so

28
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,420
using orange and yellow so you will

29
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:58,799
probably understand better the the color

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,420
photographs in the middle which is the

31
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,280
representation of the memory of the

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,530
process so basically one of the

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,560
participants yesterday found the back in

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,019
r2 and this back was basically when you

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,209
write an integer register and the

36
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,440
register is a zero sister and this is

37
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,470
something that cannot happen when you're

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,690
emulating because you cannot write in a

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,269
zero register because it's going to it's

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,160
where to ground and nothing should

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,390
happen I mean you can write into that

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,609
existed but nothing will happen the

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,018
promise that the implementation or two

44
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:33,299
was only handling the wire to ground

45
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,709
registers for reading so when you read

46
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:36,900
the register that is what to ground it

47
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,700
returns always zero but if you're

48
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,489
writing register that is wire to ground

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,899
it was writing trash in the rishis arena

50
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,639
so it was basically trashing the

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,790
resistor values and I fix it that

52
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,760
tonight so this is the last version of

53
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,260
the afterwards it's running on Mac

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,790
yesterday we're running this on Windows

55
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,069
mainly because the dotnet implementation

56
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,350
was working better but this is mono and

57
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,899
seems to work pretty fast and seems to

58
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,019
be fine so we'll see if nothing goes

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,019
wrong

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,710
yeah so have some fun

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,810

wrote that but can you come here
