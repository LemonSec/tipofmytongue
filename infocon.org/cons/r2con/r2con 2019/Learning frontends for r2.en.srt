1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,200
so I've been looking at the logo for

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:10,980
Darfur the past year or a bit more and

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,320
it's it's a cool logo but of course it's

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,590
not a secret right and contains the the

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,350
part that actually says reverse right so

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,689
I thought I'll make a presentation in

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,880
Reverse so I'll start in in the end and

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,460
and then then go back to the beginning I

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:34,890
hope you're ok with that

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:38,040
Thanks I'd really like to thank everyone

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,100
who participated in in the project as as

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,789
better testers

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:48,000
it was it was a crazy run but we did it

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,270
so thanks again if if there are no

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,690
questions at at this time this is where

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,610
you can download the tool so you can you

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,589
can use either the long link or the

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:03,149
short link however you want try it and

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,489
when you actually know what is right

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,310
what what you need is some prerequisites

21
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,710
you need radar of course right now you

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,200
also need unfortunately a bash and no

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,699
core hotels that might change in the

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,170
future but right now those are the

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,000
requirements for just to run an

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,159
installation is super easy right if you

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,740
know the link you do a git clone and

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,659
then you just just run from your console

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,199
works perfectly on Linux I hear that Mac

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,900
is is a bit worse and and Windows is not

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,799
as good but will will be working on a

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,970
multi-platform support in the future so

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,009
now I'm nearing the end of the

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,360
presentation I would like to show you a

35
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,390
demo of of the tool and as you know live

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,299
demos can fail but I always do live

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,149
demos because I love to live dangerously

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,450
well but this time I want to bring it up

39
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,640
a notch I'm upping the ante here so I'd

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,860
like someone from the ADI audience who

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,740
has never seen this tool before to come

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,780
here and do the demo instead of me

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,610
anyone please come up here

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,628
it's all you need to know is a bit of

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,980
Linux intended keyboard who has who has

46
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:14,660
seen the tool where am I

47
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,910
okay we have a couple people so the

48
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,349
other people guys girls come on one of

49
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,079
you you could have the chance to come

50
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:23,660
here sit down for a couple minutes and

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,720
oh I see many people thinking maybe I

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,010
took it off yeah we have someone yeah

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:38,930
cool cool come here

54
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:43,160
great so please sit down mm-hm

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:46,489
you can scream and the audience sees the

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,609
screen as well so go right ahead read it

57
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,000
carefully and and enjoy learning

58
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:55,370
learning radars so this person I've seen

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,620
around at the conference but we've never

60
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,200
talked I think so far yeah so a

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,410
completely random member of the audience

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,328
not really no trickery there now now the

63
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,709
person is looking at the ED beans all

64
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,970
right this is what you get when you when

65
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,250
you do get clone and when you launch

66
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,510
this shell strip this is what you

67
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,900
presented with so the first couple

68
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:19,548
levels the first three level levels that

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,630
are basically meant to to help you to

70
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:26,780
help you get acquainted with the

71
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:29,569
interface off yeah with the interface of

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,350
the tool more than fifty percent of the

73
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,888
test subject did okay no one did that

74
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,888
but

75
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,549
[Laughter]

76
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:48,099
okay seriously out of out I think we

77
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:50,500
said we had seven better testers and now

78
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,420
I'm actually that good rain but but many

79
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,640
of them typed 42 without typing the

80
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,530
answer first so the first level is done

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,980
and there's a three level just to get

82
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,599
just to get it started just just so that

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,579
you know how to use this interface and

84
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,619
then we can switch over to to read our

85
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,909
tools to having different levels about

86
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,230
you know rocks rod if and so on the good

87
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:13,390
thing is it's of course completely

88
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,980
expandable also it's open source you

89
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,139
will see the link to the github repo at

90
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,298
the end of this presentation so then you

91
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:24,030
can clone it and play around with it but

92
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:27,099
for now we are at level 2 and so yeah

93
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,359
our player here is trying to understand

94
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,360
how to skip a level

95
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:45,280
and the cool thing is you have these

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,780
skins right the creator of the level

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,669
might have not included the hint but I'm

98
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,580
a good person so all my levels have been

99
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:54,698
so far and then and now the final the

100
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,990
final challenge of our to learn and when

101
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,490
you finish level three then you

102
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,129
basically have learned everything there

103
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,840
is to learn about art to learn and then

104
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,979
you can start learning red or finally so

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,619
there you go

106
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:10,779
have you had a use ruler a lot okay okay

107
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:16,629
just just regard just the one command or

108
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:19,810
all the tools and the in the kids so

109
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:25,210
that should be easy for you then show us

110
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,550
show with the right answer well you can

111
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,529
I mean Punta Piedra that doesn't work I

112
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,330
mean you win the game but but but it's

113
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:36,520
not that interesting yeah but you can

114
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,740
use any razor commands you like but

115
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,270
rather commands of course mean the the

116
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,650
tools included in the rather talk is

117
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,650
right use this is a batch like shell

118
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,690
yeah and and if you want you can even

119
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,090
for these starting levels you can also

120
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,330
use the full graphical text user

121
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,500
interface off radar and and and do it

122
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,340
that way right but there are different

123
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,530
so yeah and and so on and it gets more

124
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,318
and more complicated we are missing like

125
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,210
99% of the levels right now but but they

126
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:25,229
do get more and more complicated slowly

127
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:27,388
up to to the CTF level right so I'd love

128
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,068
to continue the demo but but but I think

129
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:40,139
we have to move forward slice thank you

130
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:42,090
so much a bunch of applause oh sorry I

131
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,969
meant move backwards with the slides

132
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:50,219
okay so moving on there's a previous

133
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:51,990
slide so as you as you've seen it's a

134
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,669
cool tool so it will be great if you can

135
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,979
contribute send your pool requests but

136
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,530
not only that suggestions for tasks are

137
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,479
welcome you don't need to actually send

138
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,150
send a full pull request I'd be happy to

139
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,400
implement if you have if you have a good

140
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,020
idea and also issues for tasks and the

141
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,698
app itself so once again if you don't

142
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,490
wanna do a PR whatever just just just

143
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:17,009
make an issue so it's extendable so you

144
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,909
can also set up your own tasks so how do

145
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,940
you do that

146
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,979
it's quite simple you use a bash script

147
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,050
the super simple bash script it simply

148
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,990
has a bunch of variables in it and you

149
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,750
define them so the main variable is this

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,180
R to learn version this is not the

151
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,180
version of the task that you update over

152
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,770
time this is a version of the config

153
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,659
setup right in case in the future we do

154
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,139
some changes that are incompatible with

155
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:45,210
the previous ones then we can you know

156
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,680
distinguish between those and then you

157
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,138
of course have the task name write

158
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,870
whatever you want we have the task and

159
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,639
if you want to do multi-line tasks as

160
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,190
you saw in the demo as you will see in

161
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,960
the demo then you can of course just use

162
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,779
entrance inside double quotes as bash

163
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,190
support that hints if you want you

164
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,599
specify hint if you don't then you

165
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,279
remain

166
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,229
but you still you know can just leave it

167
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,058
empty or not that's fine by the way out

168
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,589
of these currently four versions one

169
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:12,979
all of them are optional you don't need

170
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:15,770
to include any of them it just works

171
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:18,080
and in case the next level is not this

172
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,599
level plus one right three to four but

173
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,359
another level then you can specify which

174
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,919
level is going to be the next when the

175
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,580
contestant successfully solves the

176
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,378
challenge but of course it only would be

177
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,998
interesting if we can actually verify if

178
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,399
the answer is correct or not and there

179
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:39,979
are multiple ways for our to learn to

180
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,870
verify what you've been typing one way

181
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,940
to do that is using this artillery

182
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,220
command it looks at the last command

183
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,680
that you've run in the interactive radar

184
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,839
interface and if it matches then it's

185
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,638
all great the color is green here

186
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,709
because that indicates a regular

187
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,040
expression that's what the slash is

188
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:59,388
there so it's a bit you know it's gonna

189
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,130
get a bit tedious if you have a lot of

190
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:05,449
special characters in commands but but

191
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,360
then again you can you can easily

192
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:10,279
specify multiple choices or specify

193
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,759
approximate answers and and be able to

194
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:16,279
accept them or we can do our to learn

195
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,319
answer which means this is either what

196
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,110
the user taps in using answer and the

197
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:22,670
answer or once again the the output of

198
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,889
the last command the last line is the

199
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,300
last command will also be recognized and

200
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:28,160
automatically by the way you don't even

201
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:32,120
need the type answer manually it will

202
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,670
just say congratulations and so and

203
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,589
these these two can be used

204
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,790
interchangeably and at the same time you

205
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,470
can have both of them for the same

206
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,139
challenge right you can validate using

207
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,269
either of them but you can choose a

208
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:48,230
third option which is not compatible to

209
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:52,339
these two which is a post exact so that

210
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,410
means two things it means you can run a

211
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,449
custom command and check the result for

212
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,130
example if you need a user to modify a

213
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:00,500
file and you want to verify if it's been

214
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,600
modified correctly you can do that and

215
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,660
the second thing it means since you can

216
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,089
run random boundaries you can easily

217
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,550
gain control of the users machine if you

218
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:15,870
submit a level so do submit a level

219
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:18,719
please I will show you the demo of

220
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,420
how you can actually create your own

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,670
levels and afterwards you will see all

222
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,439
the specs for for each of the parameters

223
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,439
for the levels of we can have

224
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:46,829
it's okay so we do have oh yes that

225
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,380
would be that's perfect we do have the

226
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:51,899
folder levels this is just simply you

227
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,000
know cloned from from the the internet

228
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,649
you will see the URL at the end of the

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,500
presentation so you can play around with

230
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,790
it so we can just take a template and we

231
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,259
can create in your level let's call with

232
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,509
$9.99 for now

233
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,430
by the way level numbers can also be non

234
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,750
numbers like non numeric but then you

235
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,969
know you have to specify the next level

236
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,730
manual as a recipe first level one we

237
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,949
copy the template here and we have a

238
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,050
config file obviously in there that's

239
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:26,519
your config file so they're super secret

240
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:31,079
tasks please crash or dark that's the

241
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:35,730
task and and then post exact might be

242
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:37,979
big rap radar to write and post result

243
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:42,420
should be empty yeah so I think I think

244
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,399
that's that's a thing whatever next

245
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,209
level whatever let's remove that so

246
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,829
that's that's how it looks over here we

247
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,469
have configure we can we can also add

248
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,449
some binary files we want they will be

249
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:59,009
visible this does doesn't need any but

250
00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:01,620
we can like copy bin was that been

251
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:06,660
through over here like that

252
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,689
and now we just run around the thing it

253
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,350
whoops

254
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:15,540
like that we run the thing and level 9 9

255
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,680
9 and there we have this is our level

256
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,910
right we we need radar we crash it

257
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
somehow and then we solve it right

258
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,079
radars uncrashable so we can't really

259
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,829
solve the level too bad

260
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:31,589
so that's how you create good Joker than

261
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,359
that that's how you create levels for

262
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:35,069
for these things right and and in the

263
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,779
next slides you'll see all the possible

264
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:40,069
specs you can you can put in the config

265
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,069
file for for the levels

266
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:49,240
now I created this great tool called our

267
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,329
to learn and it's basically bash like

268
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,040
shell that allows you to run only

269
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,020
commands from the radar suit that means

270
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,780
you can you can play around the sword or

271
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,280
you can try to learn radar and it has

272
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,900
history supports you can actually press

273
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,790
up and down left and right and it still

274
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,709
works it's like oh it's like real bash

275
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,260
bash shell doesn't how about to complete

276
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,150
though that's that's a pity

277
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,490
good thing is it can be used for intro

278
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,050
training like you can give some basic

279
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,700
basic intro at the end of the

280
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,500
presentation you will see we can we can

281
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,750
do like racks to intro for example

282
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,960
trying to teach people basic commands

283
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,030
the Fodor has we can also have some

284
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,830
tasks added that would allow people that

285
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,400
have been using gdb their whole life

286
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,850
like I have for you know most of my

287
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,730
lives

288
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,250
to switch to radar easier and we can

289
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,280
even go to CTF level training right

290
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:45,310
having some supercar challenges so it's

291
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:48,069
quite extendable now that's me

292
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,959
my name is Goodell solos I'm a lead

293
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,690
researcher at possible security from

294
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,030
Latvia I do a lot of stuff I usually

295
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,010
hack things I break things

296
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,720
so originally I'm interested in networks

297
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,500
love analysis that's where I started

298
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,870
around 10 or 15 years ago the reverse

299
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,030
engineering is a cool thing that I've

300
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,550
been doing for the past like five years

301
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:12,790
I'm social engineering about the same

302
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,290
time and legal dimension I actually love

303
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,089
paperwork as well so I'm one of those

304
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,790
strange guys it does low-level stuff and

305
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,260
super high-level stuff that's my webpage

306
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,900
close that works light are gonna be

307
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,910
there and of course the official github

308
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,260
repo as well you can also find a bunch

309
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,810
of different other slides on reverse

310
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,270
engineering policy and everything in

311
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,400
between on the website so go take a look

312
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,160
and do follow me on Twitter a tweet on

313
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:40,329
only in English so you're safe you can

314
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,920
you can follow my crap over there so

315
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,870
this is my presentation about or to

316
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,490
learn your personal interactive teachers

317
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,590
it's interesting that during a CFE

318
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,220
process I submitted my idea to to

319
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,230
pancake

320
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,360
no I said I've I've made this small

321
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,340
script that that that can be used to

322
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,930
teach people to use her door and you

323
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,430
know what he said he said wow that's

324
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:06,020
great I also made one yes tell me he's

325
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,819
been working I don't know working on it

326
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,199
or sitting on it for a year but but

327
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,230
anyway so he made one obviously

328
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,330
obviously in C nutshell it's a similar

329
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,740
tool it's it's called r2 golf and you

330
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,940
can find it in the report that you will

331
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,090
see at the end of the presentation in

332
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,670
the folder underscore rather and here to

333
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,930
tell you about the tool or to go if we

334
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,979
have a very special guest

335
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,979
please welcome pancake

336
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,220
[Music]

337
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:17,370
so thanks for having me this is my first

338
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:20,699
tote in this conference my presentation

339
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,710
is about golf which is a plug-in for to

340
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,310
the tie rods basically for teaching how

341
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,530
to use or how to solve some problems

342
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,359
using our tool basically to get used to

343
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,520
the commons and understand what are you

344
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,960
doing and the thing is that I was

345
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,390
interested in making some kind of

346
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,710
gamification over two so basically it's

347
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,930
a plugin that it's counting the amount

348
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,180
of time that you try back online

349
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,650
and until you solve a problem so the

350
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,630
last comments you'll type until you

351
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,550
solve the problem they're higher the

352
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,920
more stars you get and the more stars

353
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:54,240
you get the easier it is to go to the

354
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,060
next level so it's basically plugging in

355
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,280
written in see the challenges are

356
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,829
written in Magdalene I was trying to

357
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,689
find like a file format that was kind of

358
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,089
easy to type and ec2 purse

359
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,339
so I was experimenting with goai with

360
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:11,700
xml with which is obviously not the

361
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,069
right format I was also thinking in

362
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,540
using JSON but typing zation my human is

363
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,010
not something that you want to want to

364
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,079
do if you want to get like multi-line

365
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,359
things and compare the output and stuff

366
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,520
like that then there is channel but

367
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,169
channel the it's extremely complicated

368
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,879
for what it is I mean it things it

369
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,120
minimum partial I found it was like

370
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,090
6,000 line something like this so I end

371
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,540
up like writing a magnum parser in in

372
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:40,409
119 see there is like one callback which

373
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,420
is basically taking the event of which

374
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,080
can element is found in the markdown

375
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,270
file and it basically takes the title if

376
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,429
it's a list the content of the body etc

377
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,410
and this is used for loading and all

378
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,650
information of the of the challenge in

379
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,830
in memory for supplying it supports also

380
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,380
hints there is a test fit light

381
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,149
verification means that every time that

382
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,820
you type a comment it will execute one

383
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,620
common and compare the output so for

384
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,600
example if the Challenger is find the

385
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,159
function that is doing something or it

386
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,810
will come it will check if the current

387
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,240
offset is the one of the of the function

388
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,790
I mean there are many ways to do that I

389
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,320
mean you can maybe in just sit on all

390
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,740
the functions but you can I mean the

391
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,230
idea that you should be doing

392
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,050
kind of things but there is a plugin can

393
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,460
be extended to provide multiple checks

394
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,980
at different levels and things like that

395
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,809
so you can for example 95 the binary

396
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:36,100
have been analyzed or some specific

397
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:38,530
comments have been executed before so

398
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,219
yeah it's not reduced under to it miss

399
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,260
to work so it's basically and only it

400
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,170
runs inside the shell so you cannot

401
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:50,800
verify the rub into racks to use of the

402
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,420
tool like the other plugin show and also

403
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,669
power the most important thing is that

404
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,990
it's feature it's featuring clipping

405
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:03,730
which is the one who is giving you the

406
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:06,670
scenes so it's time for a demo so as you

407
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,880
will see this is the rode rec target of

408
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:12,970
the project there is a readme the result

409
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:20,350
so this is a markdown parser the module

410
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:27,370
passion is really quite simple you will

411
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:29,439
see just like 100 lines the description

412
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,020
of the test are like this I only wrote

413
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,580
two different levels it are very basic

414
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,679
but I expect the community can be

415
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,580
contributing on that and we can have

416
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,559
like multiple levels for tutorials and

417
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,740
that can be integrated in their notes

418
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:47,800
for example or in iOS or in a website or

419
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:51,660
any other place that you can run to so

420
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,970
this is a h1 title so the bigger one

421
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,809
defines the category then there is a

422
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:02,320
description in there is like the key

423
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:04,480
value if it is like a colon in the line

424
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,309
it can be used for describing some kind

425
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,929
of hash table values then there's the

426
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,000
description all the stuff is something

427
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,309
that Clippy will be telling you when you

428
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,750
run the thing and then you can add some

429
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,420
metadata that who is the author of the

430
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,059
plugin which is the input file which are

431
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,280
the hints and then which common should

432
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:23,800
be run to be verifying that the thing

433
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,600
has been working properly and then the

434
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,860
xpect which is the thing that should be

435
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,540
comparing to with the output of the

436
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,909
common so as long as I do make sense for

437
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,690
everything I didn't make fail to compile

438
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,670
and run

439
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,100
the plug-in to run the plugin is

440
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:42,760
basically installing it and then use the

441
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,370
golf common so if you take make will

442
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,080
build the thing and will execute the

443
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,919
game so the first thing it's a

444
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,840
numerating all the plugins that are in

445
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,910
the tee directory and then it's ask you

446
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,689
for the number so i will pick the first

447
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:02,860
one it says this is the difficulty level

448
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,690
easy small front size so this is

449
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,729
exercise about learning how to read the

450
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,590
assembly code and moving around with two

451
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,720
you have to stick at the beginning of

452
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,040
the function that brings the usage help

453
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,920
method so we are here we don't know

454
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,560
which file it's listing so maybe we have

455
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,350
to use the command o to list the comment

456
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,139
the files that are opening here we can

457
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,570
maybe use a to analyze all the functions

458
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:32,110
or maybe just a turn lights all the

459
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:37,540
references so maybe we can just find a

460
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:40,020
reference to usage maybe you have to

461
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,020
analyze more

462
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:51,100
that's lowercase so now if you bring the

463
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:53,408
friend the first instructions you will

464
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,658
see that there is like a reference so we

465
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:59,260
will seek to this function and

466
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,679
congratulations you solve the first

467
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,600
exercise if you run the golf common you

468
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,010
will see there are some sub comments so

469
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,840
you can kill the current session you can

470
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,879
create anyone you can get a hint

471
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,168
you can test that something is working

472
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:17,049
or not etc so that's the current so

473
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:19,929
there is a golf stat which give you the

474
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:22,090
amount of common type how many times you

475
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:24,070
ask for help and things like that at the

476
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,610
end it's way to get some statistics from

477
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:30,100
the player I brought that plugin like

478
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,779
almost a year ago it didn't have much

479
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,570
time for improving it but as long as he

480
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:38,020
submitted the same tool that I wrote it

481
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:40,299
was kind of a mess to not make a quick

482
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,908
talk explaining how the plug-in is and

483
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:44,350
publishing it and maybe find some

484
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:47,100
contributors to write more tests and

485
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:51,129
more tutorials on levels for this game

486
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,139
so thanks again I hope you like this

487
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,520
game and you will probably be playing

488
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,520
around the next days

489
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:13,220
any question nope okay microphone

490
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,710
hi are their levels linear or mister

491
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,950
yeah for now it's it's just linear I

492
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,169
mean there is one level of the lower one

493
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,179
but there will be nice if there is other

494
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:41,820
ways to construct or to organize the

495
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,500
different level for options so depending

496
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,809
on what you solve you can jump to

497
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,370
another level or that's what do you mean

498
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:50,549
or yes exactly

499
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:53,909
yeah actually what I was thinking is

500
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:56,700
every time that you win a game you get a

501
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,179
bunch of points and in order to get to

502
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,530
the next level you have to accumulate a

503
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,570
specific amount of points so it's not

504
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,870
just you finish something and then you

505
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,850
go to the next I mean something that you

506
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,408
have to accumulate most points like

507
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,240
solving the correctness in the or the

508
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:14,520
solution to the problems in a specific

509
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,440
amount of time or solving with less than

510
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,629
three comments for example so you get

511
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,929
more practice after repeating the same

512
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,929
things multiple times more questions

513
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,510
okay thank you
