1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,910
good afternoon everybody my name is

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Matthias Jeff I'm with the University of</font>

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,299
kaiserslautern in Germany and I'm going

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,449
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about secured shrek verification</font>

5
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:18,359
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you a short</font>

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:21,859
introduction how the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> air traffic</font>

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:25,230
surveillance system will track airplanes

8
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:28,740
that's a technology called a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,070
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple the airplanes are</font>

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,160
simply flying and broadcasting their

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,990
positions periodically and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Crown</font>

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,660
stations for instance or other airplanes

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,250
but i'll look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> crowne stations ground</font>

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,500
stations can receive these position

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,090
reports and then process them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,600
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to the air traffic controller</font>

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,550
for instance so that you can basically

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,310
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current situation</font>

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:59,699
based decisions on this data so but as

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:03,090
the aviation industry usually puts lots

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,610
of efforts in in safety rather than

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,250
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no security involved</font>

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,160
so this position report they are not

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,160
authenticated or encrypted or anything

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,899
so there's we came up with this simple

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,229
the text scenario you have an attacker

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,680
and the attacker can simply inject fake

28
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,050
position reports what then happens is

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,890
that that the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic controller</font>

30
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:32,370
suddenly has like points on her screen

31
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:35,479
that are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there so he bases</font>

32
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,700
decisions may be critical decisions on

33
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">fake data and that brings me to the</font>

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,260
problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve we've</font>

35
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:48,960
secured track verification we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,350
answer the question whether a claim

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,199
track so a sequence of location claims

38
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,070
is actually true so it's the airplane

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,630
actually flying there those of you

40
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,880
familiar with location verification

41
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,798
might now think all right this has been

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,598
solved during the last decades several

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,180
times and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely right you</font>

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,260
could do a point wise verification of

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,739
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> position</font>

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,689
but in the context of this aviation

47
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,909
scenario this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit problematic</font>

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:25,140
because these solutions for location

49
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,450
verification they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,298
properties that make them unsuitable for

51
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,280
for this scenario so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance you</font>

52
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,010
have distance pounding protocols where

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,769
you use some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenge response</font>

54
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,239
protocol in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to derive a upper</font>

55
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,519
bound on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance between sender and</font>

56
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,409
receiver and you can by doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:50,670
do you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify the distance well but</font>

58
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:52,888
this problem uses like dedicated

59
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,200
messages like messages that are

60
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:57,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">dedicated to location verification and</font>

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,518
in aviation you cannot simply change

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,149
protocols so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use if you introduce</font>

63
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,879
a new technology in aviation that lasts

64
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,909
about 20 years so you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of</font>

65
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">design and certification and another 10</font>

66
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:15,120
years of deployment of global deployment

67
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:20,209
so that's not an option at least for the

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,349
short term the second category of

69
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,109
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solutions to location</font>

70
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:27,899
verification problem they measure

71
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,030
certain properties of the received

72
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,389
signals and then they check them

73
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,549
basically for consistency such as the

74
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">angle of arrival for example and they</font>

75
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,250
check whether the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from the</font>

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,129
right direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok as one of the main</font>

77
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,629
objectives of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the future air</font>

78
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:50,268

79

reduce the cost and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,730
and you need specialized hardware for

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,030
this kind of protocols this is more or

82
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:04,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">less contra productive to this objective</font>

83
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">right there's another popular solution</font>

84
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,299
to the problem like where you have a set

85
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,760
of synchronized antennas and by

86
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,739
measuring the time difference of arrival

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,260
of a signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the different antennas</font>

88
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,260
you can basically estimate the origin of

89
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,750
a signal but this again requires very

90
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,840
tight time synchronization which is

91
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,920
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> again also a contra productive</font>

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:33,159
when it comes to cost

93
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:35,600
yeah there are also solutions that

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,890
establish security by limiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,260
adversary's knowledge so they assume for

96
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,810
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have hidden base stations</font>

97
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,240
and they assume and that the position

98
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the exact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> position of the receiver is</font>

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,650
not known<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the attacker well while</font>

100
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,300
this might work in some military

101
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:58,010
scenarios this won't work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil</font>

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">aviation scenario because you have so</font>

103
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:04,159
many players in the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this kind</font>

104
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security by obscurity well not a good</font>

105
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,940
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably however the last point</font>

106
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,990
that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> these location where</font>

107
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,480
ification solutions unsuitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

108
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that we have an inherent</font>

109
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,250
mobility here so the airplane cannot

110
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,979
stand still until the protocol run has

111
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:31,400
finished right it is moving all the time

112
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in fact this property turned out to</font>

113
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,010
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really beneficial for us so while the</font>

114
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,230
intuition might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly</font>

115
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,270
instead of verifying a single position<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

116
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,520
have to verify a sequence of position

117
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,560
you might think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a harder problem</font>

118
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,380
but in fact it turned out that you can

119
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get rid of all these previous</font>

120
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,409
system requirements by including this

121
00:05:51,470 --> 00:06:00,440
mobility into your scheme so how did I

122
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:03,640
do that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens when the airplane</font>

123
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,620
is moving while<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's claiming positions</font>

124
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,719
the distance to the receiver changes

125
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,240
constantly so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

126
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,970
distance for each location<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim and</font>

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,360
this results in an effect that in the

128
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:24,070
effect that this constant transmission

129
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,510
rate gets from the view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the receiver</font>

130
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:30,080
somewhat distorted because the

131
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:33,860
propagation delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the signal changes</font>

132
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,599
for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> location claim ride this effect</font>

133
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,470
is called the mobility differentiated

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:45,790
time of arrival and yeah if we have

135
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,790
little closer look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it we can</font>

136
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,620
establish we can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up a very</font>

137
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,360
simple relationship between this message

138
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,550
inter arrival time at the receiver and

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the inter transmission time at the</font>

140
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,720
transmitter and therefore we look at the

141
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,750
inter transmission time which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is delta</font>

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,660
IJ<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two location claims</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inj and we</font>

143
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,250
have the inter arrival time so the

144
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,100
duration between the arrival of two

145
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,760
claims which is at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X which</font>

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,910
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> denoted by delta i j x and we have</font>

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,190
the two propagation delays of the bowl

148

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">following relationship so the inter</font>

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:32,479
arrival time equals the inter

152
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,810
transmission time plus the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference in</font>

153
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:39,070
propagation delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that is the</font>

154
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,540
simple relationship which basically

155
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:46,880
describes this effect i just mentioned

156
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:50,419
and if we put this equation in a

157
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,050
security context we can distinguish

158
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,030
between trusted and untrusted values we

159
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,550
trust the values that are derived<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

160
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:05,270
receiver and cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tampered with by</font>

161
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,370
the attacker which is in this case the

162
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:12,500
time of arrival measurement so the the

163
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,270
inter arrival time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then we assume</font>

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the the receiver is not compromised</font>

165
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:19,669
of course so and all other values they

166
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,729
can be controlled basically by the

167
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:26,680
adversary by<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjusting transmission</font>

168
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:32,838
times or claiming false positions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

169
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:35,530
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and our idea now was what if</font>

170
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:40,400
what what happens if we simply check

171
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:43,789
this equation so if we simply check what

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,740
I see is it what I should see right

173
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:50,650
based on the data the disclaimer I did

174
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,650
bye-bye the proven by the moving object

175
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:59,170
so if you have one receiver this does

176
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,730
not establish any security at all

177
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">because as you might see the attacker</font>

178
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:10,150
can simply adjust the transmission times

179
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,310
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the position reports the</font>

180
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,600
location claims<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrive at the receiver</font>

181
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:20,920
as it expects them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this does not</font>

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:25,029
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all but if we had two more</font>

183
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:30,060
receivers at different locations we can

184
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:34,020
formally prove that if all receive us

185
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:38,859
independently check this simple equation

186
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:42,220
the attacker will violate this equation

187
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,870
at at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least one of the receivers and we</font>

188
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,250
can formally prove that so that's that's

189
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:50,260
a very nice thing actually because this

190
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,930
equation<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be checked independently of</font>

191
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,930
all other receivers so that means we

192
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need any synchronization between</font>

193
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,920
the receivers we also we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need any</font>

194
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,500
synchronization or additional

195
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,120
communication between the receivers and

196
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,830
the the airplane in this case so it's a

197
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,589
completely passive scheme and that's

198
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so by including</font>

199
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:20,920
this mobility we managed actually to get

200
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:23,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of these system requirements yeah</font>

201
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,829
but all of you know probably that there

202
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,339
is usually a gap between practice and

203
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,070
theory because in practice you don't

204
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,630
have like perfect measurement values you

205
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,930
always have some noise in your

206
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:42,400
measurements right and in our case you

207
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,280
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise in the position</font>

208
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,250
reports due to for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS in it</font>

209
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,140
inaccuracies you have measurement noise

210
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,720
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you measure the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamps the time</font>

211
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,260
of arrivals and so on and we summarized

212
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,240
all these random noise sources in a

213
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:03,640
normally distributed random variable and

214
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,080
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> added another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source of noise which</font>

215
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,670
is the clock drift

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,830
which influences basically the

217
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:16,540
transmission rate and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course what the</font>

218
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,610
what the receiver expects and with this

219
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,380
noise model in mind we extended this

220
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,880
basic verification scheme where we

221
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:31,330
simply check these equations in a way

222
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:34,270
that we use all location claims we've

223
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,720
received over a certain period from from

224
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:42,340
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brutha from a mobile bruva to reduce</font>

225
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:46,350
this measurement error in our check for

226
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:51,160
consistency<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay therefore we start with</font>

227
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:52,900
estimating the clock drift by taking the

228
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,719
mean linear deviation of the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

229
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,020
the right hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of this equation and</font>

230
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,750
in the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> step we calculate the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

231
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,150
squared deviation of the left and the

right hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> side over the whole flight by</font>

233
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:11,560
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the at all pairs of position</font>

234
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:16,930
reports we've received so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

235
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:21,670
overall eyes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jays the question now</font>

236
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verification value I end up with</font>

237
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:29,170
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allow us to perfectly</font>

238
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:32,790
separate fake flights from real flights

239
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:37,199
right that's that's what it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

240
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:40,750
we did some simulations where we took

241
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,580
thousands tracks from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database of</font>

242
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,970
the open sky network which is a project

243
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:52,210
that monitors air<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic for research</font>

244
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:55,560
purposes and to these tracks we edit all

245
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,960
data we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need it by simulation the</font>

246
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">timestamps we needed the noise we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> edit</font>

247
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:09,250
the noise and we run a simulation using

248
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:12,069
this data for two cases one where the

249
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,290
tracks were fake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one where the</font>

250
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:18,279
tracks were real and we looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

251
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:21,569
results and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that</font>

252
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:24,129
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually determine a threshold</font>

253
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:26,079
that's perfectly separate so what you

254
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:28,230
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here is the false</font>

255
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,638
rejection and accept this ratio so

256
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:34,769
what's the ratio<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these thousands of</font>

257
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">these thousand flights that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rejected</font>

258
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:43,470
falsely as being as being fake or

259
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,870
accepted faulty as being real<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

260
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:52,509
what we found is that if you observe the

261
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:55,689
aircraft for at least 14 seconds both

262
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:58,870
rates drop to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after 14</font>

263
00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:01,930
seconds we can perfectly say this flight

264
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:06,870
is real or this flight is<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid all right</font>

265
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:09,758
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pretty cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result</font>

266
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:13,420
because you can accomplish this with

267
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,850
without synchronization and specialized

268
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,300
hardware additional communication is

269
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:22,209
this a completely passive scheme which

270
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,969
brings me to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion that we have</font>

271
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:28,388
shown that against all intuitions you

272
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:30,670
can use the mobility to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

273
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:33,970
better to maintain a hundred percent

274
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,399
detection ratio of such attacks without

275
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,949
any synchronization as a completely

276
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,139
passive approach we did not put any

277
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:49,258
limitations on the adversary's knowledge

278
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:55,420
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no security by obscurity okay</font>

279
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:57,339
and in fact this solution does not only

280
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">work in the aviation scenario you can</font>

281
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:04,000
basically verify all moving objects such

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:07,300
as the cars<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a vehicular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network or</font>

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,540

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,269
location periodically there are still

286
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,290
some open questions for example we

287
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:26,250
assumed a stationary adversary so what

288
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,349
happens if the adversary is mobile

289
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,570
preliminary<font color="#E5E5E5"> results suggest that you can</font>

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,540
compensate this edition

295
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,240

in if other airplanes are verifying

298
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,040
airplanes then you have mobile Vera

299
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,600
files right and with these ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

300
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,030
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank you for your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attention and</font>

301
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:22,540
now I'm happy to take your questions

302
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:23,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks hi so you said you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

303
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,110
security through obscurity so the

304
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,210
attacker knows where all the base where

305
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,450
all the receiver stations are you I fly

306
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,430
home safely sorry yeah so the attacker

307
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,920
knows where all the receiver stations

308
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,170
are but I think your proof is assuming

309
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,310
the attacker is transmitting from one

310
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,630
point when the attacker just have five

311
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:47,349
directional transmitters and just send

312
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,880
the signal to different as all schemes

313
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,550
that rely on time of arrival

314
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,010
measurements we are also vulnerable to

315
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:59,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacks with a distributed attacker or</font>

316
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:03,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dolloff yahoo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> teka that can basically</font>

317
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:06,569
perfectly determine when does which

318
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:11,160
antenna receive which signal basically

319
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:13,750
yes so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still unsolved issue and</font>

320
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,699
that's a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I said of all</font>

321
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,569
schemes basically that rely on time of

322
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:23,589
arrival measurements as ours<font color="#CCCCCC"> does thank</font>

323
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:25,448
you in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides before you</font>

324
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,159
presented your schemes you had several

325
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,840
antennas and you had something based on

326
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">time difference of reliance ago but</font>

327
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,600
that's too expensive than the

328
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,209
exclusionary presented sounds to me like

329
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,550
this time difference over now so is it

330
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,170
too expensive or not I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I didn't</font>

331
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,080
the question it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the questions</font>

332
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,870
or it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeated all right in one</font>

333
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the slides before you presented your</font>

334
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,350
attack you had

335
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,480
several<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other people had</font>

336
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,320
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past decade which could not</font>

337
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,350
be done one of them was several and then

338
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,330
as it looked like oil rigs and you said

339
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,709
this one does time difference of arrival

340
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,389
but it costs too much because you have

341
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,830
to have a server on tennis then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

342
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,660
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that the solution you are</font>

343
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,350
proposing also does time difference of

344
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,300
airliners so what is the improvement the

345
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,429
improvement is that the antennas do not

346
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,590
have to be synchronized anymore like

347
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,630
what I said was that it's called

348
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,990
multilateration and therefore you need

349
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,700
really tightly synchronized antennas an

350
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,830
area of tightly synchronized antennas

351
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,880
and an hour scheme you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

352
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:32,159
every antenna can basically check this

353
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,160
equation independently of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the others</font>

354
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:43,540
my question is so your scheme relies on

355
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:47,350
the plane to have a very constant

356
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,200
broadcast rate right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> like in</font>

357
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,679
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems like AES which is used in</font>

358
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,470
ships the broadcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate varies with the</font>

359
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,270
maneuver that the ship<font color="#E5E5E5"> is currently</font>

360
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,210
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think there is even a</font>

361
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:05,680
random value to prevent repeated

362
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:08,920
collisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how does eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dsb</font>

363
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,770
deal with this and is is this rate

364
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">really so constant and so precise that</font>

365
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:20,110
you can measure these differences not

366
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:22,899
really but you can replace this constant

367
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,060
rate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stems contained in the</font>

368
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,670
messages so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end we just need to</font>

369
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,580
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's what's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time between the</font>

370
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,110
transmission of two messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

371
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,290
sender includes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp in the</font>

372
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,860
message you can determine it no matter

373
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:42,490
which rate the the sender is using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

374
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:48,399
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tsb there is a mode which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rarely</font>

375
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:52,690
implemented where messages are UTC

376
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,400
synchronized timed to certain times of

377
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:59,080
applicability that's what they call it

378
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can basically use this mode to</font>

379
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,320
to estimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the duration between the</font>

380
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,779
transmission of two messages how

381
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">accurate that is I don't know because</font>

382
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:13,299
there's maybe one out of thousand

383
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,039
transponders that supports this mode at

384
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:19,539
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> because eight is be still</font>

385
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:22,450
being rolled out but in theory it's

386
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:26,100
possible so the standard allows us to do

387
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,470
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the scheme is perfectly</font>

388
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,928
compliant with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard actually if</font>

389
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:34,960
the transmitters implement that accurate

390
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,909
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we either need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

391
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,970
the protocol and include the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp</font>

392
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:43,720
right or we need these transponders to

393
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,970
have this very accurate retransmission

394
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">time exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much so</font>

395
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,230
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should probably take future questions</font>

396
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,860
offline let's think of speaker<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and</font>

let's thank all the speakers
