1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so it's my pleasure to be here</font>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,280
to welcome you to this symposium on my

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,860
behalf on and on<font color="#CCCCCC"> vitali smarticles we</font>

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,579
have we were the program co-chairs for

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,139
this year I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just spend a few</font>

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,470
minutes telling you about how we came up

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,539
with this year's program so the

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,549
reviewing process we had four hundred

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,140
and two<font color="#E5E5E5"> papers submitted to the</font>

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,560
conference which is a the largest number

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever so far around zero the reviewing</font>

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,570
process consisted of mostly making sure

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the papers met the requirements</font>

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,000
laid out in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a call for papers and</font>

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,430
that that made us after<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero we</font>

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,489
had thrown out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of papers 386</font>

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,800
papers entered round one the 386 papers

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,260
were actually part of the real review

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,078
process and the first round of reviewing

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,699
each paper got two reviews so the goal

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,430
of the first round of reviewing was to

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,809
identify the papers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were actually</font>

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,730
reasonable likely candidates to be

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">included in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the final program so that we</font>

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,250
could focus the efforts on of the

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,100
program committee on those so this cut

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,820
down the number of papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were that</font>

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,850
we were focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to about half 195</font>

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,758
entered round two in round two each

30
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,520
paper got a few more a few more reviews

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,990
and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of round two we released</font>

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,539
the reviews to the authors and the

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">authors had a chance to respond to two</font>

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,210
reviews to point out factual errors and

35
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,679
so on and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know often we think as</font>

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,890
authors and I have certainly thought

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
this myself that there's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

38
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,340
perhaps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's very very little</font>

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,070
that actually happens is result of

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,110
author responses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year i can say</font>

41
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,419
that as a result<font color="#CCCCCC"> of author responses</font>

42
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">over 20 papers that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> initially set</font>

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,500
aside is probably not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic</font>

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,860
candidates for acceptance we revisited

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,189
after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responses and and got</font>

46
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,380
more reviews so these 216 papers that

47
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,229
were now still<font color="#CCCCCC"> in play went on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to round</font>

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,020
3 received more reviews and and these

49
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,289
round 3 culminated in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days of</font>

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,109
online online discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

51
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,599
online discussion we had a one and a

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,470
half day in person PC meeting in

53
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,840
Pittsburgh

54
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,230
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc meeting we again focus</font>

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,480
discussion on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted without</font>

56
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,850
discussion some small number of papers

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,989
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had uniformly excellent reviews and</font>

58
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,820
then we focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> the remainder of the</font>

59
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion on the papers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on which</font>

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,019
reviews were were more mixed and through

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,930
that discussion we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through we went</font>

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,300
through 94 papers to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,410
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 55 that you will see over the</font>

64
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,900
next three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives us an</font>

65
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,299
acceptance rate of thirteen point seven

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,030
thirteen point seven percent here's how

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,220
this compares to the last year's we had

68
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,340
about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent more papers</font>

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,650
submitted and we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept about</font>

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five percent more papers make</font>

71
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,070
more papers than last year's last year

72
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,260
the acceptance rate was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just over</font>

73
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,049
thirteen percent it's a tiny bit higher

74
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,420
still extremely competitive extremely

75
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,980
competitive this year just to give you a

76
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,309
sense for the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work that went</font>
