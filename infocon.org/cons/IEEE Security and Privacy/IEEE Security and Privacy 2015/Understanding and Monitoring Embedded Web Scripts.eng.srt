1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,730
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for the introduction</font>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,509
so this is joint work with my advisor

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,969
professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> David Evans so nowadays a lot</font>

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,320
of modern applications uses lots of

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,440
third-party components in their

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,289
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are functionalities</font>

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,380
include advertisements analytics and

8
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,349
some social network which is such as

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook or your Twitter feeds so these</font>

10
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,970
components are actually directly

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,130
embedded into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the page shown here</font>

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,250
because they need access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,600
count some of the content of the page

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other interesting fact here is that</font>

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,490
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sensitive information about the</font>

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,460
user could also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> displayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font>

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:47,690
page as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this includes maybe your</font>

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,360
username<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password your email address</font>

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,620
or some worst case maybe your financial

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">information depending on different sites</font>

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:00,199
so because these elements coexist

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,790
coexist together on the same page the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N</font>

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,860
trusted third-party component have

24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,710
access to all these sensitive

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,090
information and we can possibly

26
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,960
manipulate them or retrieve them and

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,750
send them my way to a remote party so

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,179
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript has some</font>

29
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:19,940
features such as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> evil or documented</font>

30
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,180
right makes this a very hard problem to

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,490
static<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I analyze what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the third</font>

32
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,680
party javascript is doing and also

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">because why we used compression and</font>

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,200
obfuscation it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard just to look</font>

35
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:37,220
at look into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript and</font>

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,590
determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they are doing basically</font>

37
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,010
the third-party scripts are doing so to

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,229
this end we<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose a script inspector</font>

39
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tool that as a set of tools</font>

40
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> help developers or concerned users</font>

41
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,089
to understand the behavior of

42
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,100
third-party<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript better so the</font>

43
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">centerpiece this tool is a modified</font>

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">Firefox browser which has a instrumented</font>

45
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,639
api's and they would intercept critical

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,430
calls to resources such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> storm cookies</font>

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,560
or network access and they would output

48
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,080
at risk which can be visualized by the

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,980
visualizer component the visualizer is

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,220
an extent

51
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,929
to the script script inspector and the

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,870
site administrators or the concerned

53
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,730
user can view the highlighted elements

54
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,000
of the page which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being accessed by</font>

55
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,768
the third-party JavaScript a<font color="#CCCCCC"> secondly</font>

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,410
use of script inspector is that it

57
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,660
supports a range of security policies

58
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,879
and these security policies can be used

59
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to in to monitor the third-party</font>

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,440
javascript in a script monitoring phase

61
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,670
and in the script monitoring face

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,579
screaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spector can take input from</font>

63
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,010
simulated sessions or reverse proxies so

64
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,470
this will be real word traffic and the

65
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,328
script inspector would rent the the

66
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,370
request and compare the current reacts

67
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:59,480
access with the predefined security

68
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,849
policy and they would raise some

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,260
violating accesses and to alarm the site

70
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:07,518
administrator if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is something</font>

71
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishy going on finally we also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed</font>

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,049
a policy generator that helps developers

73
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,510
to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these security policies</font>

74
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:19,700
because some of these policies could be

75
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,620
hard to to manually write and in this

76
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,888
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to focus on of its</font>

77
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,660
visualizer and the policy and due to

78
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">time constraints I will just briefly</font>

79
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,650
touch on the policy generator and if

80
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,319
you're interested you can go and read

81
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,930
the paper so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

82
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,760
visualizer first the visualizer is

83
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,849
actually best explained by using a video

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,709
so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see this is the</font>

85
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,260
interface for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the script inspector which</font>

86
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,489
is not very different from the Firefox

87
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,880
browser so basically here we'll use<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto</font>

88
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:56,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't calm as an example so here let's</font>

89
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,069
first visit autozone calm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> indeed in</font>

90
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this example I've already added two</font>

91
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,690
items to cart as you can see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

92
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,970
upper right<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner here I've already</font>

93
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,430
headed<font color="#CCCCCC"> two items and let's click on that</font>

94
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,280
and it will lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to the shopping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cart</font>

95
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,989
page and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see I have added these</font>

96
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,358
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> items and now now let's actually use</font>

97
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,239
the visualizer on the left side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

98
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,359
panel to see what surprise trip has

99
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:26,719
accessed so let's go ahead and do that

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,160
and it will display a list of domains

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,260
these aren't a third-party scripts that

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist on this page and let's focus on</font>

103
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,650
this script from money tape done that

104
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,600
and let's click the display off which

105
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,760
highlights all the resources on the page

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,750
that's been accessed by the script<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

107
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,900
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the part number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

108
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,510
the the items that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I added</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cart the</font>

109
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,219
quantity the price of it including the

110
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,390
total price of your card<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

111
00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessed by this particular script so as</font>

112
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:03,080
a third party or as a concerned user we

113
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,620
have no idea of whether this is actually

114
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,169
the intended behavior by audible com and

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,310
but this visualizer gives the user or

116
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,690
sign and measures<font color="#CCCCCC"> amateurs an idea of</font>

117
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,990
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the skirts</font>

118
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,930
third-party scripts so we're actually

119
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,730
also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to confirm that trips from</font>

120
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,910
magnet internet actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends this</font>

121
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:29,210
information away to money internet net

122
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,310
and this is captured by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fiddler the</font>

123
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,500
traffic capturing software so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

124
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,800
see the price and product ID and

125
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,500
quantity are being sent out so basically

126
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,290
this is how visualizer works and it

127
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,180
gives the sign it measures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

128
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,930
better idea of what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

129
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,820
page so moving out into<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

130
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,930
the security policy in that script

131
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,669
inspector supports the script inspector

132
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,000
must support a security policy that has

133
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,560
the these<font color="#E5E5E5"> several goals so basically the</font>

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">most important part is that the policy</font>

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,900
language needs to be very robust so this

136
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to avoid false alarms one the page</font>

137
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,120
content slightly changes or if there is

138
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:13,250
a new page being added to the site so

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,800
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> if ebay.com has a new item</font>

140
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,050
listed or New<font color="#CCCCCC"> York Times com have a new</font>

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,690
news page we don't want to redefine the

142
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,570
policy all the time and then it also

143
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:27,440
must be very accurate so that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

144
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,570
/ make the policy / promise permissive

145
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,090
so that it must follow the principle of

146
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,070
least privilege and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the</font>

147
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,469
policy should be expressive so that we

148
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,240
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the least amount of effort to</font>

149
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,260
create the most expressive policy to

150
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,890
minimize the developers effort

151
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,050
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look at a policy</font>

152
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,940
example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Analytics so this is</font>

153
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually all Google Analytics does</font>

154
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,700
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sites and all pages embedding</font>

155
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,280
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll explain the virtual entries</font>

156
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,580
in more detail but let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

157
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,789
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> / overview here so you can see</font>

158
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,820
that it reads certain part<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dom and right</font>

159
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:08,730
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head or body element and then</font>

160
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,940
access some navigator object properties

161
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:16,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a cookie and then network so</font>

162
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,540
let's focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one of these entries this</font>

163
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,670
particular permission allows Google

164
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,770
Analytics to read the client height

165
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,110
property of the body element so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

166
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,740
basically allowing analytics to read how

167
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,350
tall your document is the other

168
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,070
permissions shown here it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,230
analytic the google analytics can insert

170
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,480
in the head element but the argument

171
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,520
must be a script that<font color="#CCCCCC"> follows this</font>

172
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,070
regular expression so it cannot be an

173
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,630
inline script along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

174
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,920
permission this limits the domain or

175
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:54,570
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain where the script</font>

176
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,490
must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from so the this pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

177
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually works across all sites and all</font>

178
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,890
pages but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes there are cases</font>

179
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,820
where a policy cannot accurately

180
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:08,490
describe a BL top adopted to all the

181
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,280
pages and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because some pages</font>

182
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have advertisement were social</font>

185
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">slashdot.org would have advertisements</font>

186
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,599
on the top so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two banner ads</font>

187
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,510
there is a so-called sky stripper at

188
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">only right and then a different thing</font>

189
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,010
for ESPN where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have a square</font>

190
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,250
size dad displayed on right and then

191
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,200
they will have twitter twitter fees

192
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,809
below that different<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for</font>

193
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,310
Huffington Post<font color="#CCCCCC"> com so these as and</font>

194
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,550
social widgets are all embedded

195
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:47,869
differently so a policy would not work

196
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,280
across all the all the sites however

197
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,340
fortunately we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that</font>

198
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,120
with if we're looking just as pages

199
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,040
within once

200
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,680
right for example the upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three</font>

201
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">shots are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huffington post different news</font>

202
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,660
pages and the bottom two<font color="#CCCCCC"> are screenshots</font>

203
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,700
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slashed at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work so you</font>

204
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,410
can see that these layouts of

205
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,940
advertisement or social widgets they

206
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,260
actually follow a pretty consistent

207
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:16,320
pattern so basically because this

208
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,040
observation we're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose site</font>

209
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,260
specific policies so these policies only

210
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,810
apply to that side but all pages within

211
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,000
this site so the site specific policy is

212
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,939
used to augment the base policies when

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,450
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is an example of</font>

214
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Julia calm embedding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and services</font>

215
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:39,630
and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have certain</font>

216
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,360
policies about<font color="#E5E5E5"> inserting content into</font>

217
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,540
certain app placeholders so here they

218
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,480
have fate for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for placeholders and then</font>

219
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,760
it would also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read some location</font>

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,870
or size information about the ancestor

221
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,450
elements of that place odor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

222
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,100
let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the policy</font>

223
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,760
evaluation so how basically how

224
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,080
effective are the policies and what

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,040
effort the developers will need to make

226
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,880
to to write these policies so we took

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,279
the elected top a thousand websites and

228
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,070
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically crowd these websites and</font>

229
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,860
found 25 most lightly embedded scripts

230
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,080
and then we randomly selected the Henry

231
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,170
sites inside this top it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a thousand</font>

232
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,400
site that embeds at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

233
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">25 strips so this left us was basically</font>

234
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,079
a list of sites and a lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pages</font>

235
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:39,029
within the site so here we used a

236
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,910
crawler that range<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip inspector for a</font>

237
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,959
duration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty days and then whenever</font>

238
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,240
an alarm is raised this would be

239
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,219
inspected by me I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> acting as a site</font>

240
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,040
administrator for these the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Henry sites</font>

241
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,490
and then i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this a lot of</font>

242
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,870
this alarm is indeed intended behavior

243
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,820
acting as<font color="#CCCCCC"> this again their site</font>

244
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,339
administrator for example if there's an

245
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,260
ad showing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will add that to the</font>

246
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy and then i'll continue to run</font>

247
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:11,220
experiment so this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you an idea</font>

248
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:14,339
how many alarms has been issued<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

249
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,360
duration of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 days so on average we get</font>

250
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:20,100
about 450 requests for each site and the

251
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,720
red dot would mean that there is an

252
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,839
alarm issued by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the script inspector so</font>

253
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,880
if you're careful here so basically a

254
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,260
lot of the alarms are actually popping

255
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,660
up on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen</font>

256
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,510
meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first handed or so</font>

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">request you're going to see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

258
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:42,330
alarms and which requires me to add more

259
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:46,770
policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poll so</font>

260
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:48,540
statistically speaking if the we have

261
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,569
seen a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred request about the same</font>

262
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:55,800
site the problem there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually 71</font>

263
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,680
sites in the hundred that we will not

264
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,410
see any alarms issued in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Henry</font>

265
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,420
request so this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> number will go up</font>

266
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,240
as we see more requests so this is

267
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,729
basically describing how fast the policy

268
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,730
is converging to the complete behavior

269
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,869
there's also this list of august third

270
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,920
party domains that we've investigated

271
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:22,140
and actually if you look at the bottom

272
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">part here these chart beat and Google</font>

273
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">Analytics these are all analytics trips</font>

274
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,860
so they would require the<font color="#E5E5E5"> least amount</font>

275
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,689
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> size specific permissions we're only</font>

276
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,870
concerned about about site specific

277
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:37,350
permissions here because if a the base

278
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,150
policy for a force script it's basically

279
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,810
a one-time effort that doesn't need a

280
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,449
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sight and ministry an</font>

281
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,130
administrator effort but the site

282
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,800
specific permissions would need each

283
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:53,220
side to write their own so analytics

284
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,400
script they do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> require</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of site</font>

285
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific permissions whereas the google</font>

286
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,720
ads or advertisement scripts in general

287
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,490
the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> network which is because</font>

288
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're embedded in different ways they</font>

289
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,910
require many site specific permissions

290
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:11,490
but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general there are 72 sites out of</font>

291
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,890
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 that require at least one size</font>

292
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,860
specific permission and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

293
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,540
of permissions that we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 436 this</font>

294
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,240
averages out to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around six</font>

295
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,990
permissions per site so given that idea

296
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,020
actually

297
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,660
this is the CNBC com policy this

298
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,370
actually is exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> six permissions so</font>

299
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,360
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site administrators</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

300
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to write these policies when they</font>

301
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,380
want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the script inspector</font>

302
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:42,540
system so finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I conclude the</font>

303
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,089
we actually have the automatic policy

304
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,020
generator available this is to further

305
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:51,270
reduce the developers effort by

306
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,100
basically taking inputs from script

307
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,310
script inspector and then they will

308
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,100
propose the policy candidates and these

309
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,800
candidates can be visualized by the

310
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,170
visualizer again and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-team the</font>

311
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,199
developer can approve these policies

312
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:10,949
added these policies and add them to to

313
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,770
the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> poll but for due to time</font>

314
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,260
constraints I will be skipping this part

315
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:18,500
so again all the tools and policies are

316
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:22,410
available at squared inspector org

317
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:26,339
actually I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> show a video about the</font>

318
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">script the policy generator and i'll be</font>

319
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:38,160
taking questions during this video thank

320
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we have time for a few</font>

321
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:50,069
questions um so nice work I think you

322
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,930
know you can definitely draw some

323
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:56,100
comparisons between we've done here and

324
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,870
say frameworks like cfsp right<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

325
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,730
security policy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm wondering if you</font>

326
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">could maybe comment on you know what the</font>

327
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:05,970
connections are and where your approach

328
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is different sure so CSP at one point oh</font>

329
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:12,029
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still quite a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core screen</font>

330
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:15,270
policy that basically enables the<font color="#CCCCCC"> white</font>

331
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">list of scripts or whatnot and 1.1 of</font>

332
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:22,620
course would have some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine-grained</font>

333
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:25,770
policy control but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that we</font>

334
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,570
provide all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these policy languages that</font>

335
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:30,029
like you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> regular expressions</font>

336
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,430
inside the CSS selectors that can

337
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:36,240
accurately describe what the app place

338
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:38,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">holders are and those I think it's will</font>

339
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,430
be helping the CSP CSP would not have

340
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,160
that capability and as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as our</font>

341
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:47,160
policy generator which helps developers

342
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,949
generate the policies and that is also

343
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,779
important to I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> compliment the CSP</font>

344
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:57,390
as well so but the implementation of

345
00:15:53,779 --> 00:16:00,600
like intercepting the API calls as far

346
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,430
as that goes i think CSP<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my</font>

347
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementations are like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complementary</font>

348
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:10,620
to each other yes so your policy

349
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:14,610
generator as i understand it examines

350
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:18,600
the accesses made during typical runs

351
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:21,449
and generates list of accesses but what

352
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">if sort of a more complex series of</font>

353
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:29,250
events are needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know bring out</font>

354
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:32,690
accesses that are not typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

355
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:36,570
so so that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good question so the</font>

356
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically about it maybe the</font>

357
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,579
requires of mouse clicks or like other

358
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,399
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> events to see all the behaviors so</font>

359
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:47,229
in the so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evaluation that we did</font>

360
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,440
we try to reuse the<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

361
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,690
random clicks or like we attempted to do

362
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's no guarantee that we</font>

363
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,670
actually discovered all the behavior so

364
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,850
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see more</font>

365
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests or maybe we do more fuzzing on</font>

366
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,140
the on the simulated sessions but I

367
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,970
guess you're right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's generally a very</font>

368
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,740
hard problem to ensure that we've seen

369
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,930
all the behavior so where I was going

370
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:16,390
with the question is so what role<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

371
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:18,670
see your tool playing in someone trying

372
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,800
to understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> integration of</font>

373
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party sites in third-party scripts</font>

374
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,869
in their side do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you will</font>

375
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,840
replace all existing analysis tools

376
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:32,020
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis tools or is it more of</font>

377
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,790
an interface tool so I am somewhat

378
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:41,110
unsure where in the space of mechanisms

379
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:44,290
that illicit behavior yes your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pool fits</font>

380
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,149
you know yes so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I wouldn't</font>

381
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,620
say it's replacing the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis</font>

382
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,330
tool but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> stag analysis on</font>

383
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,870
javascript is generally a hard problem

384
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:56,169
but um so this tool is more like dynamic

385
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">so because you ran the sign actually you</font>

386
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,010
actually go to that side and execute

387
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,780
everything on that so but this would of

388
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,240
course have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code coverage problem</font>

389
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you only see one one execution</font>

390
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,640
so I thought I wouldn't say it replaces

391
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> static analysis tool but they</font>

392
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,080
probably can work together and to better

393
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,780
help the developers make their decision

394
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:23,590
so thank you thank you for the question

395
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:26,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay one more question okay my question</font>

396
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">was about what if these third-party</font>

397
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,750
scripts actually change after the

398
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,690
administrator have inspected them right

399
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,520
so that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question this</font>

400
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,640
the work the purpose of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world</font>

401
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,430
actually is to monitor the change of

402
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,650
this third-party<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript because they</font>

403
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,630
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be compromised by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a malicious</font>

404
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,230
attacker and then we do something

405
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious so in that sense this would</font>

406
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,180
actually catch the policy would actually

407
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,730
catch the attack behavior but if they

408
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,740
are just changing for example the Google

409
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,340
Analytics me updated version and

410
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:07,600
then in June hours 40 days of experiment

411
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:10,928
we actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not see any other than</font>

412
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,020
site updating themselves we didn't see

413
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:17,620
actually behavior changes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the major</font>

414
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,750
scripts they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be changing like the</font>

415
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,928
detailed implementation slightly but

416
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,179
it's not affecting the API calls that we

417
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:27,809
intercept so the policy will still work

418
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:30,520
for that new version but in fact if they

419
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:33,010
do a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> overhaul like completely</font>

420
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the version I to update to a</font>

421
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:38,170
complete new version then a policy might

422
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:41,080
break and the certain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assignment and</font>

423
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message may have to retrain the the</font>

424
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,800
policy so but we don't expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

425
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen very often okay let's think the</font>

426
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,428
speaker one more time
