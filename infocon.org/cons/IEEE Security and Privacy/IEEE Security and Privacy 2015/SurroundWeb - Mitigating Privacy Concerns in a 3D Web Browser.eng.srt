1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
and this is work joint work with my

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,240
colleagues at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft Research some of</font>

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,300
whom are no longer at Microsoft Research

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,190
so this talk is about surround web a 3d

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,010
web browser that brings immersive

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,509
experiences to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web web designs</font>

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,550
surround with explicitly to make these

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,010
experiences possible while mitigating

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,260
important privacy concerns inherent to

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,359
these experiences but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I can</font>

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain surround web let me show you</font>

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,450
what immersive experiences actually are

13
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,000
so I'm beginning this presentation with

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,460
a brief video about microsoft hololens

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,290
as it illustrates a new way to render

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,690
applications that we call immersive

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,480
experiences immersive experience is

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,820
mixed digital and real-world objects to

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,860
create rich computing experiences the

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,600
applications can display content that

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,250
responds intelligently to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user's</font>

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,039
physical environment and can be

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,710
interacted with in natural ways for

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">example in the video the modeling</font>

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,660
software intelligently overlays digital

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,299
content over an actual motorcycle and

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,810
allows the user to modify the model in a

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,790
natural manner similarly this user is in

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,460
a skype video chat and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video chat</font>

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,619
follows her around and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> this user</font>

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,658
is playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Minecraft and you can see</font>

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the digital blocks intelligently</font>

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,340
overlay physical surfaces and you can

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,470
modify the digital village with<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,750
hands and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video goes on to show</font>

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,840
other experiences and scenarios where

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">digital and physical contents content</font>

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,880
interact and intersect so now imagine

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">that hollow lens has an immersive web</font>

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
browser that lets web pages display

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,780
content in the room much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,449
applications you saw in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video this</font>

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,920
is not such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy leap smartphone web</font>

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,110
browsers<font color="#CCCCCC"> have grown in maturity to</font>

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">encapsulate many of the features</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,509
native applications enjoy including

47
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:02,700
camera access vibration control and

48
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:04,350
device orientation events so I believe

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> platforms like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hollow lens will</font>

50
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,959
eventually see an immersive web browser

51
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,819
the thing is hollow lens is not yet

52
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,640
released and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it clear</font>

53
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like John's</font>

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,649
here I know nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about hololens I</font>

55
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,569
have never<font color="#CCCCCC"> used one never developed for</font>

56
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,130
one or seen one in person so please

57
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,679
don't take anything I've said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

58
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,500
talk as an indication of hollow lenses

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,720
capabilities or limitations instead

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,700
during this talk I'll be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

61
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,890
an immersive web browser in the context

62
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,869
of a single room equipped with

63
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,970
projectors displays and connects all

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,250
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in harmony to produce an</font>

65
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,400
immersive experience so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">setting in which surround web operates</font>

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,050
in the paper we consider a wide range of

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,480
immersive experiences and scenarios that

69
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,340
can be supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> using surround web but</font>

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,679
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk I'm going to focus on a</font>

71
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,330
single karaoke application to illustrate

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,330
the privacy challenges associated with

73
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,830
these experiences so immersive karaoke

74
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the web might sound a bit far-fetched</font>

75
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,320
at first but so does real-time video

76
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,480
chat that uses facial recognition to

77
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,489
intelligently superimpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> mustaches and</font>

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,709
birthday hats on people and that already

79
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,780
exists in google hangouts which by the

80
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,750
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to mention now works without</font>

81
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,850
any plugins whatsoever so the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

82
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,100
long been a vehicle for novel

83
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,890
experiences so immersive<font color="#CCCCCC"> carioca isn't</font>

84
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,540
out of the question returning to our

85
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,040
room what's launched this karaoke web

86
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,780
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> after selecting a song the</font>

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,700
web page displays a music video on the

88
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">TV's such as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Queen frontman</font>

89
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,420
Freddie Mercury it'll put the lyrics on

90
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,920
the wall using projection mapping and

91
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,290
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a ceiling-mounted projector</font>

92
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,390
the web page will display a playlist on

93
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the table that supports interactions via</font>

94
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,850
connect gestures and then maybe it'll

95
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,030
project some crowd shots on the wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

96
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,650
cheer you on and maybe if you had some

97
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,329
snacks in the room it can supply you

98
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,400
with nutrition information so you can

99
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,010
make informative karaoke time snack

100
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,030
choices and all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

101
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:10,880
but to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this work this immersive</font>

102
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,190
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok web page running in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new web</font>

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,170
browser needs to somehow orchestrate

104
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,048
multiple display devices and sensors

105
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,060
together in concert how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

106
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:23,299
while maintaining some level of user

107
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,849
privacy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine just simply</font>

108
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,500
granting the page<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to all these</font>

109
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,599
sensors and display devices through job

110
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,180
script but this poses serious privacy

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,980
concerns as these rich sensor streams

112
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,010
can contain sensitive incidental data

113
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,140
such as that embarrassing i love PHP mug

114
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,750
you securely own or the label on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

115
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,150
prescription drugs you have in the room

116
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,130
as a next step you could imagine

117
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,229
filtering the sensor stream to remove

118
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,350
sensitive incidental data but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

119
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,240
issues here as well first the care<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

120
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,850
page must construct its own rendering

121
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,160
support atop this data preventing

122
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,620
interoperability with existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI and</font>

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,390
Dom API s and second if a web

124
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,130
application wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support natural</font>

125
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,409
user interactions like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> playlist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

126
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,270
we showed it will need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track the</font>

127
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,580
user's movements from the sensor stream

128
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,169
to detect those gestures which would

129
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,900
reveal other information<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the user's</font>

130
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:17,299
height the location<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe the users wait</font>

131
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,400
in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's a clear</font>

132
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,120
tension here between functionality and

133
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,609
privacy so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> give immersive web</font>

134
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,530
pages the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to detect gestures and</font>

135
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,290
render content intelligently while

136
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintaining some notion of user privacy</font>

137
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,460
our answer was a set of new abstractions

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,260
which we implemented in a 3d web browser

139
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,120
like I said called surround web and

140
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,570
these abstractions are a core

141
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,190
contribution of this work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we</font>

142
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,979
designed those we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer a</font>

143
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,450
related question what our users privacy

144
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,640
attitudes anyway in this type of

145
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,690
environment and going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this work we</font>

146
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,550
didn't know so we turn to user surveys

147
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,830
we deployed an online survey using the

148
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,390
instantly service<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 50 people and we</font>

149
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to understand their privacy</font>

150
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,200
attitudes in a variety of scenarios so

151
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:06,409

156
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,590

sharing with three different

158
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,419

181
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,699
attitudes toward different applications

182
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,379
so for example many survey participants

183
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,110
were willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to release more information</font>

184
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,699
to the 911 application because they were

185
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,090
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with emergency personnel</font>

186
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,590
having access to it but they also

187
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,020
thought creatively about how other

188
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,729
programs could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the information so</font>

189
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,460
for example the movie player that I

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:35,930
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> they thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font>

191
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,609
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cool idea or one person thought it</font>

192
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,770
would be a really cool idea if it used

193
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,409
your head position to migrate content

194
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,659
closer to you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and these</font>

195
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:46,099
results suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an immersive web</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">large flat surfaces in the room which</font>

200

you saw highlighted to be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensitive</font>

201

216
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,198
means that an application can customize

217
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,419
its layout based on the presence of an

218

object in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the application</font>

219
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,838
never learns whether the object is

to the screen information this is the

<font color="#CCCCCC">resolution display and so the karaoke</font>

301
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,689
application can simply use the screens

302
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,700
location information in the room to

303
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">determine an appropriate location so</font>

304
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,810
it'll put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this orange one above</font>

305
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the TV the interactive play wish should</font>

306
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,650
go on some surface that<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports input</font>

307
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,270
events the karaoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page can query</font>

308
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,439
the room skeleton<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see which screen</font>

309
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:12,510
supports input events and of the screens

310
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,340
in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the table is in range</font>

311
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,110
of the Kinect sensor for gesture

312
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,340
recognition which surround<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode will</font>

313
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,860
translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> into standard Mouse events</font>

314
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,340
thus the karaoke application will simply

315
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,990
place the interactive playlist there and

316
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,700
then finally for the remaining screens

317
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,080
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not issued content to it can just</font>

318
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,610
put crowd shots up there so since the

319
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">room skeleton is high level and</font>

integrates with the Dom the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">described so far is pretty minimal and</font>

323
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,450

324
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,290
it actually looks like running in the

325
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:49,440
prototype but we aren't forgetting about

326
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,839
one thing what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that snack calorie</font>

327
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,240
counter the<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage needs to know when</font>

329
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,390
without knowing if the snacks are there

330
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:03,450
at all that's where the detection

331
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:06,090
sandbox comes in the detection sandbox

332
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,500
lets applications place content relative

something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I i do recommend</font>

355

that you take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the paper for</font>

further details on side channel

the calorie information will

360
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,870
appropriately appear below the coke can

361
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:18,560
in the room and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the prototype</font>

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:20,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is what it looks like so to briefly</font>

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,180
recap all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I presented surround web</font>

privacy concerns surround web augments

abstractions that integrate into HTML

369
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,660
and CSS and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly recommend that you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">read the paper just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as it contains many</font>

and further information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy</font>

questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start a silent video</font>

that shows off the prototype in action

<font color="#CCCCCC">we consider in the paper thank you all</font>

380
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:08,209
does anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any questions</font>

381
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:10,970
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> surround web I ok so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

382
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:13,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple so da did you consider any other</font>

383
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,339
test applications relatively deeply

384
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,110
besides the karaoke one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much</font>

385
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,180
all the ones that we listed in a table

386
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,070
in the in the paper we thought through

387
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,880
all of them and what would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> required</font>

388
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,810
to to like create them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in surround web</font>

389
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,939
so pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much if you look at all of</font>

390
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,349
those we thought them through even

391
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,000
though we didn't have space in the paper

392
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,920
to explicitly discuss every single one

393
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,250
of them didn't give us a highlight reel

394
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,260
of what those are let's see there was

395
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">one I forget if it made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the paper</font>

396
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,060
there's one that's mention in this video

397
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:47,089
that in a kitchen would display recipe

398
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:50,029
information I'm like a bias stove and

399
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:51,500
would warn you if burners were hot or

400
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,189
stuff like that using the detection

401
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,459
sandbox by detecting that information

402
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,709
cool so did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he did a survey</font>

403
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:02,589
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users did you verify that they</font>

404
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:05,380
understood this new

405
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,330
abstraction so in the survey for every

406
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,790
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that they gave we asked</font>

407
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,380
them why they asked them to justify

408
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,510
their answer and I look through all of

409
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,860
them to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they roughly</font>

410
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,319
understood what we wanted them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

411
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,880
understand for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part most of</font>

412
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,620
them understood it but naturally there

413
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,130
were some people who were confused oh

414
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,280
cool cool and then so I have one final

415
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:30,070
question so I really like the detection

416
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,420
privacy abstraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I feel like</font>

417
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're probably would be some</font>

418
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,760
compelling use cases that would be

419
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,110
prevented by that were there anything

420
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,760
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but like oh</font>

421
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,530
absolutely action privacy just will

422
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,610
prevent it from happening yeah so we

423
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,870
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for the sort of</font>

424
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,120
abstractions that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just give to</font>

425
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,130
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page for the most part people be</font>

426
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,170
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it but as a result yeah</font>

427
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,820
we naturally do limit the range of

428
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,829
applications and types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences</font>

429
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can support so yeah in the</font>

430
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,250
future it would be great to allow stuff

431
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,230
in the detection sandbox that supports

432
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,410
interactions may be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trusted</font>

433
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:06,339
intermediary or something like that but

434
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,659
at the moment we don't have anything for

435
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,579
that right now cool thanks we have a

436
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">question the center Mike yeah in general</font>

437
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:20,109
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that if it were possible to</font>

438
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre place huge volumes of data which</font>

439
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:26,139
doesn't seem absolutely impossible the

440
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,209
way we're going would that mitigate most

441
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,420
of the problems if you actually didn't

442
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:33,370
have to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> web accesses to to find out</font>

443
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,600
most of this information it were just

444
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:41,590
pre placed on your devices what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>
