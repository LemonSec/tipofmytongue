1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,649
so I'm Ryan I'm going to talk today

2
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:08,410
about a new kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> denial service</font>

3
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacked that we conceived prototype and</font>

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,210
implemented a bit at UC Berkeley and

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,010
this is joint work with three great

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,580
collaborators their local Murthy Nick

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,560
Weaver and burn pacsun<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's</font>

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,288
start out here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be an</font>

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,240
attack paper and what we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:28,000
to do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is come up with a new kind of</font>

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,439
flooding based analysis attack and the

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">question you're probably asking is okay</font>

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,280
well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is old you know we already</font>

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> get us we already have</font>

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,499
amplification right is it really

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,409
anything new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in this space right</font>

17
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:44,589
that that's that's somewhat practical

18
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:46,839
and so what we're going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is</font>

19
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:48,248
yes there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually using</font>

20
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,530
something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> importa lensing which</font>

21
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:52,149
we develop here we can take a low

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,549
bandwidth flood from an attacker and

23
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:58,329
change the packet arrival times at the

24
00:00:54,549 --> 00:01:00,699
victim so that this the slow flow this

25
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:04,960
low flood turns into a short but large

26
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:07,060
pulse and this kind of pulsing has been

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,699
this kind of pulsing attack the actual

28
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,360
pulses itself have been explored in

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,310
previous works on and they can target

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCPS retransmitted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time out and additive</font>

31
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,149
increase multiplicative decrease

32
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,880
mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> as have been explored and</font>

33
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:23,590
true and pulsing papers right but the

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,359
the novelty here is that we're able to

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,420
use the entire attacker bandwidth and

36
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,270
kind of funnel it up into a short pause

37
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,979
right and so the question is how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

38
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,658
going to do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for inspiration</font>

39
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:37,479
we're going to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to World War two</font>

40
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:41,710
right and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> World War two there was</font>

41
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,950
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know this problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

42
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,359
the Allies where they had limited

43
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,850
artillery limited shell and capacity and

44
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,829
they really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of do the</font>

45
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">most impact for the ammunition that they</font>

46
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,380
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what they did is they came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

47
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:56,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this technique called time on</font>

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,420
target where multiple artillery what

49
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,949
coordinate their sending times so that

50
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,759
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their attack traffic landed on</font>

51
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,539
the victim in a short<font color="#E5E5E5"> bursts and a newer</font>

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,370
and more advanced kind of technique that

53
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:10,750
the borrows from time on target is

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,990
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> rounds simultaneous</font>

55
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:17,050
simultaneous impact and this is where as

56
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:22,090
artillery by<font color="#CCCCCC"> varying the trajectory and</font>

57
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the charge of its I was firing can can</font>

58
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,010
fire multiple rounds I have all these

59
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:33,670
rounds rendezvous on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim and one</font>

60
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:36,480
burst right so for our actual attack our

61
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,940
goal here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to take the top graph and</font>

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,010
somehow use a network and get that

63
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,960
bottom graph at the victim right so

64
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,649
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a low overall rate</font>

65
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:53,230
and get a pulse of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim and we're</font>

66
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,420
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this you know this attack</font>

67
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,700
you it is kind of like so we call it

68
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">lensing because we're going to</font>

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">concentrate traffic and in focus I'd</font>

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,330
like like a lens focuses light and this

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,460
attack is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be with orthogonal to</font>

72
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,720
but also compatible with amplification

73
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,340
and so to actually to actually leverage

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,380
it right we need multiple agencies and

75
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,580
paths for an attacker to send to right

76
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,590
and so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that by using</font>

77
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflectors right and and so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

78
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,000
very contrived example of how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

79
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,950
work so what we have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,310
essentially three reflectors in the

81
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,049
network and each one gives the victim

82
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,850
and a different attack path latency

83
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,350
essentially a different path time

84
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,590
through the reflector to the victim

85
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,420
right so r1 r2 and r3 have path times

86
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,120
are three two and one second

87
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,530
respectively right so if the attacker

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,900
only sends to the right of one packet or

89
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:51,610
second right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let start this off</font>

90
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,040
right that at time zero they talk about

91
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,110
sent to r1 right and since the path time

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,780
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> three seconds this packet will</font>

93
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,190
arrive at time three and so this package

94
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,230
travels through the network and that

95
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,710
time one the attacker will send towards

96
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,829
r2 and since this path time is it is two

97
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,450
seconds right this packet will also

98
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,290
rendezvous with the victim at at time

99
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,519
three right and then at time two we do

100
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,709
the same thing with the third reflector

101
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,910
and that also will rendezvous at time

102
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,640
three the victim so what we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

103
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,610
is we sent at a rate of only one packet

104
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,169
for a second but we see that at the

105
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,370
victim we're able to concentrate this

106
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:36,130
traffic into a short

107
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:40,150
pulse of three packets per second and so

108
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,010
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is now that we can you</font>

109
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,630
know we have this theoretical intuition

110
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,820
of how this works how can we actually

111
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">conduct a lensing attack right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,990
there's two main steps the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

113
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,599
obtaining these these paths time or

114
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,570
attack pathway to estimates which is the

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,990
essentially the time through roof

116
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a reflector to the victim and</font>

117
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,479
doing this on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

118
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,310
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is given these estimates</font>

119
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,530
how do we optimize<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of the pulse</font>

120
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:15,699
right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we make that pulse I guess</font>

121
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,500
as tall as<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible and for our</font>

122
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,289
prototype we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to limit it to DNS</font>

123
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,940
in the sense that so first of all what

124
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,159
that will let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do is we can use DNS</font>

125
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,650
recursion to enable reflection instead

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,370
of having to use source source IP

127
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,049
spoofing and it also lets us get better

128
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,720
latency estimations as well show on the

129
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,720
next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

130
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,730
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first problem here is how do we</font>

131
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,380
estimate you know these attack pathol

132
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,230
agencies how can we find that the

133
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,550
latency through a reflector to the

134
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,840
victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what we're going to do is</font>

135
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,500
we're going to leverage something called

136
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">King which was which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a prior work</font>

137
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,690
used to essentially measure Layton sees

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
between arbitrary and host in the

139
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,280
network and so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take King and over</font>

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,560
late with the actors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and our attack here</font>

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">in red right we get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice one to</font>

142
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,430
one mapping and essentially the way that

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,680
we can make these<font color="#E5E5E5"> measurements right so</font>

144
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,590
the reflector will be an open dns server

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,570
and the victim will be a dns name server

146
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,419
here authoritative for the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> food</font>

147
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">out bar right and so the attacker</font>

148
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,670
essentially does is step one is send a

149
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,420
request for a sub domain of food bar

150
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,990
here XYZ the the resolver gets this

151
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,910
request and it doesn't know the answer

152
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it forwards it to the authoritative</font>

153
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,980
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> food bar which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the victim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

154
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,150
victim knows the answer gives reply back

155
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,880
and the reflector which is an open dns

156
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,890
resolver affords<font color="#CCCCCC"> that reply back to the</font>

157
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,180
attacker right and so by taking the time

158
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,620
difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter</font>

159
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,610
was sent and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when the last</font>

160
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,820
response was was received the attacker

161
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:03,030
now has an estimate for this attack path

162
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">round-trip time and can can have that to</font>

163
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,710
get an estimate for the attack path wait

164
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see right so now with these attack</font>

165
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:14,400
path you know estimates there's a

166
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">question of how does the set how is the</font>

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,010
attacker build an optimal schedule in a

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:26,790
sense that of making the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

169
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:27,930
the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulse possible and so what</font>

170
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,550
we're going to do first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're going</font>

171
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,220
to choose a target pulse window which is

172
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,660
the duration<font color="#CCCCCC"> and offset of one we want</font>

173
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,590
the actual spike to land at the victim

174
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we ask the question so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

175
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,250
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> slot the sender has or the attacker</font>

176
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,320
has to send which reflector should the

177
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,240
attacker choose and it turns out that

178
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,169
the the greedy answer is the right

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,910
answer essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose the the</font>

180
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,190
reflective that if we send at this given

181
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,150
time it

182
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,980
have the highest probability of

183
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,849
balancing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that packet into the pulse</font>

184
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,990
window and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is greedy but we've</font>

185
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,850
shown the paper that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is in fact</font>

186
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimal right so for our actual</font>

187
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,050
prototype set up what we've done here is

188
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:14,150
on the on the west coast we have an as

189
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:17,710
your vm and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> east coast in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon</font>

190
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:20,900
as your vm that will act as our victims

191
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,820
our reflectors are open dns resolvers

192
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,020
that we obtained from an open less

193
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,790
online and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not under our</font>

194
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,229
control right and the thing to note here

195
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,730
is where we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to das or own</font>

196
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,800
servers that are under our control and

197
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,000
we're also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throttle load to any</font>

198
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,189
of these reflectors so we're not going

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do any harm I guess in our</font>

200
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,430
experiments so before we actually get

201
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the results we want to ask the question</font>

202
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,449
you know how can we really determine how

203
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,819
effective lensing is and so we came up

204
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,100
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two metrics here the first is the</font>

205
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,190
bandwidth gain and it it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

206
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:59,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much bank an attack</font>

207
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,310
would get froze buck right so and we did

208
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,600
we determine this by taking the

209
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,699
bandwidth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pulse that then</font>

210
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,590
attacker creates to the attackers don't

211
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,510
upload bandwidth and so for example um

212
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,230
you know talking would want a higher

213
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,390
bandwidth can the second is a

214
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,950
concentration efficiency which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

215
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,260
somewhat similar and it's essentially a

216
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,030
measure of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proportion of packets</font>

217
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,770
that an attacker sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

218
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,459
land in the pulse and will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be</font>

219
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:29,600
effective for the attack so these

220
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,010
measures might seem you know duels of

221
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,910
one another but actually they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

222
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,130
little bit different and to illustrate

223
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,380
that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if an attacker sent</font>

224
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,089
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one packet and it landed in the</font>

225
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,250
window the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be that the</font>

226
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,480
smallest possible game possible 1x but

227
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,800
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an efficiency of a hundred</font>

228
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,589
percent because every packet attacker

229
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,760
sent landed in the window<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so to</font>

230
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,690
illustrate this with an actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

231
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:54,530
here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an actual pulse that we</font>

232
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:56,839
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm targeting the Amazon victim</font>

233
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,000
right and so the first thing to note

234
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,530
here is right the bottom graph what you

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,209
see is this is the sending traffic from

236
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attacker</font>

237
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:09,589
and and on the bottom what we have is

238
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,149
the arrival<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the victim and so</font>

239
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,480
you notice here that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

240
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:18,970
create this pulsing we can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

241
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,689
lensing to create pulses right and so

242
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,009
the the quick eyeball way to kind of

243
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,599
calculate these metrics right the

244
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:28,069
bandwidth gain can simply be calculated

245
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,920
by taking the height<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pulse bucket</font>

246
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:33,319
and dividing that but by the tallest

247
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,469
height of the sending buckets on the top

248
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,998
and the efficiency is simply the area of

249
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,459
the pulse bucket divided by the sum of

250
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:46,550
the area of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack of the attacker</font>

251
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:47,540
buckets in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top graph right so now</font>

252
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,290
that we know we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

253
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,910
these pulses we want to measure kind of

254
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,410
how do these pulses change as a factor

255
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,889
of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two big things the first is</font>

256
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,610
the attacker bandwidth so as we emulate

257
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,129
attackers with different upload

258
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,009
bandwidth can we still create this

259
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:07,490
lensing effect or does it scale poorly

260
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:09,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second question is you know how</font>

261
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,860
narrow or wide can we create these these

262
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:16,220
pulses and so to enter the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

263
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,449
question what we did is essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

264
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,410
our two metrics which are on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y-axis</font>

265
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:22,790
and we measured them against the

266
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,170
attacker and maximum bandwidth so we

267
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,439
artificially throttled the bandwidth

268
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,269
that the attacker would send that and so

269
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:33,110
what we see is for me loading medium

270
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:34,790
bandwidth it seems to scale well right

271
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:40,279
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a relatively constant efficiency</font>

272
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:43,040
and constant bandwidth gain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

273
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,350
that at you know I talked with band

274
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,748
widths of 10,000 packets per second and

275
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,269
higher we see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop-off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

276
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:52,369
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's his drop-off a</font>

277
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,230
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of poor scaling or is it perhaps</font>

278
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:57,199
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the attack actually</font>

279
00:11:54,230 --> 00:12:02,209
working and overwhelming the victim so

280
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:03,889
what we did was we we measured the

281
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,498
actual download capacity of the site by

282
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,420
flooding it with an actual flood and we

283
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:12,429
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it could only take a take a</font>

284
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,429
maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 16,000 packets per second</font>

285
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,389
and then we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we as we measure the</font>

286
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,008
actual peak band of the pulse oh not

287
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:23,220
that relative bandwidth gain but the

288
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:24,690
actual you know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we</font>

289
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,440
make these pulses and that's what's on

290
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,689
the y-axis here and what we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

291
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,980
that it also levels out at around 60,000

292
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:38,279
packets per second so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really this</font>

293
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,839
kind of poor scaling at you know attack

294
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,269
of the band once of 10 10 plus thousand

295
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,790
packets per second that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only poor</font>

296
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,639
scaling at all what it is is just we're

297
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,779
overhauling the victim and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our mattress</font>

298
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:57,899
the magics fall off because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that ok</font>

299
00:12:51,779 --> 00:13:02,160
so now right so now like satisfied with

300
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:04,139
kind of our prototype we move on to kind

301
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a few extensions of how how to make</font>

302
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:10,110
the attack practical fully operational

303
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:13,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps how to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

304
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,350
the first extension might be you know it

305
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,060
it's a real biggie how can we attack non

306
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,800
DNS house right so if you remember in a

307
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:25,949
prototype what we had was essentially we

308
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:31,410
limited the did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> victim to an</font>

309
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:34,109
authoritative dns name server and so but

310
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,300
for a real attacker will want to talk in

311
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,089
any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> host and so there's a few</font>

312
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">tricks that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play to do that we</font>

313
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:43,709
can manipulate<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS records to make the</font>

314
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:46,500
victim appear as an authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

315
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:49,109
server we can also find<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns servers</font>

316
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,930
located close to the victim take<font color="#E5E5E5"> latency</font>

317
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,740
measurements to that host and then for

318
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,819
the actual attack target the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

319
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,949
next extension would be to combine

320
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,490
lensing with application and this could

321
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:03,990
be potentially troublesome for a victim

322
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,019
right because an amplification factor

323
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,059
say a 15 and bandwidth gain of 10 this

324
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,040
would let an attacker create pulses that

325
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be you know 150 times greater than</font>

326
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,420
its own upload bandwidth there's also

327
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,459
the question can we distribute attacks

328
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,759
in the sense of can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have multiple</font>

329
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,250
attackers each create lensing and have

330
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,510
all of their pulses add up at the victim

331
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:32,130
and so what we found is because this

332
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:35,310
actually requires this actually requires

333
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,780
coordination of time soon time

334
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,099
synchronization between these hackers

335
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:44,250
and that what we use was ntp and it was

336
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not fine grained enough to create small</font>

337
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,680
pulses so we had to we had to

338
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,600
essentially make the window size<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

339
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,140
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit bigger than than usual to</font>

340
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:00,620
accommodate this kind of times<font color="#CCCCCC"> q between</font>

341
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:03,210
attackers there's also the question of

342
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,730
somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> increasing the bandwidth gain</font>

343
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,350
right and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are various</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

344
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,360
waste one in the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> of perhaps ways</font>

345
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,000
to increase it increase the attack path

346
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,020
latency right perhaps you know find lot

347
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,430
longer paths on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet essentially</font>

348
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,439
providing more time for an attacker to

349
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,020
funnel up as bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> into into the</font>

350
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,850
pulse there's also like a cool thing

351
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,220
that we noted essentially with

352
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,980
retransmits and so here essentially what

353
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,540
happens is because the reflectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

354
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS resolvers and at higher bandwidth</font>

355
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,230
essentially what happens is the victim

356
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,240
cannot keep up and so the victim it is

357
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,950
an authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server and it can</font>

358
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,800
keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the queries that there is</font>

359
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,440
all about as query yet and so some of

360
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,000
the queries are actually dropped and so

361
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,580
some of the resolve voters will time out

362
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,670
and then resend and that's what you see

363
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the bottom graph these auxiliary</font>

364
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,530

365
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,650

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,500
and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the timeouts are usually</font>

like point eight and two seconds you'll

369
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:16,820
see these spikes it point eight in two

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> auntie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defenses here so</font>

372
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,790
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two main sides of</font>

373
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,680
Defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first is defending against</font>

the reconnaissance portion the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> King</font>

375
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,209
style with latency estimations<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

376
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,209
so on a defender might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

377
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">or pause in these estimations but but</font>

378
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:41,439
even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defender did there's still</font>

379
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,350
no story for an attacker finding a code

380
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,339
like a co-located server to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> victim</font>

381
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:51,040
and obtaining measurements to it so for

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,769
defending against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual attack so</font>

383
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,149
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shrew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and pulsing side</font>

384
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:57,930
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been prior work on</font>

strengthening<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP either through</font>

387
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,240
buffer sizes things like that our

388
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,919
contribution here was perhaps routers

389
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,990
could add an artificial amount of jitter

390
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,169
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets as their scent and this</font>

391
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,390
would essentially spread out the pulse

392
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,790
that's created through lensing and

393
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,429
that's all obviously no go for regular

394
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,928
traffic but we do note that multipathing

395
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:32,500
actually has a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar property</font>

396
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:34,299
here where it's almost as if we're

397
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,830
adding artificial jitter if if the if

398
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:38,980
the attack traffic takes these different

399
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,870
paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then to move a little</font>

400
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,549
faster here so to conclude we've

401
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,260
introduced tempura lensing it's a new

402
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:47,410
class of the denial service attack and

403
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,049
it uses it uses reflectors not to

404
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,809
amplify per se but to concentrate a

405
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:56,440
flood very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how it lens</font>

406
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:59,139
focuses light and by itself it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

407
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,559
an order<font color="#CCCCCC"> of magnitude bandwidth game and</font>

408
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:06,549
if combined with amplification perhaps

409
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:09,510
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and so thanks everyone for for</font>

Frank's Diana University of Cambridge

412
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,020
when you said you needed to lengthen the

413
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,700
window when you are doing distributed

414

sorry could you repeat that last part

417
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,050
could the distributed attackers not

418
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,250
synchronize themselves more accurately

419
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,480
than ntp by using<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS time yeah so that</font>

420
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,900
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably definitely definitely</font>

421
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,700
possible we just we we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried ntp</font>

but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes if they had some more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">fine-grained synchronization they could</font>

424
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:55,510
definitely probably do better than then

425
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,399
we did it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for our prototype we</font>

426
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,129
use ntp which is just like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

427
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,840
buying great enough and the other

428
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,910
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I didn't quite</font>

429
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,459
understand everything but when you get

430
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the flash like this how permanent is the</font>

431
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,320
damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it causes right so one</font>

432
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,290
single pulse will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do that</font>

433
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,870
much damage if done right it can perhaps

434
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,820
trigger a retransmit timeout and so the

435
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,250
idea would be to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just send one pulse</font>

436
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,230
but to send multiple pulses on some

437
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,480
fixed period and and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> scored more in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shrew and</font>

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:38,350
send these pulses to degrade<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP as much</font>

441
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:41,050
as possible yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you christian</font>

442
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,600
Russell's Ellen University I'm wondering

443
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">how much these attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually scale</font>

444
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,949
higher to<font color="#CCCCCC"> race that you've shown because</font>

445
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,600
the rates at<font color="#CCCCCC"> usual i actually just very</font>

446
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,000
small raised like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of hundred</font>

447
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,040
thousand packets per second especially

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm wondering about the buffers that may</font>

449
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,909
fill up at the reflector side when the

450
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,830
receive multiple of your requests right

451
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,420
that then the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> rtt essentially is</font>

452
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,129
screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because the buffers are</font>

453
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,660
filled up and it takes like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a random</font>

454
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,090
number of milliseconds to compute them

455
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,830
yeah so that's a valid point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

456
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because there's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so many</font>

457
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,949
reflectors out there right there's been

458
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,390
measurements that there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

459
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,380
don't know like millions of real effect

460
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,940
of reflectors filling up any one given

461
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,610
reflectors buffer shouldn't be a problem

462
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,610
if you distribute this attack to

463
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,610
multiple

464
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,570
reflectors yeah the other question the

465
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question I had was regarding a</font>

466
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,409
grouse and maybe that's just a matter of

467
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,360
visualization but in all the grass

468
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,760
you've shown that actually the despite

469
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,590
was before the attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission of the</font>

470
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">Packers health how could that be yeah</font>

471
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,320
yeah so the the time for the two graphs

472
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,270
was not actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> synchronized yeah right</font>

473
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks yeah it was just arbitrary</font>

474
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,418
time yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom and dad from the</font>

475
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,130
University of illinois-chicago I was

476
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,320
like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concerned at how would your</font>

477
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,360
attack model work if there was some kind

478
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,780
of scheduler or load balancer and the

479
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,899
victim was bend in an internal network

480
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:08,700
see so um are you asking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font>

481
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,159
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of buffering that happens at</font>

482
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,900
the victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim is in</font>

483
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,000
turn internal network and there's some

484
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:20,340
kind of middle box of proxy line between

485
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,169
it that's scheduling<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet so yes I I'm</font>

486
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,459
uncle how that would change things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

487
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,059
you saying it would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any order for</font>

488
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,530
an attack did you come in and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I me</font>

489
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:35,490
so if there's elements in the way right

490
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:38,970
so I mean ok so like it if there were

491
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,650
like elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network in the way the</font>

492
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,210
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the King style latency</font>

493
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,390
estimations will will take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

494
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">account right and so what we did is we</font>

495
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,700
essentially sent our talk traffic using

496
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,820
the same conduit that we obtain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead</font>

497
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">light see the light inseam measurements</font>

498
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,330
on so like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see how anything in</font>

499
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,280
the middle would affect that okay thank

500
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">you unfortunately we should probably</font>

501
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">move on to the next speaker let's think</font>

502
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,520
the speaker again
