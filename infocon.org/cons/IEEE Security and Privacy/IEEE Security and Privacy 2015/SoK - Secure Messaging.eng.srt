00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
ok so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sergey and I'm presenting our</font>

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,900
paper secure messaging which is an s

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay paper and this was done in joint</font>

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,630
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick younger and Ian Goldberg</font>

handing Matthew Smith and me from the

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:32,640
University of Bonn<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what was the</font>

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,739
motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our work so there since</font>

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,530
the Snowden revelations there is an

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,078
increasing demand for secure messaging

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">about ninety percent of the people are</font>

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,300
aware about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mass surveillance and</font>

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,969
also like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the</font>

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:54,209
people also have concerns about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

17
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:57,719
many users came to the eff to ask which

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,570
messengers they should use so for you

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the research if your friends</font>

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask you which messenger should I use</font>

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,510
what would you reply and yeah so this

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,380
definitely has a relevance for the

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,680
academia and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that recently</font>

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,070
more than 100 tools have been proposed

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,770
and implemented and they are offered in

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,520
the android<font color="#CCCCCC"> market which was evaluated</font>

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:31,079
by the eff scorecard but in academia

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,689
there are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few papers focusing on</font>

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,589
messaging and all those tools and

30
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:41,479
messengers they focus on individual

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,950
threat models and features yeah and

32
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:48,149
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some messaging specific</font>

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,490
research challenges and we found in our

34
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,770
paper that some academic work is

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,740
completely ignored and practice but also

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,189
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way around some truths which</font>

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:03,030
are implemented our have never been

38
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,270
evaluated in an academic fashion so our

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,720
goal is to present an overview over the

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,530
whole topic of secure messaging and also

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,040
to propose an evaluation criteria like

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,160
a scorecard for academics where the

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,489
different concepts are compared against

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,579
each other so of course with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

45
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,860
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also we consider usability</font>

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,600
and adoption with adoption we mean

47
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,300
sometimes there might be some

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,239
scalability problems in practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

49
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,970
some providers which would use such

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,980
systems and yeah and the end we

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,870
highlight some research challenges and

52
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,420
new perspectives so like every soft

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,530
paper there should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a huge table which</font>

54
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,630
is discussed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we noticed</font>

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are three completely</font>

56
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,630
orthogonal problem areas covered by most

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,970
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messengers which is first the</font>

58
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">trust establishment so if we get a key</font>

59
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,670
how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that the key belongs to</font>

60
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,769
the one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to then we have the</font>

61
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,859
conversation security that's where all

62
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,660
this crypto stuff is happening like

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,750
encrypting messages sending messengers

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:23,609
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font>

65
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:26,310
security do some key exchanges and also

66
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,709
the transport privacy if we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide</font>

67
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,910
who is communicating<font color="#CCCCCC"> with whom we want</font>

68
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,230
to hide all this metadata<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's</font>

69
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:40,560
start with a trust establishment here we

70
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,899
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a table I don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this table in detail but what you</font>

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,850
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there is that the black</font>

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,519
circles note that some features are

74
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,040
provided by a concept and the minus

75
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,560
means that it's not provided and what

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,989
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this table that if we</font>

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,239
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> the columns which are the</font>

78
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,090
features and there is a pillar with

79
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,910
usability there is no approach offering

80
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,519
both security and usability so it's

81
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">always a trade-off to offer security and</font>

82
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,549
usability or usability so the state of

83
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">the art</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and practice is like most of the</font>

84
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,579
messengers are like a trusted party and

85
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,950
they offer some key directories and the

86
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,310
server tells you which key is used by

87
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,240
the other participant and there is also

88
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">man</font>

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,380
your verification which is mostly

90
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,940
optional it's not like the messengers

91
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,190
required to do authentication so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at manual verification either we</font>

93
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,810
compare something<font color="#CCCCCC"> up prints or we scan a</font>

94
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,758
QR code but we could also do like some

95
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero-knowledge protocol where someone</font>

96
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,080
proved that he knows a secret and yeah

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,020
this optional verification thing there

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,090
is a tool named prima they have like

99
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">three different states like the red</font>

100
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,349
light means that someone is not

101
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,930
authenticated at all this orange light

102
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:08,880
means that the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this</font>

103
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,750
authentication and the green light<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

104
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,310
when you scan a QR code but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

105
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,860
at this at the academic approaches and

106
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:24,349
related security topics like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

107
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:27,150
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is certificate transparency which</font>

108
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:29,460
could also work for messaging but there

109
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,250
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no tool out there implementing</font>

110
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,830
certificate transparency but the big

111
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,110
advantage of the transparency is that it

112
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:42,000
doesn't require<font color="#E5E5E5"> any involvement of the</font>

113
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">user and yeah in this case the</font>

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,580
application would decide whether a key

115
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,299
should be trusted or not trusted and in

116
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,359
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end if someone will be hacked or his</font>

117
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,090
key will be replaced the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user or the</font>

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,479
owner of the key will get a message that

119
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,849
someone tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manipulate his keys on</font>

120
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,210
the key server so but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

121
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:08,940
practical issues and that's why some

122
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,310
companies still are reserved to this

123
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,530
approach and it's like what if some

124
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-users get this message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

125
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">misuse the system uploaded in Yuki and</font>

126
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,750
then they claim that the company you

127
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:24,780
replace this key or what about other key

128
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,940
changes like user change the keys all

129
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,099
the time reinstall the apps and so on

130
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,060
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also multi device</font>

131
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:36,389
management if someone uses an extra key

132
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,279
for every device and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we upload</font>

133
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,020
something to a key directory which is

134
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,199
accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the world</font>

135
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,169
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some privacy issues in our</font>

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,560
paper we covered some work from each of

137
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,870
this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah we don't have time to</font>

138
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">go in detail there also are some</font>

139
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:59,430
alternative solutions used in practice

140
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like key base one name namecoin and they</font>

141
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:07,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">never received an academic review so</font>

142
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,840
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second problem area is</font>

143
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:13,068
like conversation security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font>

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,138
where we actually secure the messages

145
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,729
here the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> features are</font>

146
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,560
confidentiality integrity and

147
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,750
authentication of the message but also

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,810
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to provide forwards and</font>

149
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:28,560
back what secrecy but compared to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

150
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:31,139
web messaging mostly is a synchronous so

151
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,630
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about email emails if you</font>

152
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:37,770
write an email and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response a few</font>

153
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:39,710
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> later so users are not online at</font>

154
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time but they also might use</font>

155
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,039
unreliable connections like on their

156
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,440
mobile phone where they have reception

157
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,440
and then they lose reception and so on

158
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,590
and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocols in the</font>

159
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,990
conversation security once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done</font>

160
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:58,609
this trust establishment phase they

161
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:03,419
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> require any interaction at all so</font>

162
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:07,380
those kind of features we in this kind

163
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:11,639
of protocols we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> only black circles</font>

164
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,460
for usability so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

165
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,960
forward secrecy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy in the</font>

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,310
web we just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your help</font>

167
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,130
authenticated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee Hellman key</font>

168
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,009
exchange and that's it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

169
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:28,199
messaging tools and practice they don't

170
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:30,360
use or they try to avoid forward secrecy

171
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,539
for messaging because of those a

172
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,729
synchronicity where it's not always

173
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,828
possible to do an end-to-end connection

174
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,500
to the other users<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why most of</font>

175
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:43,620
the tools they either don't support

176
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,640
forward secrecy at all or they just

177
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,480
require a synchronicity like OTR does

178
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,040
where you are able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate</font>

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">securely if both people</font>

180
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,980
our online and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> also are some tools</font>

181
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:06,360
which give a kind of forward secrecy but

182
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,480
in the wild there actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a 2a a</font>

183
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,959
tool like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech secure and pawned they</font>

184
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,050
implement the axolotl protocol which is

185
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,529
probably unknown in the academia and

186
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,008
there is just little work for an

187
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:27,930
academic revenue for that protocol but

188
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:30,839
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> scientists in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 70s away or they</font>

189
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,109
claim to have solved that solution in

190
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,940
the 70s that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case for a</font>

191
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,630
synchronous of what was accuracy but

192
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,540
there is a paper from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year two</font>

193
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,079
thousand three where they solved it but

194
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,540
this protocol or this approach of

195
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:52,649
cryptography has never been considered

196
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,680
in practice showing once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that even</font>

197
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:58,769
though we solved something in research

198
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,579
it doesn't get implemented and there

199
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:06,860
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a talk later in the afternoon</font>

200
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:10,529
for punctual encryption which even

201
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,730
improves this hierarchy<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibe approach of</font>

202
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:16,949
kinetic and all yeah so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,350
remaining challenges for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

204
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:23,339
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> security so most of the</font>

205
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">work now focuses on group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chat so here</font>

206
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,350
we still have to implement forward

207
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,620
secrecy but we also want some features

208
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:37,860
like deniability or transcript

209
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:41,399
consistency so and there is this last

210
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:46,130
problem area the transport privacy here

211
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:50,610
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect all the metadata and</font>

212
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:57,649
yeah the unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad news is</font>

213
00:10:50,610 --> 00:11:00,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that only a few tools actually actually</font>

214
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:03,149
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this thing most of the</font>

215
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,099
tools they just focus on conversation

216
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:08,920
security that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't read the</font>

217
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,860
of the messages but in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

218
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,040
are only two<font color="#E5E5E5"> practical tools which are</font>

219
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:21,730
used by some users and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pond and bit</font>

220
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,529
message most of those tools also have

221
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,779
some implications on usability and

222
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:29,410
adoption so if you for instance you

223
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">spawn you have message delays if you</font>

224
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,339
send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message the recipient receives</font>

225
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:38,380
this message a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few minutes later which</font>

226
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:40,990
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an instant messaging</font>

227
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,769
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some scalability issues</font>

228
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,889
like with a bit message where everything

229
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:50,920
is solved by a basically broadcasting

230
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:54,610
every message and the recipient tries to

231
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:59,199
decrypt all the messages and there is

232
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:02,190
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a spam and flat flood abuse which</font>

233
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:05,290
is dealt in pond and in a bit message

234
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,980
the thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you send messages</font>

235
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,899
anonymously then and don't see the

236
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,579
recipients or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sender's of the</font>

237
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:16,060
message and also don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the content</font>

238
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:19,649
then someone might just send out

239
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,430
messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to cover this and</font>

240
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:26,560
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also probably need some a</font>

241
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:30,300
private contact discovery because<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

242
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,180
though you secure all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messages they</font>

243
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,229
the contact discovery might still leave

244
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,899
some other data<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what are the</font>

245
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">take away so we presented a surgery and</font>

246
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:48,850
a systematization of the whole area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

247
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,029
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> many unconsidered approaches</font>

248
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,120
from both<font color="#E5E5E5"> world so some approaches which</font>

249
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:57,660
have been dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in academia but not</font>

250
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,910
in practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and</font>

251
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,089
we have an appeal for more academic

252
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,850
analysis in this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it should be</font>

253
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:10,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to SSL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android research</font>

254
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:13,060
where most of the proposal proposals and

255
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:16,360
practice also<font color="#E5E5E5"> received some academic</font>

256
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:20,040
reviews so reach out to developers and

257
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,040
security proofs are not enough

258
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:38,510
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of time for questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

259
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,800
while we're waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to come</font>

260
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,040
to the mic when do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're going</font>

261
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,130
to get multi-party OTR<font color="#E5E5E5"> or when do you</font>

262
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to get multi-party OTR</font>

263
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,870
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but in a few</font>

264
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:54,079
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a few years there is a</font>

265
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,810
tool it operates similar features to the

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:01,430
multi-party OTR and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's textsecure</font>

267
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:04,160
where they basically yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

268
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">broadcast approach so you send a message</font>

269
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a server secured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wit or encrypted</font>

270
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:16,160
with everyone's recipients key and yeah

271
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:20,060
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key material from the two-party</font>

272
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,270
thing and it's a kind of multi-party OTR

273
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:26,930
which already works in practice but

274
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:33,110
doesn't cover all the features provided

275
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:35,420
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual multi OTR paper I you</font>

276
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,460
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out saying that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a post</font>

277
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,920
Odin there is a demand for secure

278
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:46,600
end-to-end messaging it really I'm

279
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:51,829
curious where the demand is coming from

280
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,020
I didn't understand your question you

281
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:57,200
started your talk by saying that

282
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,079
post-snowden there is a demand for<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

283
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,490
and secure message based on a study it

284
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:08,630
was not our results oh yeah many people

285
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,790
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interviewed or talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to they said</font>

286
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,570
they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use something but</font>

287
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:17,360
most of the tools like three ma are they

288
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,670
wouldn't use it because most of they

289
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,940
can't reach everyone from their contact

290
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">list but most of the people would say</font>

291
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,500
yeah why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not they would use it if it</font>

292
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,010
they if they couldn't use it like

293
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,850
whatsapp<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's not like you've</font>

294
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,250
had lots

295
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:38,630
your friend say let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing secure</font>

296
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:43,120
messaging but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't that's</font>

297
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,120
why I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking yeah I just curious I</font>

298
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:53,630
think the lady actually stood up before

299
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:55,910
me so sorry uh cami<font color="#CCCCCC"> vanier Indiana</font>

300
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,699
University one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I deal</font>

301
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,680
with when I'm teaching introductory

302
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,269
computer science or<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer security</font>

303
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,239
class students is they're always asking

304
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,949
oh I've just found this new app and I

305
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,149
would though I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says it's secure</font>

306
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,620
i think i'm going to install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and use</font>

307
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,000
it how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i make this sort of judgment</font>

308
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,230
call and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things I thought</font>

309
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,850
would really interesting is you had

310
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,589
three components they were breaking this

311
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,360
into how applicable do you think this

312
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be as something you could say</font>

313
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,750
teach the beginning level security

314
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,849
people as a framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> for trying to</font>

315
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,699
determine whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not their new</font>

316
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,269
whiz-bang app is actually secure or not

317
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:31,819
as a systematic way to go through it

318
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,709
yeah so in our paper we extracted some

319
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:38,750
concepts which have been used to

320
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:41,569
practice and describe those so when

321
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,699
teaching you could explain those

322
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:46,759
approaches so we didn't cover something

323
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:49,069
like RSA we covered like a symmetric

324
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,560
crypto was the concept and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

325
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:53,599
the concept of like in forward secrecy

326
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,339
when you do a key exchange it doesn't

327
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,250
matter whether you use the PL man or

328
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:02,110
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so here we covered all</font>

329
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,110
those high-level concepts

330
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:10,719
I'm nadeem from Andrea I was just

331
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,609
wondering regarding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group messaging</font>

332
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,770
like multi-party OTR group messaging

333
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,448
protocols there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been actually to my</font>

334
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,900
knowledge a lot of protocols that do

335
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,490
accomplish this sort of group messaging

336
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,049
the axolotl protocol has implemented in

337
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,569
textsecure being one of them but also

338
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:28,030
other protocols and basically the way

339
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:30,580
they work is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have a common key</font>

340
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,960
and then they share that key they

341
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">encrypted multiple times and send it</font>

342
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,160
over and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

343
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">encrypt the message but however one key</font>

344
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,770
element that these protocols have<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

345
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:47,110
have been unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure a strength as</font>

346
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:50,020
transcript consistency so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is still a</font>

347
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,120
remaining challenge so we covered that

348
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,879
in the paper I didn't have too much time

349
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,479
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about transcript consistency</font>

350
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,500
but it's still an open challenge because

351
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,059
it's especially challenging for

352
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,880
usability because you somehow we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

353
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:09,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">show that so the transcript consistency</font>

354
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,210
is not hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the level to find that</font>

355
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,590
but to present that to the user it does

356
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,120
become more of a relevant issue when you

357
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,590
have multiple people as opposed to just

358
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,139
two people you want to ensure

359
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,439
consistency in this conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

360
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,440
thanks

361
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,919
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a question about the end end</font>

362
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:35,010
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of view of security and I'm sort</font>

363
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,710
of building on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question about you</font>

364
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my students saw an app is it</font>

365
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,900
secure if you don't know the provenance

366
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,600
of that app and that it was correctly

367
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:51,510
implemented your<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of what protocols</font>

368
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:53,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement seems kind of a vacuous in</font>

369
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,110
that if they're bugs in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

370
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,890
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it implements a yes or</font>

371
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,678
whatever did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider looking at the</font>

372
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,540
end end issues and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliability of a</font>

373
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,730
given implementation of the software in

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,629
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis yeah we did consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

375
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in this paper</font>
