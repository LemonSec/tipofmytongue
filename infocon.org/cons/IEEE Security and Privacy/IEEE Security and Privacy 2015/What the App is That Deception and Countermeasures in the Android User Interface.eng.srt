00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,870
California Santa Barbara so we all use

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,670
both internet browsers so and a mobile

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,100
application to interact with online

<font color="#CCCCCC">Android the two interfaces are pretty</font>

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,890
similar however there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fundamental</font>

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,809
difference that is that in the browser

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,360
we have a trusted indicator that is the

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,110
URL bar that is showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> us the origin of</font>

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,070
the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are interacting with</font>

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,579
unfortunately we don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,890
indicator in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile application so we</font>

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,410
investigated this problem and we found

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,020
that not only we don't have origin

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,919
indication in mobile applications but

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,090
also the graphical separations between

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,430
different applications is not the

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,699
strongest for instance between different

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,580
tabs in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a browser and in addition the</font>

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,289
separation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between apps is not complete</font>

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,330
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance an application can know</font>

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,610
the application a user is actually is

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,679
currently interacting with so the

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,049
combination of these trees expects

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,600
allows an attacker to easily perform

32
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,880
attacks like phishing attacks as i'm

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you in this video so in</font>

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,000
this video user simply open<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook is</font>

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the legitimate facebook login page and</font>

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we are going to open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a malicious</font>

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,570
malicious application so now the

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,130
malicious application is running in

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:48,419
background now and now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user is</font>

41
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,908
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open facebook again but what</font>

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see are it appears exactly as the</font>

43
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,259
original facebook login page but it is

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,939
not it is a window spawned by the

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,590
malicious application because the

46
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,689
malicious application detected that the

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">user was trying to open their legitimate</font>

48
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,619
facebook application and cover it with a

49
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious window malicious facebook</font>

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,480
login page so

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,250
in our paper we systematically study the

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,230
different techniques that allows these

53
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,390
kind of attacks and that we genetically

54
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,299
call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google confusion attacks and</font>

55
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,179
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop two defenses so the</font>

56
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,549
first one is market level<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's based</font>

57
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,799
on static analysis and the second one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

58
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:32,110
based on you I modifications and so we

59
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,599
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applied on any device</font>

60
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,830
and to evaluate<font color="#CCCCCC"> this second defense we</font>

61
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:41,829
perform a user study so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

62
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,530
different techniques in an attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

63
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,690
use to exploit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mythical the missing</font>

64
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,099
graphical separations and in the paper

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,260
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font>

66
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,599
and some of these techniques are were

67
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:56,379
already known some of them instead are

68
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:59,140
novel and we have categorized them in

69
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,030
three big categories so first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all an</font>

70
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,369
application can simply draw content on

71
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,819
top of other apps as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,890
image in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> the small circular window</font>

73
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,920
is actually a window from the facebook

74
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Messenger hub on top of the paper login</font>

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
window so then a nap can also just which

76
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,420
the application that the wind of the

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,480
user is interacting with as we have seen

78
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,010
in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video in which in the</font>

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,869
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which the user was starting</font>

80
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,019
interacting with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

81
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook page the user interaction was</font>

82
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:35,200
switched<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious windows to the</font>

83
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious facebook login page and those</font>

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,328
so application can can go can spoon full

85
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,399
screen windows that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this allow even</font>

86
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,349
more powerful attacks since they can

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,720
also cover areas that are usually just

88
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,200
used by assistant components such as the

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,389
navigation bar or the order status bar

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,548
so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexity of the android</font>

91
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:56,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">api managing these aspects we also</font>

92
00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,760
develop a automatic<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool to</font>

93
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:03,280
automatically automatically exercise the

94
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,138
api managing these aspects and in

95
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,540
particular we<font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise some specificity</font>

96
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:09,940
is and we try them with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the possible</font>

97
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,819
parameters and one interesting finding

98
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,290
we had in this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> until early if</font>

99
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> scream windows there should be</font>

100
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,238
always the should we always be an easy

101
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,579
way to close<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and to switch to another</font>

102
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,400
app however<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found combination of</font>

103
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,670
flags that allows an attacker to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,289
a

105
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,500
screaming that the total is controlling

106
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,180
completely the device screen but also

107
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,840
doing so in a way that it's impossible

108
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a user to to escape from this so</font>

109
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,479
there isn't another another aspect that

110
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,670
an attacker needs to consider to perform

111
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,920
an efficient attack is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

112
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,350
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about user interaction with</font>

113
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,270
other apps in fact in the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

114
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,820
seen that that was effective because the

115
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,859
malicious window was open exactly when

116
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,680
the user was was expecting to interact

117
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the legitimate one so to achieve</font>

118
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,780
this goal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack it needs to know</font>

119
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,090
what is the intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet intended</font>

120
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,309
window the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Union which is the wind of</font>

121
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,250
the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to actually interact with</font>

122
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,980
so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and up to</font>

123
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,170
android 4.4 there was an API just that

124
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can just use to get this information</font>

125
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the behavior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

126
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,270
bapi change but still<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's possible to</font>

127
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,730
use some side channel so channels and in

128
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,530
particular reading the stat I'm file in

129
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,260
the profile system as has been explained

130
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:34,210
in detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a paper published at user</font>

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:37,599
Knicks last year so so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend</font>

132
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,409
from these from these attacks we

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,420
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> first a solution based on</font>

134
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,070
state based on static analysis so that

135
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,620
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> envision that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution could be</font>

136
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,960
used for instance during the vetting

137
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,870
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> at market</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level of the submitted</font>

138
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,000
applications so our our solution is

139
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed to detect the conditions that</font>

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">are necessary for an application to</font>

141
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:03,340
perform this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks in</font>

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,110
particular we we check if these two

143
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,119
features are present in an app so we

144
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,710
check if an app is trying to the tech

145
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,290
which app is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user is interacting</font>

146
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,599
with and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if an app is using a</font>

147
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,210
technique to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump or draw some content</font>

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,950
on top of other apps to detect these two

149
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,539
feature we use code slicing and of

150
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,420
course you can find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

151
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,090
paper and we check if specificity is our

152
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,020
call with specific parameters we've also

153
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">checked if the code location where the</font>

154
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,280
first two features are detected are

155
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,070
connected in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the control flow</font>

156
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,440
graph and to do so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do simply</font>

157
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:42,190
control flow analysis

158
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,110
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of sample our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

159
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,060
was able to detect and this sample is

160
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,920
pretty interesting because is waiting

161
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,380
for the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open the official google</font>

162
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,870
play store up but then is showing on top

163
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,340
of it a malicious windows asking for

164
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,570
credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card information but what is</font>

165
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,820
interesting is that these windows

166
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually is mimicking the legitimate</font>

167
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,219
wind of that the google play store opens

168
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:07,360
when forest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a user wants to buy not</font>

169
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,370
free not not free content so we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,980
our tool on larger data sets of

171
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,980
applications and we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

172
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,810
interns in samples in both set of

173
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,360
malicious apps and a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of benign apps</font>

174
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,220
and we found in fact a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample</font>

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,490
that heavily interferes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> android</font>

176
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,870
user interface and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

177
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,810
particular linear interesting category

178
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,540
for applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are legitimate but</font>

179
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,270
they perform really<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to an</font>

180
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,760
attacker because these applications are

181
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,710
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> up lockers are designed to</font>

182
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,230
basically prevent a user to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact</font>

183
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,390
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific apps and they do so by</font>

184
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,950
checking which is the apt a user wants

185
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,409
to interact and covering it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

186
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,919
window unless a unlock password is

187
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:53,560
inserted so from this result we can see

188
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our tool is able to detect</font>

189
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,330
application that heaven interferes with

190
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> android user interface but to</font>

191
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,099
actually understand exactly if these

192
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,870
interference is benign or malicious we

193
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,730
need to understand the semantics of an

194
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,110
app we need to understand if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goldie</font>

195
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,130
artist trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve is really</font>

196
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:16,919
bananas or malicious so we could rely on

197
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:19,360
manual analysis but we also decide to

198
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,580
design a different solution to this

199
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,980
problem that is based on modification on

200
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> android user interface so the idea</font>

201
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the underlining root cause of these</font>

202
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems that the user has no way to</font>

203
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,580
understand which is the app is currently

204
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,439
interacting with and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> no is in other</font>

205
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,900
words as it has no way to understand the

206
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the origin of the content is interacting</font>

207
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,510
with so to solve this issue we design a

208
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,400
security indicator though that you can

209
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,920
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the bottom of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line that is</font>

210
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,439
basically showing the origin of the

211
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,719
window a user is interacting with and we

212
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,970
design it to be similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,009
modern browser is showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

214
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,939
about the origin of the other page a

215
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:02,800
user is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interacting so the first problem</font>

216
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:06,009
we had to solve in designing these

217
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,810
security indicator was to choose which

218
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:10,480
kind of information about the origin of

219
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,729
an app we want to provide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user so</font>

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,550
we could have we could have shown to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

221
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,319
user the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big icon of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> airport the name or</font>

222
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> developer name from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the market</font>

223
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:21,069
however this information is not really

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,170
reliable for reasons in this image i'm

225
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:25,990
showing you what what appears if you

226
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,849
look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the popular 2048 game in the</font>

227
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,769
google play store and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

228
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,839
different apps try to mimic the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name and</font>

229
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:35,079
the graphical appearance of others and

230
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">in particular the one the let's say from</font>

231
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the original from from the original</font>

232
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:42,519
inventor is listed in position but the

233
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,389
name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not giving really as this kind</font>

234
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,310
of information so we decide to rely to

235
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,959
take a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution so to rely on</font>

236
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">a existing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL AV external validation</font>

237
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,040
infrastructure and more precisely we

238
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,790
decided to show the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

239
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,800
acquired from ssl AV certificate that a

240
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:07,050
developer they wants to use our system

241
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,180
for for his own app needs to to get and

242
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,969
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting problem we had to</font>

243
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,579
solve in other in other in other in the

244
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,420
design of our security indicator was how

245
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information in a reliable way so</font>

246
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,229
we decide to use the navigation bar

247
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,689
since it is usually always shown to the

248
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,550
user but there are full scale

249
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:29,290
applications so full screen application

250
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,449
could potentially cover the navigation

251
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,639
bar and show<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spoofed security</font>

252
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:37,569
indicator so to solve this issue we

253
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:40,209
simply decide to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a on a secure a</font>

254
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,899
secret image that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an image chosen by</font>

255
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:46,268
the user on when it is first using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

256
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:48,970
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this secret image in this</font>

257
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:52,209
light is the small world icon on the

258
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,949
bottom and so in this way even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if an</font>

259
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,349
application a malicious application goes

260
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:58,269
full screen it cannot spoof correctly

261
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,199
the secret image because it simply

262
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:06,370
doesn't know it doesn't know the image

263
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:08,469
chosen by the user so in this

264
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how the attack we</font>

265
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,390
have seen before appears with our

266
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:16,180
defense in place so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're official</font>

267
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,580
windows from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future window from</font>

268
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,680
facebook is<font color="#E5E5E5"> opening but the user can</font>

269
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,779
understand this by looking at the at the

270
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,290
security indicator that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing the</font>

271
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:31,779
company behind these window then we open

272
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attack application again here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

273
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so there are a complication now is</font>

274
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,339
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user tries again</font>

275
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to interact with Facebook the malicious</font>

276
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,270
application is covering facebook again

277
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,700
but now the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> can at least understand</font>

278
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,620
that this window is not from facebook

279
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,870
anymore because not by noticing the

280
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,800
absence of any security indicator on

281
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:56,529
this window so we we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluate</font>

282
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">our system so we perform a user study</font>

283
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:03,430
using 300 with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 308 subjects from</font>

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,589
mechanical turk and we divided them in

285
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,359
three in three groups so subject from

286
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first group were just interacting</font>

287
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,870
with sander<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android subject for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

288
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,810
second group we were they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

289
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,580
interacting with the season which our

290
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,910
defense was in place and then we had

291
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,740
group 3 in which subject that was

292
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,569
basically as group<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 but in addition we</font>

293
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,610
were giving we are providing some

294
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,830
additional information to the user to

295
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subjects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the functionality of</font>

296
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,920
the security indicator so to evaluate

297
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,010
subjects we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interact with</font>

298
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,890
facebook four times and and after each

299
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,819
interaction interaction we asked if we

300
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked if they if they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were thinking that</font>

301
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">they they were interacting with the</font>

302
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:51,640
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook up or not and actually</font>

303
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,709
I've during two of these interactions we

304
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,449
perform an attack so in one case we were

305
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,430
from the attack exactly as we have seen

306
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,670
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video that is malicious app just</font>

307
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,859
cover the original facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> login window</font>

308
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case we simulate the case</font>

309
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,430
in which an app is also trying to spoof

310
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,339
the security indicator but of course it

311
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:14,400
fails in showing a proper secret image

312
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:17,290
and in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> table we have the results so</font>

313
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,900
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important to see is that in</font>

314
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one with standard Android</font>

315
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,970
only two percent of users were able to

316
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,069
actually classify correctly all the four

317
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,490
interactions probably just by random

318
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,080
luck and instead in group<font color="#CCCCCC"> two more than</font>

319
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,080
half of the subjects were able to

320
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,420
actually detect when they were under

321
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,760
attack so another interesting result is

322
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,400
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack in which we were showing</font>

323
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,260
a spoof we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spoof the</font>

324
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,010
security indicator but showing an

325
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,319
incorrect secret image in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font>

326
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,150
was easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be detected than the other</font>

327
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,830
the one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we were not showing any</font>

328
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,290
security indicator and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

329
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,150
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that unexpected the</font>

330
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,310
secret image is more is raising more

331
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,800
while warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

332
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,989
subject than just the absence on any

333
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,449
security indication and you can also see

334
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that group three perform only slightly</font>

335
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,010
better than group 2 and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

336
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,710
because group maybe a group<font color="#CCCCCC"> three the</font>

337
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,140
explanation we gave was not good enough

338
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:21,430
or simply because group two were already

339
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:24,160
informed enough so to conclude in our

340
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,989
paper we study the problem of<font color="#E5E5E5"> glue</font>

341
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">confusion attacks in android and we</font>

342
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">propose two solutions one based on</font>

one and another that can be applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

346
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,800
every device based on modification on

the UI and we evaluated eat with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

348

user study and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the source</font>

349

code of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the our own device defense on</font>

350
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:49,410
get up so and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm ready to</font>

351
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,410
answer two questions

352
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">simpson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> garfinkel missed there's been a</font>

353
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:06,279
lot of research on the desktop that

354
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:08,769
users<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore security indicators and so</font>

355
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering why you thought that</font>

356
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:12,790
they were not ignoring your security

357
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,670
indicator is because they were in an

358
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,889
artificial study and they might grow

359
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:22,870
used to it over time were something else

360
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:24,759
so so there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of research on the</font>

361
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,870
extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also of course on browsers</font>

362
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,629
about security indicators and it's true

363
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of papers say that security</font>

364
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,930
indicators on browsers are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

365
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,420
effective but there are also papers for

366
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,399
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allison one in</font>

367
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,769
warning land that is a recent paper that

368
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,740
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> showing out a proper security</font>

369
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:47,370
indicator is actually effective so for

370
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,740
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we try to simulate our</font>

371
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,620
modern browsers show security indication

372
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,870
and and you can also find the comparison

373
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,040
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a modern browser and our defense</font>

374
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,050
you can find it exactly in the paper

375
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,209
exactly how we are kind of similar so

376
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,180
what prevents the malware from reading

377
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:09,310
the security indicator so we we save it

378
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,769
a cigarette<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine in a in a folder</font>

379
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is not accessible to naked</font>

380
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,630
screenshot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a screenshot in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

381
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,209
are always mediated by the operating

382
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,199
system so we and in any case they

383
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:25,359
require user input but we change the

384
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,990
diff a TI provided by the operating

385
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,990
system so that that region is not

386
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,990
screenshot

387
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,170
so I wonder how applicable the attacks

388
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,449
you've described in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the methodology if</font>

389
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,599
it's described is to other mobile

390
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,790
operating systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like iOS and under</font>

391
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,290
mobile we didn't look specifically into

392
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:53,480
it but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as you have a way</font>

393
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,920
to jump on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of another app and you</font>

394
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,069
have a way to understand what the user

395
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,209
is doing either by normal API or by some

396
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:05,779
side channel I think this applicable and

397
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,720
also the fact the fact that an app can

398
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:10,490
jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app may be</font>

399
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,260
considered as a bad thing of the API but

400
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,620
it may also be necessary for instance if

401
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:20,419
you have a alarm up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you want it</font>

402
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:22,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to jump on top so did my I</font>

403
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,959
didn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at specifically into other</font>

404
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,388
operating system but as far as you have

405
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two things I think is applicable</font>

406
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:29,689
yeah I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondered because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

407
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,120
those systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't seem to suffer from</font>

408
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,620
these problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so maybe moral of the</font>

409
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,629
story is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a bad operating</font>

410
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,209
system design choice rather than a good

411
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,380
operating system design choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

412
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,639
be interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to revisit some of these</font>

413
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,409
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see whether the user</font>

414
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:45,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience on those devices is similar</font>

415
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,630
or not in terms of the user study you

416
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,830
did what was the time period the study

417
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,889
was over you said you had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

418
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:55,370
rounds where you askin do<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so the</font>

419
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the so we had for interactions so more</font>

420
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,370
in average every user was interacting

421
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:04,250
for about 15 minutes considering also

422
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:07,010
the initial question so yes they were

423
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,309
interacting through a browser so it was

424
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,960
a browser connected through VNC to wait

425
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,639
emulator back and do it sort of a

426
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-week study and yes whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

427
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,449
there's definitely an interesting thing

428
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:19,490
I guess the last observation was a lot

429
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">of research and 1990s into compartmented</font>

430
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,179
mode work stations which looked at how

431
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,740
do you label windows in terms of

432
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:26,659
security out here the use of study

433
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,010
methodology at that point was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

434
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:29,600
kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do now but it will</font>

435
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">be interesting to see whether there are</font>

436
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,330
other techniques from that environment

437
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,730
such as the use of trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

438
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,860
goes do exist in iOS but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess don't</font>

439
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:41,299
exist in many Android devices thanks

440
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,830
thanks our concern from our College of

441
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,929
permanent memory so I'll follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

442
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,389
question on that a secure display

443
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,140
question so so I assume you were

444
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,719
security

445
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,930
security indicator will be a changing

446
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,820
knowledge aesthetic right so to use that

447
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,680
as one picture for the security

448
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,460
indicator or you will change it every

449
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,940
time the user login to open this app so

450
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use a static one the attacker if</font>

451
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,550
they know this one they can easily prove

452
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,969
yourself still this image so if you

453
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:16,760
change this every time for the then you

454
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,580
will need the user depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the user</font>

455
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,740
to recognize which this security

456
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,659
indicator our ballot indicator of which

457
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,150
are just maybe just<font color="#CCCCCC"> fake by the</font>

458
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,330
malicious app so I'm speaking about the

459
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret image or a security indicator so</font>

460
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,409
in our in our design the secret image is

461
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,540
chosen by the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user is free</font>

462
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,750
to change to change it if you want but

463
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,180
it's generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the same unless it</font>

464
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,860
changes but in any case the attacker

465
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:49,280
cannot easily guess it because it's you

466
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,399
cannot so it's saving a private location

467
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,800
and you cannot screenshot it so I don't

468
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,720
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how then attacker could actually</font>

469
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:01,580
guess the secret image<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh hello I</font>

470
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,140
had a quick additional question about

471
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,510
the user study i'm curious how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

472
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,030
rounds the participants saw so how many

473
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,740
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces and whether or not</font>

474
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,410
the indicator was present and absent

475
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,530
like or what percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time so</font>

476
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:20,210
subject so in our user study we did for

477
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:22,100
interactions and in two of them the user

478
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,400
was not attacking to a damaged the user

479
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:29,600
was attacked and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> randomized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

480
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:32,830
disorder and so so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said in total</font>

481
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,659
the interaction was around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 minutes</font>

482
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,280
total experiment you're not to concern

483
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,490
you so you you weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really testing</font>

484
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,260
situation at all in these subjects so

485
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,940
the habituation so you're not talking it

486
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,200
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the subjects if they saw</font>

487
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,790
this 20 times would then start

488
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,890
forgetting about the indicator which is

489
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,490
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> primary concerns no we did</font>

490
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:54,620
not but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely the one of the</font>

491
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,860
most interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> next next future work</font>

492
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,939
thank you not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

493
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,780
question

494
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,310
just ask it and that question so the

495
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,620
bottle<font color="#CCCCCC"> duplication for z/os we do need</font>

496
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:10,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll with the phone to do this or not</font>

497
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,050
yes in the sense that yeah these are

498
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,600
modification of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android operating</font>

499
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:18,350
system so they either needs to be

500
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,500
implemented in the standalone Android or

501
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,120
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to root your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> food to flash</font>

502
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,590
on your phone and modified android

503
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,169
version so you're about to convince

504
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google to do that so sorry so you're</font>

505
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:33,740
about to convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google to do it yes I</font>

506
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,900
don't know maybe good but you can find

507
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:40,610
the source code if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at</font>

508
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,970
it in here all right let's thank the

509
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,969
speaker
