1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:08,250
thankfully introduction Chris so yeah

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:11,309
let me start with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual story so my</font>

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,340
labmate whose name is Tong yang who lent

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,740
his laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what his</font>

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,230
friend does is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rare normal things so he</font>

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,750
searched something on the web and what

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,900
the thing research is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> japdi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,269
a TV show and then the some search

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,419
result shows out and sings goes very

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,910
smoothly however this is not enough

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,520
story and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> chapters show actually</font>

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,620
going to some further things so see what

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,379
we generate a categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> called I laughs</font>

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,510
jeopardy which is the recommendation ng

15
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,820
actually inferred from the search of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jap tea and then it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through the</font>

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,190
recommendation engine of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's</font>

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,800
accommodation engine and then it's going

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,589
to generate some more things in my

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,559
friends tongues mobile phone so what he

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">receive is receive something related to</font>

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,080
Japanese show on his google now and who

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">received</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> marshals like like a molest</font>

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,048
mcdeere and other see however my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend</font>

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,360
tanya is not interesting the chapters

26
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,549
show at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he don't want his show on</font>

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,250
his cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and therefore he want to</font>

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,830
this deputy show to be deleted from his

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,740
google search history so what he did is

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,470
he just<font color="#CCCCCC"> plead the jepty from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the google</font>

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,039
search so he blacked out this search

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,500
without however that he still receive a

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,020
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those recommendations on his cell</font>

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,960
phone the reason is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because in not just</font>

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,350
the data which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> japanese show it</font>

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,720
is also the lineage which is the

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,740
recommendation engine and also the

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,320
without and this is even amplified in

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,570
the world of big data so in the world

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,270
our big data you have some original data

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,119
and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to generate more data</font>

42
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,939
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a full-size image are going</font>

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,409
to generate a thumbnail and

44
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:04,169
recommendation of those movies are going

45
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,909
to generate more movies and also this

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,770
data actually propagated through

47
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,340
different cloud and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join</font>

48
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,850
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> more data and in such a world</font>

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,220
of big data if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to forget</font>

50
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,609
seeing we want to forget it completely

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,859
both the data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data lineage so</font>

52
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,020
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually the first reason we</font>

53
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,730
want a system to forget that it because

54
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some usability issues in this system</font>

55
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,510
next I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present a second</font>

56
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,870
reason that we want the system to forget

57
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,090
say instead of search a jab d show this

58
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,340
guy actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> search a heart disease</font>

59
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,980
because that he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart disease and</font>

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,380
then with documentation ng are going to

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,929
recommend more medicines related to

62
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,609
heart disease naturally this guy don't

63
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,800
want people to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he had has</font>

64
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,930
heart disease and therefore he want the

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,440
system to forget that the fact that he

66
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">had heart disease however my private</font>

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,210
paper that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just the training data</font>

68
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,010
but it also documentation engine and

69
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,250
people can actually reading for work

70
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,700
that the guy have a heart disease from

71
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,620
recommendation engine from the item item

72
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,859
matrix and this is called system in

73
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">florence attack so that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when we</font>

74
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,750
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dinner we also want to</font>

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,820
delete the original data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

76
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,820
data lineage which is recommendation

77
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,190
engine and the search result so this is

78
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second reason we want a system to</font>

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,820
forget then we come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third rhythm</font>

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,870
that see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a system that try</font>

81
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to detect spam and benign email so this</font>

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,220
works very perfectly you have some

83
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,950
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> labour spam or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bean I email then</font>

84
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are going to label a coming samples</font>

85
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,320
as either pinay or spam however

86
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,579
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a diverse read motion</font>

87
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,880
learning that some people can actually

88
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,000
pollute the training data so we have a

89
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,250
bad ninja and who actually polluted the

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,410
data and therefore he can influence the

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,570
detection result of existing spam

92
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">detection engine and a spam may be</font>

93
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,579
mislabeled as a bean I email and

94
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,619
therefore what we want to delete the

95
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,930
data which actually not just the

96
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,019
original data which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the polluted data</font>

97
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,250
but also the data lineage which is the

98
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,109
pool in the model and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result so</font>

99
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,350
realizing this what we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do</font>

100
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,930
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call me for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> envision which car</font>

101
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,150
forgetting system and such system are

102
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,310
capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forgetting the packet of data</font>

103
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,530
which is example in the rating for

104
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,630
different movies and also the data

105
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,760
lineage which could be some statistical

106
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,010
of the data or the motion learning model

107
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,260
and everything be embedded in the cloud

108
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,710
so that means we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to complete</font>

109
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,230
remove everything from the cloud so this

110
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:54,620
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our big envision and the focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

111
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:57,500
paper is we freak some martial learning

112
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">engine and therefore this um this</font>

113
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,750
forgetting emotional learning engine is

114
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,610
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine unlearning or four shot</font>

115
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,410
motion unlearning and the ultimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

116
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,210
of doing a learn is actually called

117
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,580
retraining that's very simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

118
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,070
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that atrophic gate from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

119
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,740
training<font color="#CCCCCC"> data and retrain the engine</font>

120
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,110
from scratch however that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this could be</font>

121
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,790
very slow for example for large they

122
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,400
said some of the training could take

123
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,620
days to complete and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore that's</font>

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,719
why we are going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

125
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">called motion our learning there are two</font>

126
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,810
very important goals in this unlearning

127
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,120
process which are completeness and

128
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,280
timeliness completeness means that how

129
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,950
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> this unlearned model is</font>

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,650
different from this retrained model we

131
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">want it to be as close as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to</font>

132
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,739
the retread model and second is timeless

133
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,440
witness means that how fast we're going

134
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to achieve the unlearning process we</font>

135
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,870
want to shrink the vulnerable window as

136
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,969
short as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason is because</font>

137
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it is longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> produce</font>

138
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,260
incorrect results as in the pollutant

139
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,980
model also going to link private

140
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,740
information in the privacy motivations

141
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,570
so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I introduce the detail of</font>

142
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,000
motion are learning I first just

143
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce some background of existing</font>

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,230
mushroom learning model so here is how

145
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,530
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine learning model works so</font>

146
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:31,370
we have some training data and here

147
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,650
training data is x1 x2 x3 and x4 and

148
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,050
then we're going to train a model based

149
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,780

data dependency this model actually

151
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:45,469
depends on all the training

152
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:48,498
which is x1 x2 x3 and x4 now let's take

153
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:50,870
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the unlearn process so now</font>

learn process what we're going to do is

155
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,849
we transform the existing machine

157
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:01,069
called citizen query learning and such

159
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:06,110

<font color="#CCCCCC">the number of training data and we show</font>

165
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,089
that many existing machine learning

quo learning forum with exactly the same

168
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,889

169
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,169
format that those two are exactly the

170
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">same in the model and examples are shown</font>

173
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:44,300
and some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> six and now let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

174
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:47,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at how statistical query learning</font>

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,149
works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unlearning process now</font>

176
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:55,399
clear we have all the training data

177
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:57,319
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> X 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X 2 X 3 and then based on</font>

178
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,620
the training<font color="#CCCCCC"> data we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

179
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,589
generate something called summation form

180
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,469
this is shows when summations so we

181
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:08,899
first apply a function called<font color="#E5E5E5"> g1 upon</font>

182
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:11,719
each of the training<font color="#CCCCCC"> data and then add</font>

183
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,909
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> together so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G Wang will be very</font>

184
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:17,479
officially computer functions such as

185
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:20,149
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> x 1 square X when Drew square all</font>

186
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,628
XX 1 divided<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the number of training</font>

187
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:26,180
data so that is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient the</font>

188
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:28,759
computer functions and then we have a

189
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">limited number of summations based on</font>

190
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,260
different of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> G functions we have g1</font>

191
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:36,620
and g2 you can have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

192
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,689
summations and then we're going to

193
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">compute this motion learning model</font>

194
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,529
purely on those summations instead of of

195
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,260
the initial training data and then let's

196
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:51,980
take a look at how this unlearn process

197
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,810
works so now assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> X 4 is the data</font>

198
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,529
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unlearn from this</font>

199
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,768
mushroom

200
00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:00,170
learning algorithm so obviously the

201
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">first case is we should move it from the</font>

202
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">training data so extraordinary and data</font>

203
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,949
and then what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do is we're</font>

204
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,980
going to minors g1x for from the

205
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,389
summation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we update the summation and</font>

206
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,999
then we'll all stop eight other

207
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,220
summation after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

208
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:21,889
recompute the motion learning model

209
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,459
based on the newly updated summations

210
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:27,860
and this is this how the unlearn works

211
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:32,748
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> district or e-learning and this</font>

212
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:35,240
process is both complete and timely for

213
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:38,600
complete the reason is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

214
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,990
process is exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if this</font>

215
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,170
data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> x 4 never existed before</font>

216
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,240
so if you compute it just from x1 to x3

217
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,870
and the model is exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same and</font>

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,899
that's why is complete a second this

219
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,540
process is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> timely the reason is</font>

220
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,059
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process purely depends on</font>

221
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,250
the number of summations instead of a

222
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,800
number of training data and therefore

223
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,559
the time complexity is based our number

224
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">of summations and number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of summation is</font>

225
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:13,490
much less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of training</font>

226
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:17,959
data and that is why we are timely so

227
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:20,720
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've introduced one of these status</font>

228
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,939
quo learning which we call now adaptive

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,449
stirzaker learning that's another type

230
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:28,910
of static or learning and we call it

231
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:32,000
adaptive status<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cora learning so the</font>

232
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,399
difference is for now adaptive score

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,759
learning we know what the G function is

234
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,250
so we know the statics<font color="#CCCCCC"> up front and for</font>

235
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,889
now adaptive circle learning we don't

236
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,629
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this G functions up front we need</font>

237
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:47,329
to decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the G function based on</font>

238
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:49,220
previous to read out and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

239
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to go through different iterations</font>

240
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,850
until this function converge so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

241
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:59,420
how the earth we have a initial state

242
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,179
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> else 0 and then we're going to</font>

243
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,819
compute the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next state as one based on</font>

244
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:07,990
the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> with s0 and the same</font>

245
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,459
at formation form as I just introduced

246
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,709
and then what goes through different

247
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:14,229
iterations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tier this process</font>

248
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,829
converge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say this example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is after</font>

249
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iterations and this process converge</font>

250
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,770
and now let's take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

251
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,870
learning process in this adaptive

stalker learning what we're going to do

253
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,510
is for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last step which is the</font>

254

255
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:38,200
going to minors this g one as my ex k

256
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,640
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the number the data to forget</font>

257
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will recompute the s10 and we're</font>

258
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to ask if this converge actually</font>

259
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,829
most of the case is already converged

260
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,020
and that's good and while they finish

261
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,910
our learning process and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

262
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">converge we need to go through its</font>

263
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,079
iterations again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here it convert it</font>

264
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,020
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes through one or three iterations</font>

265
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,510
and chair to converge and as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

266
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,800
this process is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> most little</font>

267
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,779
completely if you are interested please

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">allow paper about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completeness and</font>

269
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:09,640
also the process is also timely and the

270
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,260
reason is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that will start from</font>

271
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,660
the previous two converging point and

272
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,720
therefore this time complexity is much

294
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:19,300
networks now let's take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font>

295
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,830
overall without so what we're going to

296
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,829
do is we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> first going to perform</font>

297
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:28,460
real word attacks on those four systems

298
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:30,290
which is those Lansky and Zelda all the

299
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,110
stuff and then we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if they</font>

300
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">are vulnerable to either privacy leaks</font>

301
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,520
which is system<font color="#CCCCCC"> inference attack or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wall</font>

302
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,010
about to pollution attacks we show that

303
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,870
Lansky it is actually vulnerable to a

304
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,640
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> influence attack and others are</font>

305
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,220
vulnerable to pollution attack that

306
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,199
means they all need unlearning if it

307
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,840
gets polluted or leaking private

308
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,730
information and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to convert</font>

309
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,180
it to the summation form and wish you

310
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all three of them except for girls</font>

311
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,989
working this decision tree which cannot

312
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,839
be converted to the summation form when

313
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,510
others can be smoothly converted to the

314
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,090
summation form and then we're going to

315
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:11,270
show both analytical and empirical

316
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:14,330
without and from both analytically and

317
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,430
empirically that our and learning

318
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,500
process is faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the retraining</font>

319
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,900
which is magnitude larger than

320
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,930
retraining and also our process is

321
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,390
complete if it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> converted to the</font>

322
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,979
summation form except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Goethe are we</font>

323
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,100
choose decision tree it cannot be

324
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,670
converted to the summation form in

325
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,530
conclusion in this talk we propose

326
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:39,020
forgetting system and in particular this

327
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,360
focus of the paper is a motion on

328
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,670
learning which is to make machine

329
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,060
learning engine forget they have learned

330
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:49,849
before and we convert existing system in

331
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,369
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> for real-world systems to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

332
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,470
summation form and except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy</font>

333
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,260
here we have three of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we show</font>

334
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,210
that learning is both complete means

335
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,840
that we can achieve the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> result as</font>

336
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">retraining and also we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve</font>

337
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,970
timeliness which means we are fast

338
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,660
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now we come to the question</font>

339
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:14,960
and the joke so I would imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

340
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,939
after the talk that a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

341
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,580
answer the question will be what is this

342
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,620
guy sings<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlearning talk or his name i</font>

343
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,470
forgot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer</font>

344
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,720
will be i forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually our</font>

345
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:31,120
ultimate way all making<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems forget</font>

346
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
is making a human being forget thank you

347
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:42,709
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much easier does anyone have</font>

348
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:46,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">any questions so thank you I like very</font>

349
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,109
much the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of unlearning and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you told</font>

350
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,760
us how you could do that for particular

351
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,589
algorithms but you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

352
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,779
address the question of what about the

353
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,550
lineage if I'm in a cloud and I learn a

354
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,250
model and I pass my model on to somebody

355
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,319
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that gets passed on again even</font>

356
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,269
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I return</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first one the old</font>

357
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,100
models are still floating around so what

358
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,350
do we do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

359
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,209
question it's a great great question so

360
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually console version of the motion</font>

361
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:13,040
on learning is just a prototype so we

362
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,990
only deal with lineage in the mushroom

363
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,389
learning algorithm so the motion is

364
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,680
model will call the lineage and also the

365
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,360
result and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the limit we are</font>

366
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,979
currently talking about we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't deal</font>

367
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,449
with other stuff without actually our

368
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,370
future work so why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit a bigger</font>

369
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,939
systems and just talking the motion

370
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,800
running talk ok thanks thank you

371
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,709
interesting work I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question it</font>

372
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,479
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like in some of your discussions</font>

373
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:38,989
you assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know which data you</font>

374
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,410
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unlearn but in some of the use</font>

375
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases you may not know what what</font>

376
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,000
happened you know princess<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the case</font>

377
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,269
of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam example yeah yeah you don't</font>

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,120
know when the tampering yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

379
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:54,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">a great question so yeah that's right</font>

380
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,269
like for some of them we know for

381
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,399
example like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private data information</font>

382
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:00,769
we know that the user specified which

383
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,290
seems to unlearn someone like spam we

384
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:06,709
don't know but we say this like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal</font>

385
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,449
approach that like more precise for

386
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,640
example a human billion going to label

387
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,770
all set her as like okay this is

388
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,929
mislabeled data and actually have some

389
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,740
actually some huge future working mind

390
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:20,900
called adaptive act called active motion

391
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,419
on learning we try to probe which they

392
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,030
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlearn so again it's a great</font>

393
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,949
question so country is just a saga know

394
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:33,470
and I haven't solved that yet yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

395
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:35,929
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so then I so I took a look at</font>

396
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,179
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have a lot of evaluations of</font>

397
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:41,240
these real-world systems you have any

398
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,860
impression for us of how much was work

399
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,510
to do specifically to get it to work

400
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,149
with zazo specifically to get it work

401
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,100
with one system versus how much was

402
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,440
work that was generalizable to any

403
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,020
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used for unlearning</font>

404
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,550
mm-hmm so for to do the unlearning we

405
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,320
need to convert you to summation form

406
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,480
for example take like lens kit for

407
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,189
example we need to get is normalized

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,080
cosine similarity and convert it to a

409
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,060
summation form and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

410
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,550
introduce additional layer summation

411
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,830
layer and we modify the landscape and of

412
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,780
code actually and I need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

413
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,610
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot the number is very less I</font>

414
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,879
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like a less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than like a two</font>

415
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,320
percent of the line of code like a 0.2

416
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,440
percent of the line of code which

417
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,220
modified cool thank you let's thank the

418
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,220
speaker one more time
