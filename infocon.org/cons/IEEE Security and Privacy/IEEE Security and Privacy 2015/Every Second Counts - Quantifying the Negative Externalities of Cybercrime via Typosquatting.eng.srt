hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I'm Mohammed aha and</font>

00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,790
today I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about the</font>

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,889
negative externalities of type of

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,908
squatting so this work was primer

5
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:16,250
primarily done at UIC<font color="#E5E5E5"> with young our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">chris can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> h so speaking of cyber crime</font>

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,740
in general the main focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the</font>

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,740
detection and removal of malicious bugs

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,959
in software and code meanwhile other

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,809
research aspects of cybersecurity also

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,620
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economic analysis to</font>

13
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:38,599
investigate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xss of cyber criminals</font>

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,660
but the real question is that why is

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,940
this important while the ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal</font>

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,339
behind is to provide convenience to

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,129
users and minimize the harm caused by

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,260
these kinds of breaches now it is

19
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,480
essential to realize that harm is not

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,449
just monetary but can also take the form

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of wasted effort and a loss of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font>

22
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,718
time like other cyber crimes one of the

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">common from the cyber crimes is type of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">squatting the attacker model works in</font>

25
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,000
such a way that users with malicious I

mean individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> with malicious intent</font>

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be titled by users and the next step</font>

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that they host either advertisements</font>

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,790
malware or even sometimes competing

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,320
content on the following websites now

33
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,420
let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an example here a tablet</font>

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,259
how typo squatting causes a loss of

removing the antivirus know how our

44
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,750
previous studies have shown that malware

00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,740
another aspect of harm that this

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime entails let's look at an</font>

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:13,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">example here to evaluate on this now Bob</font>

50
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,010
here wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to facebook.com</font>

51
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,880
accidentally miss types and he reaches

<font color="#CCCCCC">at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FA ec d double</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok calm now what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,350
he do he sees an error page he realizes

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,560
made a mistake he corrects his mistake

55
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:34,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now he's on facebook</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now let's</font>

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider the case I'm sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

57
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,340
yeah so now let's consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case when</font>

58
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,530
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arriving at facebook.com/ in</font>

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,500
seeing an error page Bob saw something

60
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,360
like that looked like this now if he

61
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,650
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough internet education</font>

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,459
he's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fall for this</font>

63
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,720
fishing site and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see that</font>

64
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,790
this is a survey he's going to fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,040
out and in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> case we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

66
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,670
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a user loss for</font>

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,440
facebook com however if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> does realize</font>

68
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,559
that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fishing site and he does</font>

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,750
go eventually go to facebook.com there's

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,140
an extra amount of time consumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

71
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,420
whole process<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we define the delta T</font>

72
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,820
here does the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

73
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,589
additional time consumed as a result of

type of squatting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss typing as</font>

75
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,260
initially the time that is lost due to

76
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,200
type of squatting itself and the fact

77
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,989
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to FAS ebook com followed</font>

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,839
by facebook com allows us to infer

79
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,180
intent that user wanted with it facebook

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,570
com within the initial wizard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

81
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,519
use as our user intent model now these

82
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,260
are some of the motivations that help us

83
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,269
study type of squatting we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

84
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,790
type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> scarring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is big and because we</font>

85
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,260
see like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these organizations</font>

86
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,179
invest into defensive registrations and

87
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,250
these brand protection websites such as

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,410
markmonitor have a have an active

89
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,450
presence apart from that it's also

90
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,209
natural for users to keep on making

91
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:03,350
typos and this motivates these type of

92
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,850
squatters to gain from this type of

93
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,920
squatting is also feasible to study

94
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,320
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's observable within passive</font>

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,149
network data and because we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a</font>

96
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,130
visit to a cybercriminal website

97
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,440
followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the legitimate website</font>

98
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,930
within the passive data this essentially

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,120
allows us to infer intent and see how

100
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,070
much time it took the user to actually

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,070
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intended destination website</font>

102
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,520
our work focuses on<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

next represent a harm quantification

analysis on a more broader scale whereas

114
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,299
our work is a more open methodology with

115
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:03,390
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine-grained measurements let's</font>

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,180
look at a quick at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sets to do</font>

117
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,250
develop some context so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had three</font>

118
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,210
main passive data sources that included

119
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTTP data logs from a university</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS logs between the recursive resolver</font>

121
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,360
and the internet from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same network</font>

122
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,690
and proxy data from an enterprise

123
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,120
solution for active sources we use a

124
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,310
high fidelity crawler to observe

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,470
redirects for all the prospective typo

126
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,060
domains and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> when our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font>

127

forms of data collection during this

128
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,770
research so by looking at these<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

129
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets our main</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goal is to extract</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

130
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,630
pairs by evaluating user intent we do

131
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,330
this essentially by leveraging on the

132
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,760
user's continued intention to visit the

133
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,140
actual destination website even<font color="#CCCCCC"> after he</font>

134
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,480
has been a victim to tell Joe squatting

135
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,450
now this intention can be fulfilled<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

136
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,780
many ways we refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as discovery</font>

137
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,710
methods so some of the discovery method

138
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,020
includes searching for the target<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain</font>

139
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,239
correcting a URL mistake in the URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar</font>

140
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,950
or either going to it through other

141
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,530
sources that might include clicking on

142
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:15,300
ads or browsing it on hyperlink so we

143
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,539
can use our intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> in intuition to</font>

144
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,000
quantify user intent by using the

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,800
conditional probability model we apply

146

we see that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much similar</font>

293
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:53,370
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two those providers that also</font>

294
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,379
provide domain parking services now this

295
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is an unsurprising result</font>

296
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:00,779
because mainly the monetization and

297
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,870
advertisement techniques within typo

298
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:09,720
squatting are pretty much similar to

299
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:14,250
domain parking now looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loss</font>

300
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,660
of revenue we need to convert<font color="#CCCCCC"> to for to</font>

301
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,189
form a basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of comparison we</font>

302
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,839
essentially need to convert the<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative</font>

303
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:22,140
externalities of lost users and

304
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,840
loss of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time into actual dollar amount</font>

305
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,430
now we do this by<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so let me explain</font>

306
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,410
negative externality because it's an

307
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,359
economic term so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our context negative</font>

308
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,189
externality here essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that</font>

309
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,590
the loss incurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the site owner as</font>

310
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">well as the users who intended to go to</font>

311
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:42,900
the website in opposed to the gains of

312
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,730
the type of squatter so looking at the

313
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,490
intended site owner has a negative

314
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,400
externality ratio of 18 to 1 against the

315
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,980
type of scholar now essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

316
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,870
other word this means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a one</font>

317
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,170
dollar gained by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of scatter the</font>

318
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,510
site owner lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 dollars of revenue</font>

319
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,520
now it's also important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider the</font>

320
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,220
loss of users that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are browsing the web</font>

321
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">sites and by using per capita income and</font>

322
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,630
the average delay times we boil down to

323
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">a number of 29 29 cents that is lost due</font>

324
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,870
to type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> squatting per year we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

325
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,300
evaluate the defender ratio that comes

326
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,360
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be four point two six two is 21</font>

327
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:29,490
which is far lower than the negative

328
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,490
externality ratio of<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-violent crimes</font>

329
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,790
in conclusion I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that</font>

330
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,350
type of squatting is much less socially

331
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,870
damaging because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has low negative</font>

332
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:45,250
externality ratio in comparison to other

333
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:47,980
forms of cyber crime that include spam

334
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,090
and phishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and defensive registrations</font>

335
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:54,280
we see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data set that do provide</font>

336
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,710
users get faster to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website but that</font>

337
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,630
is essentially a consequence of the

338
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">users mistyping rather than typo</font>

339
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,980
spotting and because the delays between

340
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,290
the mistype domains and adversarial

341
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,720
domains are not significantly different

342
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,819
well we can pretty much say that typo

343
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,160
squatting is here to stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

344
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,260
unlikely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a technical or policy</font>

345
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,079
intervention will substantially increase

346
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,480
the quality of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life of the users that</font>

347
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:24,100
are browsing unless that intervention

348
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,550
also takes care of users<font color="#CCCCCC"> active</font>

349
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,020
mistyping as well as type of spotting so

350
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,140
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much and I'll take</font>

any questions I've been asking this

354
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,819
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for decades why does anybody</font>

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,900
URL into the address bar yeah is a very

360
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,479
inefficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of conveying that</font>

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:26,310
by your browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> history so how often do</font>

people actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to type in a URL</font>

365
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,520
also I would like answer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

366
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,140
that whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go to the</font>

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:39,310
and type it i mean that's that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

much room for policy intervention to

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,210
help victims yeah I wouldn't definitely

387
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:58,230
agree with that and I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

388

this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a one form of future</font>

of fishing in which you you mentioned in

392
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,400
for Korea I mean this data said was like

393
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:13,080
really based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a u.s. University so our</font>

hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> kami vanier Indiana University this</font>

397
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:24,270
is mildly a follow-up I guess in the

398
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,129
prior question but I'm curious how much

399
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,870
you know the source of the typo error

400
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,550
like whether they were clicking on a

401
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,500
link whether you're actually looking

402
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:35,730
potentially a bit rot because we do see

403

some problems sometimes a CMU<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add-ons like the</font>

435
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:53,640
example i mentioned that NHL and NFL

436
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:56,280
like how do these add-ons differentiate

437
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,020
between if this is a legit typo or its

438
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,510
or are these two

439
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,879
similar websites lexically similar

440
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,160
websites that just appeared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

441
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,930
directly and related it's like how would

442
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that add-on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they typically look</font>

443
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,840
at like the most like the top hundred or

444
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,810
thousand websites and if what you've

445
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,500
typed in is within like some distance of

446
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:21,450
that website's name they will brought up

447
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,310
a alert sign that say like are you sure

448
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to go or</font>

449
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,929
is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual website I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

450
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,730
that more time<font color="#E5E5E5"> consuming we haven't like</font>

451
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered these add-ons but it would be</font>

452
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that okay or do these</font>

453
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,810
add-ons that they provide users with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

454
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,180
list of possible websites it's pretty

455
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,909
much like searching a thing they type in

456
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,530
and the add-on pops up and I haven't

457
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">used them but if that's what they do</font>

458
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,250
they pop up and like give a list to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

459
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,900
users it's pretty much like going to

460
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,540
google and typing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> main and then</font>

461
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,400
more giving a list they just if you're

462
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,600
if it's just like one character

463
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,240
difference where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm from a major</font>

464
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">website they just bring up a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> science and</font>

465
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,230
say like this is what you typed this are

466
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,480
you sure you don't want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it I'm</font>

467
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,790
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube instead of you tape or</font>

468
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,440
something else well I know just

469
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested that would that would be well</font>

470
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,150
an example but like there might be some

471
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,220
false positives within this add-on

472
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,830
because like again I'm being redundant

473
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,870
but like NHL and NFL are both popular

474
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,520
websites and the reason I'm referring

475
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,320
them is that they're they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> present</font>

476
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,240
in the data set and I wouldn't know like

477
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,860
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would that add-on treat these two</font>

478
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,210
websites okay thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

479
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,209
much let's thank the speaker again
