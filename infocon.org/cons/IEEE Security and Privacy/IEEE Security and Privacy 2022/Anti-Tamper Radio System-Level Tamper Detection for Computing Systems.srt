1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,560
thanks for the introduction again and i

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,040
will um still reintroduce myself once

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,279
again just to make sure that uh maybe

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
someone in the online audience or some

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
folks that have joined

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
will make sure um to get my introduction

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
so my name is paul start and i am with

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,039
the max planck institute for security

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
and privacy

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,640
and in this talk i present our paper um

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,119
anti-tamper radio system level tempo

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,599
detection for computing systems

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,519
and um this is a joint work with my

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,519
co-authors johannes toolbit who is here

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,679
by the way today as well

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,800
christian senger and christophe parr and

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
this was within a collaboration with the

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
bochum-based

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
company firesight

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,680
so adversaries with physical access to

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079
devices can launch

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,760
physical attacks

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
and this allows attackers

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,440
to extract their information or implant

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,079
malicious functionality

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
out of or into devices

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
and for example an attacker could

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
attempt to

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680
read out cryptographic key material or

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
or into intellectual property

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,200
so

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
the tool case for such attacks includes

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,600
for example

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
uh site channel analysis bus probing

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
or fault injection to just name a few

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
and to counter such attacks system

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
designers can add temporary detection

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,079
mechanisms to respond to attacks

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,799
and this would then trigger some sort of

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,520
say self-destruction such as the wiping

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,159
of all of the critical information

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,720
contained in the devices

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,240
so there are already various

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
tamper detection mechanisms which have

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
different protection scopes

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
and on the chip level we have seen

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
capacitive coatings on the ic surface or

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,520
wire meshes on silicon to prevent actual

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
micro probing

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
on the module level

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,119
entire pcbs such as pci express cards

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,479
are protected

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
and for instance hardware security

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
modules are typically enclosed within an

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,640
actively

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,360
monitored security envelope and this

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
then forms a security boundary around

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
the module

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
and the third level is the system level

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,520
and

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
there are several components which work

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
together

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
and unfortunately however on the system

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
level um

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,319
temporary detection is an unsolved

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,200
problem so there are there are today no

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
no high security solutions to this

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
and therefore in our paper we introduced

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
the anti-temper radio or short the atr

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
which uses radio waves to detect

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,959
physical tempering

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,280
so we add antennas to the environment to

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
be monitored

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
and then we transmit a signal from one

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
antenna to the other

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
so as the signal propagates it is

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
reflected within the environment and

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,640
thus

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
when the environment changes

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
so do the received signals

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
so by analyzing the received signals we

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,239
then can check the environment's

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,720
physical integrity to make

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
to to then

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
trigger like the the tamper response

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,000
so this wireless approach uh enables the

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
system level detection even within

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
complex geometries and thus the approach

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
which we here pursue

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
is very flexible and sometimes can even

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,319
be retrofitted to existing devices

92
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
so moreover because of the detection

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
mechanism is not based

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,599
on damaging a security boundary it

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,399
further is even re-initializable

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
so how does one

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
systematically evaluate a temporary

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
detection mechanism

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
and that's actually a tough question

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
because

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
it's impossible to cover all the attack

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,280
vectors

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
and we decided to use needle probing

104
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
as an exemplary attack vector to

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
evaluate

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
and we believe because when we can

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,280
detect a small probing needle we believe

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
that we are also likely to detect other

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
more invasive tempering as well

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,519
so we prepared test enclosures

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
where we drilled small holes into their

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,240
lids and in these holes we can insert

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
the probing needles

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
and

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
further we added two antennas in the

116
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,960
environment to measure the radio

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
propagation behavior in the environment

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,320
and because we did not want to do all of

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
the tampering by hand we used a

120
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,960
cartesian robot to position the needles

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
in a repeatable manner for us

122
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
so this is what the setup looks like

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,880
and this is also the experimental setup

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
which we have used in the paper to

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
gather all the results which we report

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,638
there

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
so to measure the radio propagation

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,280
behavior in the test environment we use

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,919
a so called vector network analyzer and

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,479
this measurement instrument gives us the

131
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
frequency domain transfer function in

132
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,120
the gigahertz signal range so on the

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,039
right hand side

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,520
we see an excerpt from such a transfer

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
function and basically what it shows

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
is that

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
how much the transmitted signal

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
is attenuated over frequency

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
due to the environment dependent signal

140
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
propagation

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
so now when we insert the probing needle

142
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
into the environment

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
the environment or the transfer function

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,840
will slightly change and

145
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
it is this change which we leverage here

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,520
as a temper detector mechanism

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,759
so to assess the environment state we

148
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,520
use the so-called mean normalized

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
deviation

150
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,560
as a metric to quantify the similarity

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
between two measurements between two of

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
these transfer functions and it gives us

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,479
a scalar value

154
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
between zero and one and the value

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,759
increases with greater dissimilarity of

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,199
the

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,520
of the measurements

158
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,919
so at the very beginning of our

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,440
experiments

160
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
we used an empty aluminum box

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
as an idealized test environment and

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,479
using this box we addressed our

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,039
fundamental research question

164
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
can we detect submillimeter metallic

165
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
needles using radio waves

166
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,280
and

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,360
based on our results we can answer this

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
question positively

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,840
so here we see that the m d

170
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,680
increases as we

171
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,319
as we increase the needle diameter or as

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
we insert in the needle deeper into the

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,319
environment

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
so the key takeaway from this slide is

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,880
that we are

176
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
able to detect the needle insertion

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,800
and second that the detectability

178
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,199
rises with the physical extent of the

179
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,840
tampering

180
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,759
so having shown that needle detection

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
in principle is possible

182
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
we then went to a real world

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,479
case study which is a fully functional

184
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,240
19-inch server

185
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
so here we see the lid of the server

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
which we prepared for the needle probing

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
by drilling holes into it and this is

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
what the servo looks on the inside

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
and we can see a number of fans

190
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,319
the cpu and the power supply here and

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,080
further we then added

192
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
the two antennas for the anti-tamper

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,599
radio

194
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
and these antennas are located in the

195
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,080
main board chamber of the of the server

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
and then when then we went ahead and

197
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,720
measured the atr response when inserting

198
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
the probing needle at all the available

199
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
positions of the server

200
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
so this heat map shows the impact of the

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
needle insertion on the atr measurements

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,440
and we can see that the needle causes

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,919
stronger signal variation close to the

204
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,039
antennas

205
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,520
so this result is expected

206
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
because the server is partitioned in

207
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,080
various chambers

208
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,400
which are separated by metallic walls

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
and because of this separation

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
the signal coverage throughout the

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
server

212
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
as a precondition for for the needle

213
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,280
detection

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,160
is rather limited to the region around

215
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,919
the antennas

216
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,599
and thus based on the service

217
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,319
partitioning we define a sensitive and

218
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
an insensitive region

219
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
in this experiment by the way the server

220
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,279
was turned off

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
and

222
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,120
when we turned the server on this

223
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
affects the measurement severely so when

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,719
we turn the server on there is airflow

225
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,880
there is vibration there is significant

226
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
temperature swings due to cpu load

227
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,160
variations

228
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
and

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,760
we can already see here from these from

230
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
these

231
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,920
m d curve that that it

232
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,640
that it perturbs the the measurement

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800
because there is some dissimilarity

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
indicated

235
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,560
so the question now is how does

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,600
this

237
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
noise affect the detectability of the

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
needle

239
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,399
so to provide an answer to this we use

240
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,200
the following experimental procedure

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,519
so we start at the very beginning

242
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
to take an initial reference measurement

243
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
and

244
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
and subsequently we then compare all of

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
the

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
subsequent measurements to this initial

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
reference

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,279
and then at all positions of the

249
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
sensitive region

250
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,640
we then gather measurements with the

251
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,600
needle

252
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
being outside and with the needle being

253
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
inside

254
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
and each point in the plot

255
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
shows the the median of the m d across

256
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,800
the sensitive region

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
and the color grading indicates the

258
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,839
distribution of the m d

259
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,200
so then we vary the cpu load and repeat

260
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,160
the entire process

261
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,920
so in blue we see the system's behavior

262
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
when we repeat this entire procedure for

263
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,959
a period of 10 days

264
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,800
so this is basically the system's

265
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,560
response when it is untempered so now

266
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
when we insert the needle it is in a

267
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
tempered state

268
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
and this is what the orange lines here

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
show

270
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
and unfortunately when we select the

271
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,959
threshold to not produce any false

272
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,839
positives when we select the threshold

273
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
just above the legitimate state

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,760
we were only able to detect around 50 of

275
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
the sensitive region and the question

276
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
now is

277
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
how can we

278
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
restore the detectability of the needle

279
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,399
despite these variations

280
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,160
to resolve this we introduce a setup

281
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,000
phase at the initialization of the atr

282
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,079
so

283
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
we begin with monitoring the untempered

284
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,440
environment during the setup

285
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,279
and we then

286
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,680
detect spectral regions with high signal

287
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,079
variations this is during the signal and

288
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
during the during the setup phase where

289
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,959
we look at how the the atr response of

290
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,600
the radio measurement system behaves

291
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
when there is no insertion of a needle

292
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
just because of the variation of the

293
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,000
server

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,010
and

295
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,399
[Music]

296
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,279
then

297
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,360
after identification of these regions we

298
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,920
then disregard these identified regions

299
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,640
during the deployment of the atr

300
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
so by doing so

301
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,200
we can now see that the two classes

302
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
of

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
untemperate environment and the

304
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,800
temperate environment with a needle

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,399
insertion

306
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
are actually now very much

307
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
distinguishable

308
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
so this result was

309
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,360
obtained with a rather expansive network

310
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
analyzer as i've mentioned before and

311
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,360
when we again set the threshold to not

312
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,839
yield any false positives

313
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
we arrive at detecting 114 out of 117

314
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,519
positions in the sensitive region that's

315
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,399
about 97

316
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
so the question now was can we also

317
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,600
reduce the cost of this measurement

318
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,959
system because we don't want the

319
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
measurement system to be more expensive

320
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
than the actual uh target that we try to

321
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
protect

322
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
and yes we can

323
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,519
we actually implemented this system

324
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
using a set of low cost single chip

325
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,279
ultra wideband transceiver chips

326
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
and we use these chips to extract the

327
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
channel impulse response

328
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,839
and

329
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,399
using this cheap setup which is only at

330
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
two times five us dollars

331
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
we detect at least 90 out of 170

332
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,839
positions has 17 positions which is

333
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,519
around 80

334
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
um

335
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
of course these results can be further

336
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
improved but this is only a preliminary

337
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
study and we currently work on improving

338
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,279
or

339
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
investigating further measurement

340
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,040
systems and

341
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,279
there's still room for improvement but

342
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,519
of course we can see that the expensive

343
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,079
measurement system sets the baseline to

344
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,560
show that the detection is possible

345
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
using radio waves and that is actually a

346
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
viable detection mechanism even in real

347
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
world conditions

348
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,200
okay so this slide concludes the talk we

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,279
have introduced the anti-temper radio

350
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,800
short atr

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,639
as a radio wave based temporary

352
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,959
detection mechanism and this allows

353
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
system level tamper detection

354
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,000
we have demonstrated the hdr deployment

355
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
in a running 19-inch server and this

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,279
server had fans cpu load variation and

357
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
temperature swings and still we were

358
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,800
able to

359
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
demonstrate long-term stable needle

360
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
detection over a period of

361
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
at least 10 days

362
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
and finally

363
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
we have shown that this system can also

364
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
be implemented using low-cost

365
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
commodity measurement systems thank you

366
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,920
very much and i'm happy to take

367
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,319
questions

368
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,199
we have time for questions

369
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
let's go mike

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,480
hello uh it's great talk uh

371
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,639
i was wondering uh

372
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,040
does the

373
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,680
does the the material of

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
like the needle in this case it's like

375
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,800
some form of a metal or alloy does the

376
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
material what happens when the material

377
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
changes

378
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,839
um

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,839
in in our paper we have investigated

380
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,560
only different needles or like needles

381
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
of different diameter and only metallic

382
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
needles

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,959
and um we are aware that there are some

384
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
or we have also discussed some cases in

385
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,800
the paper where

386
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
the attacker could use non-metallic

387
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
needles but in the case of of probing

388
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,519
say like probing an act an actual

389
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
connection on the pcb a metallic needle

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,480
would be required of course um

391
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
to to to

392
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,320
because of the conductivity and

393
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
non-conductive materials for instance

394
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,160
say which which are low loss rf

395
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,199
materials um on plastic these would also

396
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,560
be transparent to the to the atr um

397
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
this is at least what we believe we had

398
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,399
not yet conducted studies on this but we

399
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
are in the progress of of preparing for

400
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
the um experiments

401
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,240
uh where we will investigate this as

402
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
well um

403
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,639
but

404
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,920
yeah

405
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
to conclude we have we have not

406
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,839
experimented with other

407
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,800
materials okay uh

408
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,920
just one more uh so uh yeah that

409
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,079
thanks for that um

410
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,199
and uh

411
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,000
like the the attack scenario that you

412
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,519
are envisioning

413
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,920
um so like because very specifically

414
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,680
needles were used so i'm wondering it's

415
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
like uh if somebody's doing probing on

416
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
the circuit board what what what is the

417
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,839
what is the sort of thing you're

418
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,040
thinking of

419
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
um there are actually

420
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
actual reports where where people have

421
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
probed bus lines on

422
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
on laptops for instance to

423
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,000
to eave drop on on the connection to tpm

424
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
and extract

425
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,160
dpm key keys from a tpm and then

426
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
circumvent

427
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,199
like hard disk encryptions for instance

428
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,079
so there are various various

429
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
like attacks that that are based on on

430
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,160
physical access

431
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,839
but of course we do not consider a

432
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,800
specific threat in in here okay

433
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,120
the the needle insertion is just a

434
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
like next templary attack vector

435
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,639
thank you

436
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
so i have a couple questions too uh the

437
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
error rates for like the 80

438
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
is that fixed so like the same location

439
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,360
can consistently

440
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,079
evade detection or is it uh there's some

441
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,160
variance in terms of

442
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,920
the adversaries perspective

443
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
there there is some variance the

444
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,839
detectability is affected by a couple of

445
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
factors so at first we have the um like

446
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
the variance of the untempered state so

447
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
this is basically the

448
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,839
like all of the noise components so this

449
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,040
is on the one hand this is the

450
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,320
measurement noise of the measurement

451
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,920
system and then there is the noise of

452
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
the environment say because of the

453
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,760
environmental variation as as i've shown

454
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,199
here

455
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,039
so these are the noise components which

456
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,799
would affect the false positive

457
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
performance

458
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,119
and then there is the physical effect of

459
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
the needle insertion on the radio signal

460
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
propagation and this is actually fixed

461
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,599
um when the environment does not change

462
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,919
the the needle detection impact will

463
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,520
also not change it's more the problem

464
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
with the with a legitimate

465
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
environment very

466
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,799
but there are various ways around this

467
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,880
you could for instance also change

468
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
like the measurement the frequency range

469
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
of the measurement because when you when

470
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
you reduce the bandwidth of the

471
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
measurement you will also gather less

472
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
information from the environment but if

473
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
you increase the bandwidth of your

474
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
entire system you will also harvest more

475
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
information from the environment which

476
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,200
would then

477
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
potentially boost the detection

478
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
performance again

479
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,400
right from the so if you actually change

480
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
if the location of the radio i mean i'm

481
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,160
wondering from an advertisement they can

482
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
figure out where

483
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
to insert that is a blind spot uh that

484
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
would be the case right um that's

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
actually that's a really good question

486
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
because um that needs to be modeled

487
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,520
beforehand and we envisioned this to to

488
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,320
to um to complement with a setup phase

489
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,559
where vendors for instance would would

490
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
verify that that the system coverage is

491
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
given you could for instance we are

492
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,480
currently

493
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,559
also collaborating with some partners

494
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,400
where we simulate the the needle

495
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,039
detection like in full fields um wave

496
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,240
simulations

497
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,200
and um to to to predict where the needle

498
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,520
and detection is given but yeah that's

499
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
that's actually a good question and the

500
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
system designer of course needs to

501
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
ensure that the

502
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,760
anti-temporary circuitry is

503
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
located within the sensitive region to

504
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,720
be self-protected as well

505
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
is there time oh yes there is yes please

506
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
quick question uh so for the low-cost

507
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,039
uwb chips how do you power those

508
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,360
so for the ultra-wide chips yeah on the

509
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,240
uh

510
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,919
what was the question exactly like how

511
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,679
do you i'm just curious about your setup

512
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,480
like how do you do you power them

513
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
how do you power them and i have a

514
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
subsequent question like should if you

515
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
were to add multiple of them would that

516
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,120
make the problem the detection problem

517
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
easier rather than having two yeah

518
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
yeah four yeah that's a nice nice

519
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
excellent remark um

520
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,120
this is also something that we that we

521
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
briefly discuss in the paper because

522
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
when we when we position more uh devices

523
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,320
in the in the environment um

524
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
then we also would gain more detection

525
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,840
path yeah so um so we would have then

526
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
when we when we placed multiple antennas

527
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
in the environment we would gain

528
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,440
multiple um connections which we could

529
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
monitor like even

530
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,400
in parallel

531
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
to um to monitor the environment and and

532
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
extend the sensitive region so to say

533
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
and my first question how do you power

534
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,280
them in the so in the server

535
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
do they are they battery power do you

536
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
put batteries there or how does it yeah

537
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,000
actually um

538
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
to elaborate on on our experimental

539
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,559
setup a bit um we relocated the

540
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,480
measurement systems on the outside of

541
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
the test environments so um so in the

542
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
setup they would be

543
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,679
they could be battery powered um

544
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
or you could you could also power them

545
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,240
from from the server security as well

546
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
but uh but for our experiments like for

547
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,799
just for simplicity we

548
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,960
we used cables to connect them

549
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,799
yeah i mean you can imagine

550
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,240
in the future building motherboards that

551
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
come with these things built inside of

552
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,159
them so that they you give them to them

553
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:34,880
okay

554
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,600
thank you thank you very much

555
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
oh that's great why don't we uh thank

556
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,320
paul again two great cups
