00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,280
hello everyone welcome to nintendo of

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,080
topic it's a little kid for us not here

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,919
in pennsylvania but we're still glad to

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,800
share our presentation smile secure

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
memory introspection for life and live

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we are three awesome lay and fun way

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
from the southern university of science

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
and technology chihuahua from the

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,519
singapore management university

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,199
first of all we released the outnumber

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,119
of this presentation and we will

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,760
introduce the motivation or revenue

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,399
design and evolution of the smell and

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,399
finally we'll conclude this project

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,800
for a general question why island level

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,239
introspection needed since sds provides

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,879
a user-level trusted environment for

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,960
security sensitive code and data

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
execution the angle owner proves to

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,239
introspect the runtime level for various

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
goals

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,239
for example analyzing the reason of the

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
crash or locate the error execution or

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
debug the country flow or verify the

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
runtime state

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,159
in summary the only one to understand

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,400
what has hype is enclave

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
but why is it hard to introspect

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
enclaves

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
there are many reasons it is invasive to

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
introspect thank you memory by using the

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
traditional memory introspection

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,640
approach

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
because the intestines enclave is the

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
black box

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
the angular memory cannot be accessed

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
from outside

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,880
another reason is the users can load and

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,439
conditionally trust the safe report made

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,799
from the unclear inside introspection

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
that's because the unclear with under

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,320
serious attacks the external attack and

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
the internal attack and left code were

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,240
abilities exposed by effect and left

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,640
code execution

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,040
finally the user can not determine which

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
angle and epc page belongs to

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,560
and because the target os is the

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
untrusted state

50
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
the adversary can use the same unclear

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
image and launch it in a magnificent

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
computer

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,840
among the untrusted host

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
attacks and code box or isolation from

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
the sds reporting

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,480
the user cannot identify the authority

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,680
of the uncle and also cannot verify the

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
journalists of the result

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
so in summary a powerful advisory can

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
easily spoil the introspection

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,079
so we will propose our skin smell

62
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,319
as mentioned before

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
samara is a short for the secure memory

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
introspection for level enclave to

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
address their bowel challenges this male

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
needs to

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,400
meet the foreign assurances

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
first

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
we need to assume that uncle level are

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
statistics that means the introspection

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
issued up on the expected rank layout

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
then we need to issue the introspection

73
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
generally that means the introspection

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,879
results should be true and not affected

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,840
by graph and lab code

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
finally when you teach you the security

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
place dealing

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,360
that means the id introspection should

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
not undermine the therefore unclear

80
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
security

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,959
then with about three principles this

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
now is desired to ensure the owner of an

83
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
enclave and only the owner retrieves her

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
enclave contents at runtime

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
we design the smell on the hardware

86
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,159
platform

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,040
is

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,040
x86 based device with smm and sds

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
hardware features

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
in most of the interest view

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,798
the functions are built-in

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
we will give some background of the sdx

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
and smm

94
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,599
sjs tcp along is insufficient for the

95
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
memory introspection and as sts neither

96
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,080
deals with the ankle left software

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
compromise nor supports the runtime

98
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,239
payment

99
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,439
but s7 wants an independent execution

100
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,560
environment

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,358
once the core switch from the product

102
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,279
model to smm it will hunt and restore

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
the host applications

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
the smi can access the normal memory in

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
a high privilege without relying on the

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
untrust oas that means the xml has

107
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
ability to control the ankle level

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
execution environment

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
with this manual the user can securely

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
introspect the takadank layout with the

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,720
following workflow first unclear owner

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
sends the introspection request to the

113
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
target platform

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
and the target always passes the

115
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,759
reference to the same agent then the sm

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,919
engine launched the small session to

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,720
verify the angular inner introspection

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
code

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
finally the angle requests and passes

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
the request memory to the owner

121
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,919
the asm engineer's responsibility is to

122
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,479
authenticate the enclave and they sense

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,080
the trustworthiness of their

124
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
introspection called young lab

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,639
with them propose our basic idea of the

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,759
smell

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,880
their approach of the summer is that the

128
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,080
sm engine also declared that a german

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
enclave and the established trust on a

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
piece the code in enclave the trusted

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,400
code then reports the angle of contents

132
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,759
to the owner to support the approach

133
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,919
when it builds the confined integration

134
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,880
scheme

135
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
for anti-level authentication and the

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,199
trust establishment

137
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
the scheme is similar to the software

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,479
testation to get the chair of the trans

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,680
like this

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
first we use the anchor to verify the

141
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
working then work to verify the angular

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,440
identity firmly with the trusted working

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
enclave there to introspect that request

144
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,600
memory

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
the tcp of the smell is the union of the

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
therefore the tsp is for sdx and for smm

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,400
the angle of security still depends on

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
the sjs tcp and the sm engine does not

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
get enclave contents or weak the

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
security of the sdx

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,319
next

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
we'll introduce the details of how to

153
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
design the smell

154
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
there are two parts to build the main

155
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
function of the smell

156
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,039
first we deploy the interrogation agent

157
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,639
into the smm called sm engine the sm

158
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
engineer is to build the confined

159
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
environment engine for their inspection

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
and passes the signature for

161
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
introspection without encryption

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
next we add the introspection code into

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
angular named ancestry and this reader

164
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,639
has the encode for trustable striping

165
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
and the work at station and also have

166
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
the work code for unclear identity

167
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,440
checking and memory introspection

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
so we introduce the workflow of this

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,759
mail

170
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,400
the steps in like this first smile set

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
up the interrogation session between the

172
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
same engine and the angus reader to

173
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,560
execute the confined environment

174
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
protocol and next

175
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
the verified work dumps the request to

176
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
the epc page to the owner with the

177
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,639
equation

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
to support the confined integration

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
protocol we need to set up the confined

180
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
environment with two steps

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
the first step is to control the system

182
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
status of the cpu course

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,479
the issue

184
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,120
one core runs in the lab code in

185
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
protocol model and the remain states in

186
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,879
sma

187
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,039
and another step is to restrict the

188
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
angular execution memory space

189
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,879
as the finger shows that unclear can

190
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,759
only run the anchor page on the access

191
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,360
page and outputs the data to the pi page

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,639
to understand the confined integration

193
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,599
protocol to know the anchor code is the

194
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,800
smallest executable that can retain the

195
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
expected random banks when running in

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
the confined environment with restricted

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,599
the memory storage engine posture leads

198
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,080
to a more bites for execution and

199
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,559
therefore cannot retain the expected

200
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
random bites

201
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,479
to achieve that level association there

202
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,120
are three step cheek checking

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
including the ongoing integrate worker

204
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
integrate and unclear identity

205
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
we first introduced the anchor integrity

206
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
checking anchor is the first piece of

207
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,360
the code to run in the integration and

208
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
the remain space firmly fills with the

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
random batch to against the legal

210
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,399
instruction injection the anchor

211
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,959
attempts the ssa and anchor page data to

212
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,000
the shared buffer the html agent in

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
interrogation core will verify the

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
dumping data after passing the

215
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,480
verification the anchor becomes the

216
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
first very first trusted foothold in

217
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,360
that lab for subscriber verifications

218
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,040
and next after the anchor is trusted

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,600
then the sm engine will release the

220
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
restriction of the worker page

221
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,399
and the ancestry goes to

222
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
dump the work page data to the shared

223
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
buffer

224
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
so the sms agent do the summary

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
operation to verify the dumping code

226
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,760
from dumping data from network

227
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
i've checked the anchor and work code

228
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
the sm engine released the eps database

229
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,279
used for the unclear report generation

230
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
and then the worker excludes their

231
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
e-report instructions to generate its

232
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,560
report

233
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,279
and the workers were going to return the

234
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,240
mrn claire from the report to the sheer

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
buffer

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
if the identity matched in the sm engine

237
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
the engine has successfully

238
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,600
authenticated the enclave without using

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
therefore sdx local or remote

240
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,240
attestation

241
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
once we verify the general enclave

242
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,160
the sm engine will pass the request and

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,720
the signature should enclave and release

244
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
all enclave memory available

245
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
then the work introspects or requested

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,399
memory and passes the self-test to the

247
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,720
owner as i mentioned there will turn

248
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,560
down the confined environment and the

249
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,880
terminal to the itas mirror excision

250
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
with received the introspection result

251
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,440
the owner will verify the signature to

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
confirm the journalists of the

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,920
introspection result

254
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,079
then we'll give some test case to show

255
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,079
the performance and the effectiveness of

256
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,880
the smell

257
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
here we show the test bed for our

258
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,399
experiment

259
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
the plant form is consensual with the

260
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,120
gigabyte moth board and the intel f5 cpu

261
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,800
this view is supports the sdx and the s7

262
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,839
hardware features we use the ubuntu for

263
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,160
the operating system and we store the

264
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
intel extra sdx sdk the vision is the

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,399
2.5

266
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
after the experiment we will get the our

267
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
head for each session of the scenario

268
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,880
inspection

269
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
in generally

270
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,480
they'll take

271
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,320
116 microseconds for the zero load

272
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
interrogation session and another 120

273
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,519
mega seconds for the ic equation it also

274
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,959
takes 2.1 microseconds for one page asc

275
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,480
equation for mpeg task the world costs

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
similarly ahead

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,920
to improve the performance when needed

278
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,279
to do some

279
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,920
improvement to reduce the equipment

280
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
for example to share the aes king and

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
material sessions with one ton i say

282
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,200
once we can choose the ask in a secret

283
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,079
state

284
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
it will have a lot of stable performance

285
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
improvement

286
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
after merit test case we can find the

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,320
suitable scenario for the smell is the

288
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
application functionality and the

289
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
security demand

290
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,240
over here always the performance

291
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
considerations

292
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
and also the applications who want to

293
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
require the enclave's rental information

294
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,240
for for instance or debugging purpose

295
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
we have been studied the four test cases

296
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,760
to show the effectiveness of the smell

297
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
including the coating in great chicken

298
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,480
excess study checking style checking and

299
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
unclear location verification in those

300
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
cases we use the smell to copy out the

301
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
corresponding angle memory data called

302
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
ssj

303
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,560
stack and shear key

304
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
we use the stack checking as an example

305
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
we first launched an rop tag up on

306
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,639
experimentate enclave we use the sjx rop

307
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
project here and we will start a smash

308
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,120
small session to inspect all stack

309
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,320
frames

310
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
the inspection work runs the anchor

311
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,839
street it does not affect the stack data

312
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
in attack screen

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
so with the time to stack memory we can

314
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,959
find out the chance of the guardian code

315
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,000
as the thing shows

316
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,959
also this may have some limitation due

317
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,880
to the performance limitation it does

318
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,360
not recommend the smell for not just

319
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
girl introspection

320
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,079
or continuous and level monetary

321
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
there are also some improvement method

322
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
like a break a large task into several

323
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,560
smaller sub-tasks or block other streams

324
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,600
from the

325
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
exclusion by hooking their camera

326
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
unclear enter to reduce their

327
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,760
host hunting time

328
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,839
so we have a concluded project

329
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
asmr is the lower system for sds and

330
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
cloud lab memory introspection with and

331
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,320
level of digital data generates and the

332
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,199
security preserving assurance

333
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
also they can find the integration

334
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
protocol that harmless the

335
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,959
power of the x86 smm and the

336
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,760
gravitographic to securing broad

337
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,199
strapped thrust on an enclave

338
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
the overhead of smell-based

339
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
introspection comprise a fixed overhead

340
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,440
of 281

341
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,560
microseconds and the yin and level

342
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,199
question overhead glowing nearly with

343
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,760
the workload

344
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
we can claim this is the first tour that

345
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,199
enables empowers and unclear owners to

346
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,839
connect on demand run-time data from the

347
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
enclave under software exploitation

348
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
attack

349
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
that's all the presentation and thank

350
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,040
you listen it

351
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
okay i think we should give the authors

352
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,040
a chance to answer a question

353
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
questions yes we have a question

354
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,160
so thank you for the presentation my

355
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,639
question is do you just modify the

356
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,480
include binary to incorporate the worker

357
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,399
for interest introspection

358
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
lee can you hear the question

359
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,480
uh he's muted i think

360
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
sorry yeah we couldn't hear you like can

361
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,720
you speak now oh okay can you hear me

362
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,519
yes

363
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,959
yes uh

364
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,440
sorry can you repeat the question again

365
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,240
uh my question is like that do you

366
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
modify the enclave binary to incorporate

367
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,000
the introspection functionalities

368
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,399
[Music]

369
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,199
no we don't modify the

370
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,399
binary of the layer we just added the

371
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,120
work page and design page into the lab

372
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,240
once we compare once we're comparing the

373
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
image

374
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
so you you by computer you're pressing

375
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,279
compile the image

376
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,360
is just like creating the enclave binary

377
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,279
yeah yeah but we know that

378
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
yeah that's true we need to add

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
the functions into a loma angle

380
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,120
okay so

381
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,279
after the include battery is modified

382
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
the measurement is going to be changed

383
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,020
right

384
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,319
[Music]

385
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,399
the moment

386
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,839
yeah i mean the measurement of the

387
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,319
enclave

388
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,720
uh

389
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,079
yes

390
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,880
so

391
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,679
then how can the user

392
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,880
do a testation to the enclave

393
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
uh we need to add the function for the

394
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,839
the introspection function as a part of

395
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,000
the longer and left so

396
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
once we measure the length we need to

397
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,840
measure the hole uh including the

398
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,640
angus rhythm on the wall stream into the

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,280
lab together

400
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,840
okay okay thank you

401
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,919
okay we're actually out of time so i

402
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,600
think we should take further questions

403
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,559
on on the hop-in online thing there were

404
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,240
actually a lot of good questions and

405
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
answers going on there so

406
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,870
we can take it there thank you everybody

407
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,820
[Applause]
