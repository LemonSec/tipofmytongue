1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,439
thank you tom uh hello everyone i'm

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,960
nisham bhaskar from university of

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,359
california san diego and today i'll be

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,679
presenting our work on evaluating the

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,519
feasibility of physical layer ble

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
location tracking attacks on mobile

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,040
devices

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,400
this paper is co-authored by

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
hadigevechan and me

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
unfortunately he could not be here today

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
so uh but he'll feature in the slides

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
all right so

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,960
all our smart devices currently are

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
constantly sending out bluetooth beacons

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
and these beacons enable a whole host of

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,680
features for example locating your lost

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,480
devices or you know even in recent times

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,640
covered 19 contact tracing

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
the number of beakers being sent out is

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,920
quite a lot that's the hundreds of

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
beacons being sent out per minute

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,920
unfortunately this introduces a bit of a

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
privacy risk because the uh and we

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
envision a situation in which an

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,480
attacker can actually

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
uh basically start capture these beacons

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,760
using some device and then use those

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
beacons to develop a fingerprint

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,199
and then following that they can

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,280
actually put that device at some other

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
location say your home

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,360
and then use that to constantly track as

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,439
you go in and out of your home so this

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,040
sort of a privacy risk is definitely

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
there with the ble beacons

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,159
now

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
to prevent against this sort of privacy

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
risk at the mac layer there there are

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,799
provisions in place so for instance

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
there was always a concern that the mac

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
address is a constant persistent

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
identifier and so bluetooth introduced

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
the concept of rotating mac addresses

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,320
however this protections actually do not

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
actually solve the complete problem

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,439
because there is an underlying thread

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,240
that still exists at the physical layer

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,079
particularly what can happen is an

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
attacker can capture the actual wireless

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,960
signal raw signals using an sdr and then

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
you can measure the distortions due to

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,439
the hardware imperfections and use those

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
as a fingerprint to track you

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
so what are these hardware imperfections

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
that i speak of right and so the

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,759
hardware imperfections are essentially

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,840
due to the manufacturing variations that

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
occur in the radio hardware and here is

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
a

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
diagram of a actual front-end radio of

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,639
bluetooth radio and the

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,919
hardware imperfections that we are

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,920
particularly interested in are shown

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
here so for example cfo is the carrier

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,720
frequency offset that is due to the uh

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,879
pbm error of the oscillator crystal you

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,319
have iq offset that is due to the

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
carrier leakage onto the output

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
and iq imbalance due to the

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
manufacturing variation in the inq

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,040
chains

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
now what can happen is that if the

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,480
attacker can measure these imperfections

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
with great precision they can use that

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,720
as a fingerprint to track you

76
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,319
now there's been some work that has been

77
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,519
done in

78
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
bluetooth to be able to uh analyze these

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
uh imperfections but they have generally

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
have led to a very coarse estimate so

81
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
existing techniques have not been

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
sufficient

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
but at the same time there's been a lot

84
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
of work that has been done in other rf

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
technologies like wi-fi and in fact if

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
you look here that this radio is

87
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
representative of a most common smart

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
device wherein there is not a separate

89
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
wi-fi or bluetooth radio there's one

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
common one and there have been

91
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
techniques that have been developed to

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
sort of measure these properties for

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,280
wi-fi radios

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,959
and so the question then comes up is

95
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
that well you know why can't we just use

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,319
those same techniques for doing with

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,280
bluetooth

98
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,959
radios as well

99
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
well so the the tricky thing about

100
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
bluetooth bluetooth

101
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
packets in general is the fact that they

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
have a very short known sequence what do

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
i mean by that is that the fundamental

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,159
premise of measuring these hardware

105
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
imperfections requires us to have a bit

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,319
of a known sequence or known set of bits

107
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,319
as a reference against which i measure

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
the receive signal to sort of

109
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
measure the distortions

110
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
and in wi-fi primarily because of ofdm

111
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,200
decoding you actually need to have this

112
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
sequence in place to be able to correct

113
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,599
for that before even correctly decoding

114
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,799
and that's why you have this long

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,560
sequence that allows you to sort of

116
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,040
perform these measurements uh easily

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
unfortunately in ble well

118
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,519
you don't actually need to have a such a

119
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
long known sequence because even a

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
course estimate of something like a cfo

121
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,599
is sufficient to perform ble decoding

122
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,360
right and so the ble known sequence is

123
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
very few symbols in length this actually

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,560
makes it very hard for us to use those

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,239
symbols itself to do

126
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,400
an estimation of these parameters

127
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,360
however so what we need as an attacker

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,959
if uh what i would need is essentially

129
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
to be able to use the entire payload or

130
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
the entire packet as opposed to just

131
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
those eight symbols and so well there is

132
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
an insight here which is the fact that

133
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
well we can utilize the entire packet of

134
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
as a known sequence this is because as i

135
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,919
said previously that decoding does not

136
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,840
actually depend on a good estimate of

137
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
the cfo or something so you can actually

138
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
perform the decoding actually get the if

139
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,280
you have received the packet correctly

140
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
you'll get all the bits and that gives

141
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,479
you a complete reference signal which is

142
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,800
as long as the entire packet itself

143
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,720
now you can use that to actually do uh

144
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
more higher precision estimates

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
so

146
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,199
the

147
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,360
using the entire packet what we do is

148
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
like we actually created a mechanism to

149
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
estimate the imperfections which is

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
based on a sort of like an optimization

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
approach we model the entire system and

152
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,759
like in an optimize and solve it as an

153
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,759
optimization approach which is basically

154
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
that we model the system with all its

155
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
imperfections we start with the clean

156
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,120
signal which is derived from the full

157
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
packet and then we iteratively introduce

158
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
imperfections into it and to basically

159
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
make it close to the received signal

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
and with this we were able to actually

161
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
achieve very uh high precision

162
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
imperfection estimates

163
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
so and so this plot on the right

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
actually shows uh the the yellow line

165
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,039
actually is representative of uh the

166
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,479
estimate done with only the eight bits

167
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,479
of the preamble versus the estimates as

168
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,240
we returned from our technique and we

169
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
see that the standard deviation in

170
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
measuring cfo is significantly reduced

171
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,160
and plus because we use all samples of

172
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
the signal there's an additional

173
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
advantage that we reduce the impact of

174
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
noise by sort of averaging across all

175
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,199
the samples as well so snr impact is

176
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,880
reduced

177
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,479
and so it is

178
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,160
clearly it is a bit feasible to actually

179
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
get the fine grained fingerprint from

180
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
this uh estimation technique

181
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
now the big question then comes up is

182
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
that okay right you can estimate the

183
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
parameters great but then you know i

184
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,680
take out these sdrs and try to do this

185
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
physical tracking in the real world in

186
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,479
the real world

187
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
all sorts of things happen right if

188
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,759
the wireless environment can change i

189
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,199
can go to a coffee shop i can go to a

190
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
library i can be in the hallway

191
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,199
and physical environment physical

192
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
parameters can also change say the

193
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
temperature changes how does this

194
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,360
actually impact is it even feasible uh

195
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
to do this tracking what are the

196
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
challenges an attacker will face

197
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
so we try to evaluate some of the

198
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
challenges the first one we came across

199
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
was that well in the real world when you

200
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
observe a lot of devices a lot of

201
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
devices actually have very close

202
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
fingerprints

203
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
and so what would happen is that

204
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
there is a more likely chance in the

205
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
real world of confusing them as opposed

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
to some devices which have less close

207
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
fingerprints another thing that we

208
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
observed is that these fingerprints or

209
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
these estimated parameters are

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
sort of dependent on the chipset so in

211
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,280
particular and so some chipsets have uh

212
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,400
across different uh types of radios have

213
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,280
a wide variation in these parameters but

214
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,639
like in particular there was this one

215
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
type of chipset where we saw that they

216
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
were they had absolutely no iq offset

217
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,160
and this was actually the ble only

218
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,479
radios uh seem to have no iq offset

219
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
because they have a completely different

220
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,680
radio architecture and this makes it

221
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,199
particularly harder to sort of

222
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
fingerprint them

223
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,360
now

224
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
the second problem that an attacker may

225
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,039
run into is that well you know for one

226
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
sec frequency offset or frequency offset

227
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
depends on the crystal and that drifts

228
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
with temperature and so what can happen

229
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,919
is that as the phone activity sort of

230
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
increases as we can see on the plot on

231
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,199
the left there's a game that is being

232
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,840
played the frequency offset may change

233
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
and and so would it also change when the

234
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,759
ambient temperature changes so for

235
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
example you put the phone in your pocket

236
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
and you take it out and if there's a hot

237
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,280
day or something it can also be varied

238
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
and so this is also a challenge that an

239
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
attacker would probably face given

240
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,960
however in a lot of the conditions that

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
we saw where we were performing this

242
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
attack we saw that for the most part uh

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
in the common case there would be a

244
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,919
situation where in like the phone is in

245
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
your pocket or the phone is in your hand

246
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
right

247
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
um there are additional logistical

248
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
challenges and i call them logistical

249
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
because it's more like how does the

250
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
attacker like you know place the sdr so

251
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
for instance the as

252
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
we realize that some smartphones have a

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
much higher transmit power than other

254
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,000
smartphones and so

255
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
in that case what would happen is the

256
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
range is different so you have to decide

257
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
where to place your sdr

258
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,039
now the other thing that may happen is

259
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,199
that the low cost sdrs

260
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
if you if i want to use a low cost sdr

261
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
instead of a 2000 usrp that may actually

262
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,120
have some imperfections of its own

263
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
reflect my measurement as well and also

264
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,360
the the target may be actually moving it

265
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
may not actually be stable so then there

266
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
could be things like doppler effect the

267
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
last two

268
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
did not seem to have that much of an

269
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,919
impact and we talked about this a little

270
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,599
bit more in the paper as well

271
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
um and the first one also i mean uh the

272
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
first one is is more tricky but like

273
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
yeah i mean uh it's hard to sort of

274
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
envision how to place the sdr that way

275
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,640
but then at the end of with all these

276
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
challenges in mind the big question then

277
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,200
comes up is okay do you have all these

278
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
challenges we have a good way of

279
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,040
estimating the parameters how successful

280
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
can an attacker be in the real world all

281
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,680
right so to be able to be to get into

282
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
before i get into that i want to

283
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
basically lay out what the tracking

284
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
algorithm essentially does like so we

285
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,640
did the estimates of the hardware

286
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
imperfections then in the fingerprinting

287
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,959
stage we repeat this for like 50 packets

288
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
per device and get a sort of a

289
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,000
distribution and then we take this

290
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
distribution and for any let's say we

291
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
want to perform tracking any packet that

292
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
comes from an unknown device we sort of

293
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,320
try to see the statistical distance with

294
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
respect to this distribution and if it's

295
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
within a certain threshold we call it as

296
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
that coming from that device um these 50

297
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
and 10 packets they're not magic numbers

298
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
uh we have detailed experiment in the

299
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
paper which actually tells how we got to

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
these numbers they seem to give us the

301
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
best sort of uh give us a high there's a

302
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,040
lowest number of packets for which you

303
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
get a decent enough accuracy of tracking

304
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,959
and so

305
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,560
i give presented now we did a whole

306
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
bunch of field experiments and there's a

307
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
bit of an overview here which is what we

308
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
did was we took our sdr and went out

309
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,839
into the field and collected ble beacon

310
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
data from uncontrolled mobile devices we

311
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
had no control over these devices i went

312
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
to coffee shops library food courts

313
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
there was this huge facility where

314
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
people were walking through and in an

315
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
analysis we essentially answered three

316
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
questions like how accurately can we

317
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,240
actually track certain targets

318
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,079
is is it is the smart device actually

319
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
distinguishable when there are hundreds

320
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
and hundreds of devices and how feasible

321
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
is an actual tracking of a person

322
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,079
so to evaluate the first thing which is

323
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
the accuracy of tracking what we did was

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
we took a few smart devices did a

325
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,360
fingerprinting of them in an office

326
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
environment on say day zero then took

327
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,880
these smart devices and the sdr to a

328
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,279
food court and we basically put the sdr

329
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
there and captured all ble beacons from

330
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
50 other devices around and the goal was

331
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
simply that can the

332
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
sdr actually spot can our tracking

333
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,279
algorithm actually spot the devices that

334
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
gave us a sense of false negatives for

335
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,959
doing the false positives what we did

336
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
was we we took the sdr to the coffee

337
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
shop did not take the targets this

338
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,640
coffee shop was 10 miles away just i

339
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
that doesn't matter but yeah and we

340
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
collected a whole bunch of data from 50

341
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
60 different devices and we tried to

342
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
analyze that if any of our targets you

343
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
know incorrectly showed up and what we

344
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,440
observed was that for across 17 distinct

345
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
target devices including smartphones

346
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
swatches laptops we observed that the

347
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
average uh false positive and false

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
negative ratio was significantly low

349
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
almost at like three percent and most

350
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
devices have

351
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,519
sort of

352
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
have very low fpr and fnr indicating

353
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
they have somewhat distinguishable

354
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
imperfection of course there were some

355
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,160
devices with a bit of outliers right and

356
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,200
now so

357
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
keeping this in mind we are clearly it

358
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
appears that a lot of devices are very

359
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
uh trackable but then okay you might say

360
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
that this is only 50 devices right what

361
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,959
happens if there's like 200 devices or

362
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,920
300 devices around these do these

363
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,440
distinguishing

364
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,680
are these as distinguishable then to

365
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,839
evaluate that what we did was uh we took

366
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,639
our str and we put it at uh the sort of

367
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
exit of a hor exit of a room through

368
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
which a number of people would pass

369
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,839
during the day it was almost like a

370
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
moving queue and so they would pass by

371
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
the sdr for around couple of minutes and

372
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,320
so we would see a lot of unique devices

373
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
per day so we did this for like two days

374
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,279
10 hours a day and uh we captured around

375
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,000
beacons from 647 devices and all of

376
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
these devices were predominantly

377
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
smartphones because we specifically look

378
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
for contact racing beacons and so what

379
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
we did was then for each of these

380
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
devices we sort of calculated the

381
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,480
average uh cfo and iq offset across all

382
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
the packets that we received from the

383
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,839
device and we plotted a two-dimensional

384
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,720
histogram here of uh the cfo iq offset

385
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
of all these devices the number of bins

386
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
that have been chosen in this histogram

387
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,680
is such that

388
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
the size of the like i mean the number

389
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
of bits is significantly larger than the

390
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
total number of devices and the size of

391
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
the bin is like

392
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,040
almost double the typical expected

393
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
standard deviation for say cfo

394
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,839
and so basically what we are saying is

395
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,480
that if say the the color is blue which

396
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,000
means that there is no overlap that

397
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,120
means the device is perhaps

398
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,279
distinguishable even in the c of 600

399
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,760
devices and we saw that even in this

400
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,720
random collection of 650 devices almost

401
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,079
we 47.1 devices were com had very

402
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,360
distinct fingerprints and did not

403
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,519
overlap with anything and we saw another

404
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,760
15 devices that only had one overlap

405
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
with some other thing which basically

406
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,360
means to say that even in out in the

407
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,680
wild in the real world situation there's

408
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
a lot of devices out there that have

409
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,720
very distinguishable fingerprints which

410
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,600
sort of

411
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,399
makes this tracking a real threat in

412
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,600
some sense

413
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,279
and finally like what would happen if i

414
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,800
actually perform this sort of uh

415
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,399
tracking of a person right so we go back

416
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,880
to that original video that we had and

417
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,360
what happens in that situation so uh

418
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
imagine a person well imagine the

419
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
attacker actually fingerprinting

420
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
the victim's device at a particular

421
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
location like an office and then they

422
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,519
put their str

423
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,120
at the at the home of this person

424
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
wherein they go in and out and so what

425
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,120
we try to see if we can actually keep

426
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,199
track of as the

427
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
as the smart device is going in and out

428
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
of the home and what we observed that

429
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
during the duration of about one hour we

430
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
were constantly running tracking

431
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
instances every 10 seconds to see every

432
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,480
10 seconds if the person went in or out

433
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
if we detected it or not and using that

434
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
we were able to get with pretty high

435
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,320
accuracy detect when the person was

436
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
going in and out of their homes even in

437
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
the presence of almost 30 to 40 devices

438
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
always around

439
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,959
so this actually makes it seem that this

440
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,720
actually shows that tracking is actually

441
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,639
feasible in very much real world

442
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
situations and even in the presence of

443
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
uh sort of other devices around

444
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,880
now finally there are some certain

445
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
possible defenses that to this tracking

446
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
right to this vulnerability and which is

447
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
basically that

448
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,079
you can uh what can happen is to be able

449
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,839
to solve this problem one can do is like

450
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,199
they can add hardware or firmware

451
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,040
modifications to add sort of a time

452
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
varying cf4 iq offset that could perhaps

453
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
confuse the attacker when they try to

454
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
fingerprint them or track them

455
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
and then there is this other idea which

456
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
is which is less okay it's you can

457
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
actually have a software that runs a

458
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
time varying computation that causes

459
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,600
temperature changes but well that will

460
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
really kill your battery um the first

461
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
idea is seems more reasonable but yeah

462
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
it requires some implementation as

463
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
future work so to conclude basically for

464
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
many smart devices we've seen that

465
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
physical ability tracking is definitely

466
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,040
a real threat in in this in the world

467
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
and a number of real-world devices have

468
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
very distinguishable imperfections and

469
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
therefore are vulnerable to this sort of

470
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,720
an attack and i

471
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
like to thank you from both the victim

472
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
and the attacker

473
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,959
thank you very much

474
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,639
thank you very much uh we have time

475
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,320
plenty of time for questions but please

476
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,079
head to the mic so people online can

477
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,680
hear

478
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
hi this is daniel antonio from eureka

479
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,120
thanks

480
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
this is great work

481
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
i was wondering if your tracking

482
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,279
algorithm

483
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
depends also on the frequency hopping

484
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
scheme that is used by ble are you

485
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,560
taking into account the fact that the

486
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,680
frequency

487
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
changes

488
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
or not

489
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,320
so uh

490
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
basically what we are looking at is

491
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,320
purely a beacon packet so there are uh

492
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,199
this is uh in the advertisement stage so

493
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
this is like uh yeah we have three

494
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,240
advertisements we have three

495
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
advertisement channels are you focusing

496
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,880
on a single channel or you are so

497
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
no our algorithm is independent of the

498
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,360
channel we definitely do uh

499
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
keep track of which channel it is so of

500
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
course we have to

501
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,600
um

502
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
keep track of that but yeah the

503
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
algorithm itself does not uh necessarily

504
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,600
depend on the channel okay and uh

505
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
regarding the use case

506
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,079
and you i think you tracked beacons

507
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,560
from contact racing apps but if you

508
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,399
change the use case let's say that there

509
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,759
is a different type of advertisement

510
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,759
with different type of advertising

511
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,759
scheme and data do you think that you

512
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,440
can reuse the same algorithm or you have

513
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
to adapt the algorithm

514
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,279
to track someone

515
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,399
um

516
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,800
i don't fully get by data you mean okay

517
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,440
uh so weed actually did not only limit

518
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,880
ourselves to contact tracing contact

519
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,039
racing was the more recent experiments

520
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
we did after the pandemic we actually

521
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,959
started the speed pandemic and so their

522
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,199
initial 17 target experiment a lot of it

523
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,559
was actually using the apple continuity

524
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,079
framework so you know those beacons that

525
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,559
you used to hand off so um the the

526
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
actual packet content of the beacons is

527
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,919
immaterial i mean it does not uh matter

528
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,199
so much to us

529
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,120
um the only thing that we use from the

530
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
packet content really is the mac address

531
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,000
and we only use that as a label so for

532
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
instance i want to get 50 packets from a

533
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,480
device at any instant of time i know

534
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
that you know even if it's a random

535
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,679
address if it's there's 50 packets from

536
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
one device that label that is one device

537
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
so that's really the only information i

538
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,520
use okay thanks

539
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,160
so i'm surya there from penn state and

540
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
before i asked my question

541
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
i admit that it could really sound

542
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
stupid but

543
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,600
there's probably something that i've

544
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
misunderstood but

545
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,559
when ble is advertising itself

546
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,880
essentially in the advertisement a

547
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
unique identifier is encoded

548
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
and you are doing this at the physical

549
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,039
level right

550
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,160
so

551
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
uh i'm

552
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
i kind of fail to see the challenge in

553
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
this because

554
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
uh it seems to me that

555
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
whatever

556
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,720
you know whatever you're sensing

557
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,559
physically would essentially be

558
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,960
analogous to the unique identifier

559
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
itself

560
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
okay yeah um

561
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
i

562
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,919
so

563
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
i'm not sure i got that

564
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
like

565
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,559
is your concern that like you uh that

566
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,080
the challenge part like what was

567
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,200
difficult about doing yes oh okay yeah

568
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,919
so

569
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,799
so

570
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
the actual sensing and estimation of

571
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
these parameters itself

572
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
you can estimate the parameters with

573
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,919
anything but the estimation of the

574
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,840
parameters depends essentially on the

575
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,200
number of samples you use in the

576
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,320
estimate

577
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
right so it's like it's like

578
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,080
you get a much

579
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
better estimate or a much tighter

580
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
distribution of the estimate if you have

581
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
many more samples

582
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,960
the problem with the traditional uh and

583
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,200
by samples i mean what you need to know

584
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
is you need to know some part of the

585
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
signal that is sort of known so let's

586
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
say there's a sequence zero one zero one

587
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,000
you know that as is and then uh versus

588
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
and you compare that against what you

589
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
actually get and that's how you sort of

590
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
uh estimate these parameters

591
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,120
um originally in bluetooth the big

592
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
problem was that the the only known

593
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
sequence in most most communication is

594
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,080
preamble

595
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,400
preamble is extremely short in bluetooth

596
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,559
and because of that short duration uh

597
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
the typical techniques that we use for

598
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,559
calculating these parameters like the

599
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,880
things that we could use in say wi-fi or

600
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
something

601
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,679
they do not actually give you great

602
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,200
estimates

603
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
and so the problem is like uh when you

604
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
have to do tracking and when i have to

605
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
do tracking in the sense that i want to

606
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
be able to distinguish hundreds of

607
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
thousands of devices

608
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,919
every little difference that i have

609
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,240
simply because of my measurement error

610
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
makes a huge difference as an attacker

611
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
because i will start confusing

612
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
everything of course it has like five or

613
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
ten devices it's perhaps less of a

614
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,559
concern

615
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,720
okay yeah that does answer my question

616
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
thank you

617
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,280
time for maybe one quick question okay

618
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,159
so i'm search from epfl

619
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
uh about contact racing the privacy

620
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,840
protection used to be quite

621
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
controversial so i was wondering if you

622
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
reported your results to apple and

623
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
google

624
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
so

625
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
so this is particularly uh

626
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
i think we have

627
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
we have actually

628
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,440
talked to them but we have informed them

629
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,520
what we're doing but the thing is that

630
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
we're not actually in particular

631
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
violating contact tracing privacy what

632
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,600
we are showing that beyond just contact

633
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,919
racing itself so contact racing is just

634
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,400
one of the applications that is

635
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
concerned here actually our phones are

636
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,520
sending out

637
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
at this point the number of beakers

638
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
they're sending out is even beyond

639
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
contact testing there's a huge number so

640
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,799
it's mostly about like ble devices

641
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,240
sending out these beacons so contact

642
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
racing yes is one application where

643
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,200
there's a concern

644
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
more importantly to our point is that

645
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:20,340
we

646
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,480
[Music]

647
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
in in terms of like the ethics of the

648
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
thing we actually have no identifiable

649
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
information at best we can

650
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
identify a particular device

651
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
i have actually unless somebody tries

652
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
specifically to identify the

653
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
the person i have no identify the

654
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,840
information about the person themselves

655
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
um so

656
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,120
so yeah i mean i do not have a good

657
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,600
answer to that question but i think we

658
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,559
have

659
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
definitely

660
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
been we have talked to them about this

661
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,480
but yeah i mean it's it's mostly in the

662
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,679
sense that there is no direct

663
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
identification of any individual and to

664
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
that end i would agree with the contact

665
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,559
tracing the privacy preserving mechanism

666
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,000
does ensure that we cannot actually

667
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
track any specific individual easily

668
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,360
even this attack would require a very

669
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,559
a bit of a skilled uh person

670
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,679
and even

671
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,280
this this attack was valid even

672
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
pre-contact tracing this was nothing to

673
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
specifically do with contact racing
