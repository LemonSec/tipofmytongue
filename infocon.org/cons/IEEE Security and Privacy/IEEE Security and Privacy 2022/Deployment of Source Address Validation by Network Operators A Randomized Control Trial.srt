1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,240
thank you

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,400
hello everyone today i'm going to talk

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,240
about our paper deployment of source

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
address validation by network operators

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
a randomized control trial this paper

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,799
was jointly done with alissa frick

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,519
matthew lucky marcia kochinski michelle

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,440
and my supervisor carlos ghanian

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
so let's begin with the main research

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
question of the study

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
let's say if you have found a

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,439
vulnerability or a misconfiguration in

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,720
the network

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
how would you approach network operators

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,558
what is the best method

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,719
for them for you to approach them and

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,520
what happens if you ask them nicely

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,160
or how about sending them notification

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
through a trusted

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,120
entity

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
finally do providers care if you

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
publicly name them

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
to answer this question

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,360
we

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
we performed the randomized control

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
experiment and made all of them as

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
treatments

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,399
so

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,559
to begin with we needed a security

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,160
challenge

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,600
in 2019 ripe ncc conducted a survey and

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,080
now asked network operators about the

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
most significant operational security

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,200
challenge

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,920
more than 4 000 operators participated

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
in the study and they mentioned

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,439
distributed denial of service attack as

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,680
one of the top security challenge for

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,439
them

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
so how does a distributed denial of

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
service attack work

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
it's commonly use a methodology which is

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,240
called ip spoofing in which the attacker

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,280
forges the ip address of the victim

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
and sends requests to systems that

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,759
access amplifiers these are dns

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,560
amplifiers like dns or memcache servers

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
these systems reply with the larger

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
response than the requests sent by the

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
attacker

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,280
thereby congesting

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
the victim's network

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
so then the question is how can

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
operators prevent ip spoofing

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,640
well there are two rfcs pcb 38 and bc

56
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,439
bcp84 they've been more than two decades

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,719
old

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,598
and the idea is a very straightforward

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
forward idea which is also known as

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
source address validation or sav

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,640
that the source ip address of every

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
packet leaving the network should be

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,360
checked

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
against a set of allowed addresses and

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
the packet with the invalid source ip

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
should be discarded

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,040
so from our example

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
if the attacker sends a packet outwards

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
the internet service provider should

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
check

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
the

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
outgoing package and if it's a forced ip

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
address it should have been discarded or

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
dropped

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
to to find out networks that do not

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,440
allow ipspoofing we

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
did an internet wide scans we found a

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
vulnerability in

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
open resolvers where if you send a query

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,200
to a resolver

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
for the misconfigured resolver they send

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
back a reply with the wrong ip address

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
we did a complete ipv4 scan

84
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,800
and found out

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
more than 2500 networks that lack source

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
address validation

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,840
we then performed a large scale

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
notification experiment

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
with control group that focused on

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
network operator as our primary

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
population

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
so to run the experiment we had various

93
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
treatment groups for instance we send

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,400
direct emails we notified operators

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,239
through national search or we use

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,080
network operator group mailing lists

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
which are also called noc lists

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
we also added nudges

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
to our messages to the operators

100
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
finally we had a control group which was

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
not notified

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,120
which also acted as the baseline for our

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
experiment

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
so let's break down the notification

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
channels first

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
direct emails were sent through a

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,519
university email account to the

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,519
operators that did not had source

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
address validation

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
we also prioritize the technical

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,360
contacts from peering db or whois

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
database

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
wherever we did not find the technical

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,560
contacts of the operators we send the

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,519
notifications to abuse email addresses

116
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
to the notifications to the cert we

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
created or crafted a message

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
to the search and requested them to send

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
the notifications to the providers in

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
their service region we also partnered

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,560
with nic.br which is a cert-like

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
authority in brazil and routinely sends

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
notification about vulnerabilities to

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
the operators

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,120
we requested nic.br to also help us with

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,199
the follow-up message if the request if

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,080
the operators ask for more help

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
uh implementing suv in their network

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
finally

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,639
we bundle our notification with spoofer

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,639
tool which already sends notification

132
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,520
about networks that lack sav to send on

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
network operator group list in various

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,479
regions

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
now let's talk about the nudges that we

136
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
had in our message so we had the

137
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
baseline message where we

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
requested network operators or encourage

139
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
them to implement sav

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
then we had a social nudge in the social

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,039
notch category we told the operators

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
that there are 75 percent of the network

143
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
operators that have already implemented

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
bcp-38 or source address validation and

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
they should also deploy

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
it finally we had a reciprocity nudge

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
wherein we added a message

148
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,320
in our notification we told the

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
operators that you are receiving

150
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
less number of fewer ddos attacks

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,320
because other networks have implemented

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
bcp-38 and you should deploy bcp-38 in

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,758
your network to return the favor

154
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
so let's talk about the final design

155
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
we had operators we randomly assigned a

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
to control group some operators

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
which we did not notify at all then we

158
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,000
divided our population into two groups

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
the ones in brazil and the ones outside

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
brazil that is the rest of the world we

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
did braz we

162
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
take brazil as a

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
separate case study because one we had

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,639
a cert-like authority there which sent

165
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,360
notification on our behalf and secondly

166
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
one third of the population was also in

167
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
brazil

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
so we sent the baseline we sent the

169
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
direct emails which had three different

170
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
nudges so operators in these three

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
categories were randomly assigned in

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,039
these groups then we had for the

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
cert we had only the baseline message

174
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
and we sent the message on the north

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
list for brazil

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
for the rest of the world we had

177
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,000
multiple other treatments for instance

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
we had the

179
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
baseline treatments for the direct

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
messages and then social and reciprocity

181
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
but in this category we also

182
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
had certs where we assigned them to one

183
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
of these nudges

184
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
so in that category if whatever

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
operators were assigned to these search

186
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,599
we sent the message with the nudge

187
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,240
already in those messages to and

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,759
requested the search to forward that

189
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
messages to the operators and then we

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,400
sent the message also to the no on those

191
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,199
service regions

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,400
uh we after we have randomly assigned

193
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,919
these groups we sent out the

194
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
notifications

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
and we had a bounce rate of only five

196
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
percent that is 95 in 95 percent of the

197
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,199
cases the messages were delivered so we

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,440
did not receive any email saying that

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,080
for any reason the message was bounced

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
back

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,960
and then we waited for two more months

202
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
before sending a reminder

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
to the operators that have not

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,199
remediated finally we waited another two

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
months before we started our analysis to

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
see if our experiments if our treatment

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
groups have any impact compared to

208
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,719
control group

209
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,440
for the analysis we did survival

210
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,080
probability or survival analysis

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,560
so again the analysis was done in

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
where brazil we

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
took it as a special case study

214
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,319
and we did not see any difference

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,160
between the control group and the

216
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
treatment groups

217
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
whether it was brazil or the rest of the

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
world

219
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,960
we thought maybe

220
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,639
we could see differences at the network

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,919
level so we analyzed at the asn level

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,560
and we analyzed also at the prefix level

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
the results were quite similar the

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
control group was not significantly

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
different than any of the treatment

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
groups

227
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
finally we looked at the factors that

228
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
might be affecting the remediation rates

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
we ran a cox mix effect model

230
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
and in this we found that

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
a few network properties

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,880
uh where we could see that they were

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
significantly affecting the remediation

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
rates for instance the asm size this is

235
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
basically the ip space advertised by the

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
asn so this so the asses that were

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,839
advertising small number of ip space

238
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,640
were

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,600
uh

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
remediated faster than the air sense

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
that had large ip space

242
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,200
similarly air sens which had fewer edge

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
routers also remediated

244
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,279
faster than the

245
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,000
air sense that had

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
more routers and in a sense that were

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
stop ascs that is that they are the

248
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
final as and they do not have any more

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
customary asses also remediated

250
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
better compared to the

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
rest of the asses

252
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
so in summary our experiment reveals a

253
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,399
painful and disappointing reality that

254
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
there was no evidence of any remediation

255
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,880
driven by any of the treatments compared

256
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
to the control group

257
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
even for the notification from the

258
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
brazilian cert where we know that the

259
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
search sent out the notifications

260
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,800
because for the rest of the ones um we

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
did not know we got replies from the

262
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,079
german cert where he they cc'd us but

263
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
the rest of the search we do not know if

264
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,360
they've forwarded our email

265
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
so then we designed a survey to ask

266
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
operators about

267
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,519
uh the

268
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,279
why our treatment group or to

269
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
investigate why our treatment groups did

270
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,399
not work

271
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
the we had four main objectives one we

272
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,160
wanted to know if the providers actually

273
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
know about this vulnerability

274
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
did we reach the

275
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
correct contact person

276
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
and if there are any challenges in

277
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
actually implementing source address

278
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,720
validation finally we wanted to solicit

279
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
suggestions on how to improve the

280
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
notification process in general

281
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,760
we sent out the survey one month after

282
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
our final notification we received

283
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,399
responses from 32 network operators

284
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,839
so in general uh 67 percent of the

285
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
operators said that they were actually

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
they are actually responsible for

287
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
implementing source address validation

288
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
13 were not sure and only 20 percent

289
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
said that they were not uh responsible

290
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
for implementing sab in their network

291
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,560
uh for the vulnerability awareness 90

292
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,360
knew

293
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
that their network did not had source

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,399
address validation

295
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
and 10 claimed that their network was

296
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,880
fully compliant

297
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
we then asked the operators if they have

298
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,279
implemented source address validation uh

299
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
53 percent of the operators said that

300
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
they have not implemented source address

301
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,200
validation 17 percent said that they

302
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
have partial

303
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,360
compliance and 26 percent said that they

304
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
are fully compliant and four percent

305
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,800
were not sure

306
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
uh we've then asked the reasons for

307
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
non-compliance

308
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,519
and we got a majority of the operators

309
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,519
responded that they did not have enough

310
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
time or knowledge to actually implement

311
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
source address validation 18 were

312
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
worried that this will cause downtime

313
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,800
for their customers 12 percent had other

314
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
technical issues and

315
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,439
six percent said suv is not important

316
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
so then we looked at the recommendations

317
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
uh what can we do from here on

318
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,160
first of all our survey response

319
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
indicate that most of the notification

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,279
read the correct

321
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,480
recipients

322
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,040
so we propose that regional internet

323
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,279
registries which maintain the who is

324
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,600
database should keep an up-to-date

325
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,160
technical teams contact points as well

326
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
for the resources we sent manners

327
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,279
guidelines that provide

328
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,680
configurations for well-known routers to

329
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,839
implement source address validation

330
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,440
while majority of the operators said

331
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
that the guidelines were enough some of

332
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
the operators said that

333
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,839
that the guidelines were in english and

334
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,560
they had hard time following

335
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
also some operators suggested that

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,880
routers which are not commonly used were

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,079
uh the

338
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,360
the guideline did not have

339
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
configurations for those

340
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
finally if you look at the holistic

341
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,279
overview of

342
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,920
source address validation or bcp-38 in

343
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,120
general there is an issue of incentives

344
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
the operators that implement source

345
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,360
address validation in their network

346
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
stops uh or b or stop the attackers from

347
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,040
using their network to launch a ddos

348
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
attack but they are still prone to a

349
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,120
distributed denial of service attack

350
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
that means if they implement it they put

351
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,480
in effort and time and the benefit goes

352
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
to the rest of the world in economic

353
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,079
terms this is also called tragedy of the

354
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,279
commons

355
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,399
so we look at how we can basically

356
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
change this incentive structure

357
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
one of the ways could be that these top

358
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
networks have a connectivity through

359
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,959
upstream providers these are usually

360
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,240
tier one or tier two providers if they

361
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
these providers use their exercise

362
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,519
if they exercise their position of power

363
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,760
and only peer with providers that are

364
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
compliant we might produce we might give

365
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
them incentive to implement sav in their

366
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,760
network uh with this i would like to

367
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,639
thank and open it questions

368
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,760
all right thank you let's thank the

369
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,079
speaker

370
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
we have some time for questions if

371
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,320
anyone wants to come to the mic and ask

372
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,399
questions uh

373
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
maybe i'll start with the first one uh i

374
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,519
was curious about the

375
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
incentives uh you know we have seen uh

376
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,079
cloud providers like cloudflare and

377
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
cloudfront having a lot of this power

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,720
where

379
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
it feels like if these networks are not

380
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,639
doing any validation and are causing

381
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
ddos on others won't their users see

382
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
like captchas everywhere because

383
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,519
cloudflare thinks the network is like

384
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,040
can these providers like cloudflare

385
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
cloudfront akamai

386
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
be the ones to sort of incentivize like

387
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,320
it feels like there is an incentive that

388
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
users will see captures everywhere

389
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,639
that's true so so in in a way that if

390
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,240
you look another routing security

391
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
protocol rpqi which is like these days

392
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,959
everywhere everybody is talking about

393
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,399
rpki and one of the ways that rpki uh

394
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
got so much incentives was like these

395
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,079
these big providers this tier one tier

396
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,800
two actually stopped or rejected uh

397
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
networks that were not uh

398
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
or past that were not uh rpki signed so

399
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,519
i i do indeed think that there is a is a

400
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,079
way forward but for this there needs to

401
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,360
be a community action um um also like

402
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
the the operators are worried about

403
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,399
about having misconfigurations bgp is is

404
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
difficult a lot of operators don't touch

405
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,120
it once it's working so to have this

406
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
working or or to implement these kind of

407
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
things we need some kind of a push for

408
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,759
them to go in this direction there is

409
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,199
also a lot of need for hardware

410
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
operators or router manufacturers

411
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
to provide

412
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,040
easy to use for instance configurations

413
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
for for network for network operators to

414
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,839
basically move in this direction

415
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,279
okay uh

416
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,079
thanks for that uh and then anyone else

417
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,920
uh i'll continue asking

418
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
uh and so

419
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
are you proceeding with this direction

420
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
and and sort of asking

421
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,800
like what are the next steps and future

422
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,720
work that sort of uh

423
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,480
you you're following up on this uh

424
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
direction

425
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,199
so um

426
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,639
uh

427
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,079
one of the ways i think we can move

428
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,480
forward or what i'm looking forward is

429
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,360
that there is also less awareness so

430
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,759
uh networks that are compliant or

431
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,880
non-compliant uh so so the problem with

432
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,160
information is symmetry people don't

433
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
know about it there is an excellent

434
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
product project which is spoofer but

435
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,959
this is volunteer based project and

436
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
and only people like volunteers who run

437
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
this tool in their network so so people

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
know about those but there are various

439
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,399
other methodologies to detect networks

440
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,600
and i'm

441
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
one of the ways i think or or what i

442
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
propose is for rars to also show the

443
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
status of network operators if they are

444
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,399
actually implementing so there is more

445
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
awareness and that might also create uh

446
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
some kind of incentives

447
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,440
okay uh

448
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
hi chris and ossio carnegie mellon did

449
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
you get any feedback about limitations

450
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
from the forwarding information basis of

451
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
current routers

452
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,559
um so we did not get much of the

453
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
information because the manner guide

454
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
manners guideline

455
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,359
guide had

456
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,439
configurations for all the major routers

457
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,039
but for instance one of the operators

458
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,199
came back to us and said that

459
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,679
it did not have micro tick routers

460
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,679
so so i think manners had juniper and

461
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,079
cisco which most of the providers use

462
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
but it did not have for microtech and

463
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
they asked the operator said yeah i did

464
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
not have a way forward to implement it i

465
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
i know some major network providers that

466
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,440
actually are more lenient because they

467
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
can't fit

468
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
the

469
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,160
they can't fit the narrow definitions of

470
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
all their networks in the forwarding

471
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
information base of their routers so

472
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,959
they have to be more permissive

473
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,640
fantastic all right well we have uh

474
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,799
people from cloudflare and in somewhere

475
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,679
in the conference so hopefully

476
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,679
they can start pressurizing but thanks

477
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,960
so much for your time thank you

478
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,819
[Applause]
