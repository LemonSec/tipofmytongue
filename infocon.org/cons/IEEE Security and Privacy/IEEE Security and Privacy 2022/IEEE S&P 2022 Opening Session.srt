virtual uh participation

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
so um we had

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
this is the first hybrid conference we

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
had ordered you know two mode conference

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,160
we've done so we've

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
learned a lot of stuff so

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,800
we appreciate your patience and support

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,399
there are a few things that may not be

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
as smooth as as you are used to either

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,280
in an in-person or in virtual so thank

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
you for being patient with us before i

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
um jump in just a quick thing for those

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
joining us remotely on hoppin

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
this snapshot is not exactly what you

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
see but the thing i wanted to point out

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
is

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,119
when you're attending a session on a

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,080
stage

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
if you have questions or if you want to

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
chat about the current session then you

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,520
go to this stage tab and type your

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
questions or chat with people in that

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
session

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
under that

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,280
tab

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
if you have event related questions or

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,320
find the other people in the event then

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
you go to the events tab so that's the

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,880
that's one thing i want to point to that

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,040
point out before i dive in for those

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
joining remotely

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,399
same thing for

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,840
chat as well

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
stage versus event so be mindful of that

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
what a year it has been

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
as i mentioned i'm incredibly

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
grateful and delighted that so many of

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
you showed up in person

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
this opening session is a bit crowded

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,119
because

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,079
we wanted to avoid the time it takes to

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
switch

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
kick us out and sub you know put the

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
barrier back on for the sessions it

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
takes 45 minutes and we have a very

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
tight schedule so after this session you

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
should be able to spread out a little

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,879
bit more

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,840
in the three three tracks okay so the

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
first dual mode conference as i

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
mentioned

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
so

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,959
thank you for your support and patience

67
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,840
146 papers this year in three tracks

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
it's a 27 increase from last year and

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,280
this is the first time we are doing

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
three tracks in person and

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,200
tom and thorsten will talk about this

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,080
later

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,360
748 unique participants we had about 644

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
in 2019 when we did this in person of

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
course our virtual conferences had a lot

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
more audiences

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,640
they're more accessible given you know

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,599

the donors without whom this conference

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
cannot be the way we do it

103

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,840

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
this year like we don't have breakfast

107

work towards fixing that

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
so this

110
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,399
is not possible

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,560

236
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000

using the hashtag sp22 or ieee sp

248
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
and a few announcements so as you see

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,279
seating in each room we've tried to

250
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,279
reduce the number of seats at the tables

251
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
to allow for distancing so seats in each

252
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
room might be a little tight so help

253
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
each other find seats

254
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
this room is a little bit more packed

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,760
than we expect just because we are doing

256
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,959
uh all um all 500 people in in in this

257
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,760
room

258
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,519
um

259
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
as always this is the third time and for

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
those of you who haven't been in this

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
space if you see outside we are right

262
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
next to the street san francisco and

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
it's an open space so please be mindful

264
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
of your belongings

265
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,200
people can access this space easily so

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
just wanted to give you um a warning

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
apparently people know that there are a

268
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
lot of conferences happening here so

269
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,920
apparently a

270
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,560
spot for professional thieves

271
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
we have reduced seating at lunch tables

272
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
this year to allow for a little bit more

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
distance

274
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
and there will also be a few tables with

275
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,600
even more reduced seating available if

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
if you prefer to do it that way okay

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
and with that

278
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,399
i have to confess to a little royal mess

279
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,920
up on my part

280
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
um you all have

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,200
this

282
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
what i thought was an awesome

283
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,519
program for the conference

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,720
but

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
there is a copy paste error

286
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
uh sessions eight and b

287
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,079
the paper listings is not accurate

288
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,120
so thankfully our website and hop in um

289

of papers my the apologies for the

292
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,399
authors in those sessions

293
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
i'm gonna see if i can find a workaround

294
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,120
but right now i have a plan but until i

295
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,800
can execute it i will keep it to myself

296
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,120
thank you and my apologies again for the

297
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,920
authors in in those two sessions

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,800
uh finally um code of conduct we have

299
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,079
instituted a code of conduct in 2018

300
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,000
it's available we want to make this

301
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
conference a welcoming place for

302
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
everyone um if please review the policy

303
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
and i hope all of you adhere to this

304
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,240
policy we

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
typically don't have um too many issues

306
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,240
but i i hope it continues that way but

307
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
if at all you you find something that

308
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
violates this code of contact there is a

309
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
number on our website that you can call

310
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,880
it'll allow you to reach me and there's

311
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
you can also report uh by email

312
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
and there are also folks

313
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
walking around with this

314
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,120
code steward badges you can find them

315
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
and report any incidents you

316
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
have noticed or experienced as well

317
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
finally

318
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,120
you've seen this

319
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,600
while you're speaking on stage it's okay

320
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
to not have your mask

321
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
since there is enough distance and while

322
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,839
eating

323
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,000
we have to take them off but at all

324
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,399
other times we request that you keep

325
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,639
your masks on

326
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,240
we understand

327
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
that many of us are vaccinated and

328
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,760
maybe this is

329
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
some of us might feel this is not a

330
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
requirement but

331
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
many of us have to travel back in

332
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,639
testing positive will put a damper on

333
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
your travel plan so that's why we have

334
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
this in place so please kindly keep them

335
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
on and help all of us get back safe and

336
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,040
healthy

337
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
with that i will introduce our

338
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,279
incredible program chairs thorsten and

339
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,399
thomas

340
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
to come on stage and talk about the

341
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,040
program this year

342
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,920
[Applause]

343
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
okay yeah a wall a warm welcome also

344
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,519
from my side so either here in person or

345
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,000
remote my name is dawson halls and

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,079
together with tom riston part i had the

347
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
great pleasure to organize this year's

348
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,519
program

349
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
but first of all i would

350
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,000
again like to thank rakesh and this team

351
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
because rakesh not only organized an

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
in-person conference but he also

353
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
organized an online conference so two

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,480
conferences and this was an incredible

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
amount of work and it's a great pleasure

356
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,920
to be here today

357
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
this is the 43rd edition of the

358
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,120
symposium and it's the first hybrid one

359
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,839
so you will see that everything is

360
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,079
probably a bit new to us so we will have

361
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,959
a mix of both in-person presentations

362
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
remote presentations which are

363
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,399
pre-recorded videos

364
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
so after two years of

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,399
just virtual events we are now getting

366
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,720
back here in person but you will still

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
feel that we are in the middle of a

368
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,279
pandemic

369
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,000
so we have about 40 papers that are

370
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
where the authors are not able to come

371
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,240
here either because they cannot leave

372
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
the country due to the pandemic or they

373
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
didn't get a visa or due to other issues

374
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
so we try our best to make this still

375
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,680
and a good experience for everyone and

376
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
so the next three days will be exciting

377
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,519
so enjoy the time meet people talk to

378
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,760
people in the hallway and it's good to

379
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,279
be back to in-person events

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
still given that we are in the pandemic

381
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
please wear the mask and be a bit

382
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,240
cautious we heard the reports from acm

383
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
kai where a lot of people got infected

384
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,959
so honestly i hope that we will not have

385
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,920
it here at ieee the symposium on

386
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,040
security privacy

387
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
on thursday we will have one day of

388
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,399
workshops rakesh already mentioned this

389
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,199
so there's vood langsag dls and several

390
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
others so

391
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,639
in case you stay here or probably you

392
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,160
can also register if you want to stay

393
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,480
longer so this is an interesting week

394
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
full of

395
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,759
papers on security and privacy

396
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
in the next about 50 minutes i want to

397
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
present an overview of how we came here

398
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
so basically what was the processed the

399
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
process used in order to assemble the

400
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,279
program

401
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
everything started back in january last

402
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,959
year when tom

403
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
or when it became clear that tom serves

404
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,680
together with me as the pc chair so the

405
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
first step was to assemble a program

406
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
committee

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,199
we assembled a pc with more than 170

408
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,639
members

409
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,759
this is about 170 members because some

410
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,519
people had to step down during the

411
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,880
process given that it's a huge

412
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
commitment for one year or they had to

413
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,240
pause in one cycle but we had about 170

414
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,759
members in each

415
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
of the review cycles helping us to

416
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,120
review all these papers

417
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
what we tried to do is to cover a wide

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
geographical distribution so we had

419
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,680
people from the us from europe asia

420
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
australia we had people from industry

421
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
from academia so we

422
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
tried to assemble a pc with a broad

423
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
expertise given that the symposium

424
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,240
receives quite a wide variety of papers

425
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,120
ranging from theoretical results over

426
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,279
implementations usability aspects and

427
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
many other topics so we had to make sure

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,399
that we have the right people on the pc

429
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
and i think this worked also in most

430
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,199
cases

431
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
a challenge was that the conference is

432
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
growing year over year so we had more

433
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,079
than 1 000 submissions this year and so

434
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,199
we had to scale the whole procedure and

435
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,880
what we introduced for the first time

436
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
was the concept of associate shares so

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,240
these were specific people that helped

438
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
us especially with scaling

439
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
so in the first phase for example they

440
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,280
proposed us pc members which we could

441
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,679
invite then they helped us to manage

442
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,240
reviews they supported the discussion

443
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
and the rebuttal phase and helped us

444
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,880
also to converge on decisions

445
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,799
so without these associate shares it

446
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
would have been impossible for tom and

447
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,880
me to actually manage

448
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
all of this so

449
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
i'm very glad that we found a few people

450
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,080
who served in this role

451
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
the pc members reviewed on average about

452
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,760
20 papers across three cycles so per

453
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
cycle about six to eight papers and

454
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
reviewing 20 papers is a major

455
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,919
commitment

456
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,240
so without the pc we also would not have

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,480
been possible to assemble the program

458
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
and on the website you find all these

459
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,360
names of these people and so they did

460
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,200
most of the work in order to actually

461
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
assemble the program we will enjoy in

462
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,480
the next three days

463
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
we always strive for positive and

464
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,799
constructive reviews so we always

465
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
encourage them to provide constructive

466
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
actionable feedback that the authors

467
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
could use

468
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,039
of course this is a bit subjective some

469
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,360
of the reviews you have received

470
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
might not have this feeling but

471
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
this is the typical process and we tried

472
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
our best and what we also try to do is

473
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
to have a positive communication and

474
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
online discussion i think this worked in

475
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
most cases and i'll come back to some of

476
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
the mechanisms we used on the next few

477
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,760
slides

478
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,320
given the current situation we didn't

479
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
organize a physical pc meeting and also

480
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
no virtual one but what we did is all

481
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,120
discussions took place in hot crap so we

482
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,080
only had online discussions in order to

483
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,160
decide on which papers to accept or

484
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
reject

485
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
i think overall we had a good experience

486
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,000
maybe the process can also be improved

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,559
in the future but that's something tom

488
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,320
and patrick can figure out in the next

489
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,559
years

490
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
for the review process what we did is we

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
reduced the number of deadlines from

492
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
four to three

493
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
this was based on a discussion we had

494
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,440
last year in the community and also the

495
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
experience from last year where the

496
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
number of submissions in the first

497
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
deadline was rather low so therefore we

498
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,480
decided to skip this and stick to three

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
submission deadlines

500
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
and in each of these

501
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,160
review cycles we had two rounds of

502
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
reviews

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
in the first round we assigned two pc

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,720
members for each paper and if both

505
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
reviews were clearly negative so if

506
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,960
there was clearly no chance that the

507
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,440
paper would end up in the program then

508
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,240
we decided to early reject this paper

509
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,000
and these early reject notifications

510
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,919
were sent out after about one and a half

511
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,760
months

512
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
in the second preview phase we assigned

513
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
two in certain cases also three

514
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
additional pc members especially for

515
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,559
controversial papers in order to make

516
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,200
sure to get additional opinions so for

517
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
each paper we had at least four pc

518
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,639
members who reviewed this

519
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
what we then also introduced is an

520
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
interactive rebuttal phase where the

521
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,720
basic idea is that we released the

522
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,200
reviews after the second round and then

523
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,919
we had about one one and a half weeks in

524
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
order to exchange messages between the

525
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,159
authors and the reviewers

526
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,400
so the basic idea is that the authors

527
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
receive the reviews they can comment and

528
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
answer questions but the reviewers could

529
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,640
also

530
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
react to these responses

531
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,520
so honestly i think a closer interaction

532
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,919
between authors and reviews really helps

533
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,080
so i think we had overall a pretty good

534
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
experience

535
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,280
many cases where there was a lively

536
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,080
discussion between authors and reviewers

537
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
but on the other hand we also had cases

538
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
where

539
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,799
either reviewers were not really

540
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,919
responsive or authors only submitted

541
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,760
their rebuttal on the last day of the

542
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,320
rebuttal phase so in many cases this

543
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
also did not work but i think we learned

544
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
a few lessons and if you have ideas how

545
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
this whole process can be improved

546
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
please let us know because i think this

547
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,720
is also one of the challenges to solve

548
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
for the future how can we have a more

549
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,280
constructive discussion between authors

550
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,679
and reviewers to improve the review

551
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
process

552
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,799
notifications were sent out after about

553
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,360
two and a half months and we had

554
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,559
three cases of ultimate decisions

555
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,159
and this is also something where we did

556
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,799
the change in the review form because we

557
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,960
did not use the let's say traditional

558
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
form of accept weak accept reject reject

559
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
and strong reject or variance of this

560
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
but we only had three decisions that the

561
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,799
reviewers could take

562
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,720
so either they could recommend to accept

563
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
the paper

564
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
they could accept

565
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,840
recommend a major revision or reject so

566
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,200
only three choices because we think that

567
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,679
reviewers should stick with what they

568
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,960
should

569
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,440
see as the ultimate outcome of this

570
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
and this generated also quite a few

571
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
lively discussions and

572
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
i think what we learned is that it makes

573
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
sense to also have a separate category

574
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,080
so shepherding and this is something

575
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,480
that is also reflected in next year's

576
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,360
call for papers

577
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
major visions were handled similar to

578
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
last year's so

579
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
the reviewers

580
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
came up with a list of revision

581
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,600
expectations

582
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,520
these were communicated via hot crap and

583
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,000
the authors of these papers had two

584
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,919
cycles in order to address their

585
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,559
revision expectations submit the paper

586
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,120
again and we also used hot crab as an

587
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,200
anonymous communication channel so in

588
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
case authors had questions they could

589
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,919
send these questions directly to the

590
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,840
reviewers and this also helped to

591
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,039
clarify some of these expectations

592
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,919
what we try to do is we try to assign

593
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,320
the same pc members such that they can

594
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,240
check whether the revision expectations

595
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,600
have been met

596
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,159
this worked in many cases in some cases

597
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,640
reviews disappeared but overall we were

598
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,120
pretty happy with how everything worked

599
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
out

600
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
this then led to the following

601
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,080
submission statistics so what you can

602
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
see on the slide is for each of the

603
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
three cycles in blue the number of

604
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
submitted papers so we see a bit of

605
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
growth over time

606
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,520
in red you see the accepted papers you

607
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,400
see we are quite selective so the

608
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
attributes and posium on security

609
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
privacy is a rather selective conference

610
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,360
that's something that we also see here

611
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
directly in the numbers and in green you

612
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,919
see all the papers that received a major

613
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,520
vision decision

614
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
so you see actually quite a few of the

615
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
papers also received a major revision

616
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,360
and across all three cycles we received

617
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
a bit more than one thousand so 1012

618
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
papers

619
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
from submissions to program is actually

620
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
quite a complicated process that i want

621
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,200
to explain as part of this figure

622
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,840
so overall across all three cycles we

623
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,080
had 1012 submissions

624
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,760
of which 55 were directly accepted

625
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
so this means these papers

626
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,880
directly made it into the program and

627
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,760
the reviewers recommended to accept it

628
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,000
potentially with a with an assigned

629
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
shepherd

630
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,960
overall across all three cycles we also

631
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,080
had three submissions of 104 papers so

632
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
these were papers that were either from

633
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
last year's symposium where they

634
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,880
received a major revision decision or

635
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
they received a major revision decision

636
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,000
this year and the authors also opted to

637
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,960
resubmit to one of our three deadlines

638
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
so for example a paper that was

639
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,200
submitted to the first deadline received

640
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,279
a major revision could have been

641
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,039
resubmitted to the second or third

642
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,000
deadline and this is the pool of 104

643
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
major revisions

644
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
out of this pool 92 papers were accepted

645
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
and also

646
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,960
and 12 were rejected so you see the

647
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,799
acceptance rate for major revisions is

648
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,000
about 88 so the vast majority of these

649
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,320
papers actually eventually make it into

650
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,879
the program

651
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,840
overall we have this 55 direct accepts

652
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,960
plus the 92 accepted revised papers

653
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,039
which is a total of 147 papers which

654
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,360
leads to an acceptance rate of 14.5

655
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,000
percent for this year's

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
program which is slightly higher

657
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
compared to the last years where we had

658
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
about 12

659
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
on average

660
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,679
overall 144 papers received a major

661
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,679
revision decision so this includes

662
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,679
so therefore these two errors are not

663
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,200
really mutually exclusive but 144 papers

664
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,679
across all three cycles received a major

665
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,679
revision decision and the remaining

666
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,200
papers were rejected

667
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,520
taking a look back to the quarterly

668
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
submissions in the past years we see

669
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,039
that we see a

670
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,400
rather steady

671
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
growth year to year

672
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,400
typically we see more submissions in the

673
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,240
fall and winter deadlines i think this

674
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,360
is more

675
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,919
related to the traditional deadlines we

676
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
used to have earlier and also the fact

677
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,520
that the conference is in may

678
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,720
taking a

679
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,679
even further look back so historically

680
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,720
back until 2010 we see that the

681
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,279
community is growing so compared to last

682
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
year we have about six percent more

683
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,200
submissions for the first time more than

684
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
1 000 submissions

685
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
acceptance rate is a bit higher compared

686
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
to last year's but still rather

687
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
selective

688
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,120
and

689
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,799
maybe this is also something we as a

690
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,440
community can somehow address

691
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,600
that the number of accepted papers is

692
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,399
rather lowish

693
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,799
what we introduced this year is a

694
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,360
so-called research ethics committee

695
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
so if you attended last year's

696
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,360
conference you probably remember the

697
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,520
other discussions we had related to the

698
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,000
hypocrite commits paper and this is a

699
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,919
direct reaction to this

700
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,240
so we introduced a new committee and the

701
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,919
committee is a subcommittee of the

702
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,760
program committee

703
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,559
in order to check paper for

704
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,039
ethical considerations and also subject

705
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,600
human subjects research

706
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,919
so what we did in the first step is we

707
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,080
updated the call for papers to better

708
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,960
reflect the expectations and this is a

709
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
lesson learned based on last year's

710
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,279
conference

711
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,360
in the review form we added a new

712
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,840
checkbox where reviewers could mark a

713
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
paper for ethical review

714
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
and then each of these papers that was

715
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,159
marked by at least one pc member was

716
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,559
checked by the research ethics committee

717
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
so typically one or two

718
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,200
rec members were assigned to review the

719
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,799
ethical concerns

720
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,120
these were discussed potentially also

721
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
based on feedback during the interactive

722
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
rebuttal phase and then the rec had

723
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,399
separate discussion so outside of the

724
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,559
typical pc discussions where they

725
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
discussed all these papers they also

726
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
organized video calls in order to decide

727
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,399
on recommendations

728
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,320
we had two cases where the research

729
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,399
ethics committee recommended to reject

730
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,720
papers based on ethical grounds

731
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,799
in both cases the paper was also

732
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,360
rejected based on technical crowns so

733
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,520
this was actually no real effect in

734
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,000
practice but it shows i think that the

735
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
process works

736
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,919
what we plan to do is also to do a

737
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,679
write-up on the lessons learned of

738
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
organizing the research ethics committee

739
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
for the first time because i think there

740
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,600
are some valuable lessons learned

741
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,919
by this committee that also the broader

742
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,000
community should learn especially

743
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,840
because we had many recurring types of

744
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,320
discussions related to vulnerability

745
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,799
disclosure how to treat human subjects

746
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,679
and other topics so i think

747
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,399
this

748
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,799
committee can also develop guidelines in

749
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,880
order to guide future research in this

750
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,279
area

751
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,159
okay talking about

752
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,640
papers now so here you see a word cloud

753
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,440
of all the 147 papers

754
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,399
accepted this year

755
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,399
i would just want to briefly comment on

756
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,600
two things

757
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,480
first

758
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,240
one of the keywords you see quite often

759
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,399
is attack and attacks that's basically

760
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,200
right in the middle and this is

761
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,799
i'm not sure whether i should see say

762
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
varying trend but definitely a trend i'm

763
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,880
not sure whether this is good or bad so

764
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,960
honestly i think it's a bit bad but

765
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
maybe you're

766
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
you think different about this so what

767
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,399
we see is that we have quite a few

768
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
attacks papers being submitted and also

769
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,440
accepted

770
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,320
so

771
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,559
many people spend quite a lot of time on

772
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,000
breaking stuff

773
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
while papers that propose defenses or

774
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
basically how we can protect security

775
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,399
and privacy in better ways have a harder

776
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,360
time

777
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
so i can only encourage you to also work

778
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
more on the defensive side

779
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
because i think we should not only break

780
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,159
stuff we should we as a community should

781
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,760
also make sure that people are safe and

782
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,720
secure so please also focus more on the

783
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,240
defensive side and i think we have

784
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
several great papers that propose

785
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,039
defenses or mechanisms or methods how we

786
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,039
can actually for example do private

787
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,600
computations or how we

788
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,120
can fix problems in practice

789
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
another keyword that's pride from quite

790
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,520
prominent is model so we see quite a few

791
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,600
machine learning papers and especially

792
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,279
this intersection of machine learning

793
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,960
and security is getting more and more

794
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,120
traction so i think this will also

795
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
influence our community in the next

796
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
years to come

797
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,559
then a few statistics and i will keep

798
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,320
this a bit shorter in the interest of

799
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,600
time

800
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,279
but two things that i just want to

801
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,840
mention is here is first an overview of

802
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,799
the paper topics so on the x-axis you

803
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,600
see basically the categories you see

804
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,760
that we received quite a few mission

805
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,679
learning papers then we have system

806
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,840
security and applied crypto as the top

807
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,960
three submission topics and hate and

808
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,799
harassment is

809
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,360
on the right hand side so but this is

810
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,080
for the number of submitted papers so

811
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,519
this is about the 1 000 papers

812
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,679
interestingly when we turn to the number

813
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,039
of accepted papers it changes a bit

814
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,760
so now attacks is number one as i

815
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,679
mentioned earlier we've spent probably

816
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,240
too much time on just attacking stuff

817
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,799
machine learning drops to number six so

818
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,880
it seems like many of the ml papers that

819
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,360
are submitted are eventually rejected

820
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
and

821
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
not sure what's funny about this but

822
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,760
okay great um so i love mln securities

823
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
it's not that i'm i'm dissing them no

824
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,720
it's great great work great work people

825
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
please continue

826
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
um

827
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,960
what um

828
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,720
so this is basically just a rough alpha

829
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
outline we will dig

830
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,000
deeper into the numbers and also plan to

831
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,640
hopefully write up a pc chair report but

832
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
this was an interesting statistic that i

833
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
saw

834
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,559
yes question

835
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,360
yeah this is cut cut down so this is

836
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,519
security and privacy of something so

837
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
this is not the title of the full thing

838
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
obviously

839
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,519
and then

840
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,760
one thing that i found interesting is or

841
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,840
not interesting but impressive is

842
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,880
how much

843
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,919
work is actually put here by the pc and

844
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,960
all the members so we have more than

845
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,039
3100 reviews written with close to 2

846
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,039
million words being written and more

847
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,440
than 10 000 comments so there was quite

848
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,960
a lot of commitment

849
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,480
based on the pc

850
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,799
the associate chairs the research ethics

851
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,440
committee and all people involved

852
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
what we plan to do is to

853
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,440
publish a more detailed write-up of what

854
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,360
we have learned how this also

855
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,960
corresponds to lessons learned in the

856
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,480
past years

857
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,919
this will take a bit time because it's

858
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,679
quite a bit of data that we want to

859
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,640
process

860
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,399
but

861
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,320
in case you have feedback of how author

862
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
thing can be done better feel free to

863
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,799
reach out because i think scaling our

864
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,799
community to larger numbers is something

865
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
challenging and that's something we need

866
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,240
to address in the years to come

867
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,240
and with this i would like to conclude

868
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,399
uh with a thank you for quite many

869
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,840
people who have made all of this

870
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
possible

871
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
so first they are of course all the

872
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,519
authors and speakers because without you

873
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,360
we wouldn't have this program of about

874
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,480
140 papers that will be presented in the

875
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,399
next three days

876
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,559
the pc and all the external reviewers

877
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,399
spend quite a lot of time on reviewing

878
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,159
these papers providing constructive

879
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,359
feedback so without them and without all

880
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,839
their paid unpaid work everything would

881
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,320
not have been possible

882
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
and then my special gratitude goes to

883
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
the organizing committee i already

884
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,879
mentioned rakesh and his team there were

885
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,440
many many other people for example

886
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
scott as a video chair

887
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,679
then we had mother who was preparing the

888
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,560
website we have awards we have people

889
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,599
working

890
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,359
for the posters and everything so

891
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,199
actually a lot of people who make this

892
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,480
possible with behind the scene work and

893
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,159
without all of them being involved

894
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,359
everything would not have been possible

895
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,119
then we have the technic committee with

896
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,000
brian and gabriela who provided a lot of

897
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,560
guidance especially in tricky situations

898
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,399
we have the steering committee to which

899
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
we also reached out in order to get some

900
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
clarifications on the general policy so

901
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
this was also very helpful and then of

902
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,200
course it's you

903
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
either in person or remote so we had

904
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,839
more than 700 people attending this

905
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,320
event in the next three days so thanks a

906
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,280
lot for coming for making this possible

907
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
and then there are people like

908
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
kate or

909
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
other people from executive events who

910
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
make sure that everything runs very

911
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
smoothly so thanks a lot for all these

912
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,400
organizing people and enjoy the hybrid

913
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,280

thank you

915
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:40,199
[Applause]

916
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
i think we should definitely have an

917
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,240
extra round of applause for thorson if

918
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,839
you didn't realize it's a two-year

919
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,680
service commitment thank you very much

920
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
and as with the rest of our working

921
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,359

922
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,200
the presentation stats and i get to do

923
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
the fun stuff

924
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,079
including awards

925
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,800
so

926
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,760
uh

927
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,079
we had an award selection process for

928
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,440
distinguished

929
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,960
paper awards

930
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,079
uh procedurally thorson and i

931
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,079
chaired the award selection committee

932
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
and we had a number of pc members who

933
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,000
generously donated some time to do some

934
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
extra work at the end of the review

935
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
process in the last few months to try to

936
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,200
select some papers for their overall

937
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
excellence

938
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,359
and quality

939
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,680
so we shortlisted based on uh overall

940
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,280
rankings from reviews as well as

941
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,160
nominations and had about 16 papers that

942
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,839
the committee then looked at in more

943
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,800
detail

944
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,920
to decide which ones uh were worthy of a

945
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,839
distinguished paper award and we ended

946
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,240
up with four distinguished paper awards

947
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,280
this year

948
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,119
so i'll just ask

949
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,079
that the

950
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,400
authors when i announce the paper stand

951
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
up if you're here

952
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,680
or if you're on zoom i guess you can

953
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,400
dance in your chair or whatever um

954
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,000
and uh

955
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,839
and while we give a round of applause to

956
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,160
the authors uh and then uh you can sit

957
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,800
down we'll go on to the next paper

958
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,599

959
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,560

960
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,160

in terms of the criteria so first of all

1015
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,760
test of time means that your paper is so

1016
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
good that after a while people still

1017
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,520
talking about it or still referencing

1018
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,720
your work

1019
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,119
so um for our committee

1020
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,440
our tasks is to look at

1021
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,200
papers uh from 2010 through

1022
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,119
2012. so these are three editions of the

1023
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,040
the oakland conferences at the

1024
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,920
conference and then um so that so you

1025
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,800
say what criteria do we use to decide

1026
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,880
tests of test of time award is very

1027
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,680
simple lasting impact on both research

1028
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
and practice

1029
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,680
and

1030
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,760
so they say how do you decide that a

1031
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,880
paper has

1032
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,760
a lasting impact so obviously we want to

1033
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,400
look at some objective evidence

1034
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
then we're going to rely on our

1035
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,240
experience and expertise

1036
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,160
to discuss uh so that we don't let our

1037
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,079
you know uh subjective opinion um

1038
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,920
take control uh so

1039
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,240
so what i did was um

1040
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,400
i inherited a set of guidelines and and

1041
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,960
documents from the previous committees

1042
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,720
the committees of the previous years so

1043
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,440
essentially we are essentially following

1044
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
basically the same set of

1045
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
criteria and process

1046
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,839
i add a little bit to say that

1047
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,079
let's be more concrete when we talk

1048
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,880
about objective evidence so what i did

1049
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,760
was

1050
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,960
for all the three

1051
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
conferences i mean the three editions of

1052
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,319
the conference i actually looked at all

1053
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,960
the papers and then

1054
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
and then i created a list of uh you know

1055
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,079
for each paper i essentially i use a

1056
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,440
google scholar to find out the um

1057
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,359
citation counts so i provided the whole

1058
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,440
committee a list of papers and the

1059
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
citation counts and tell them that hey

1060
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,200
look we should use this as a you know

1061
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,760
essential starting point so that when we

1062
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
say this paper is good at least we can

1063
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,000
point to say hey look look i mean some

1064
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,839
evidence that this paper has been

1065
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,240
referenced many times but that's only

1066
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,640
one of the criteria that we use

1067
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,319
like as it's only starting point that we

1068
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,000
rely on our

1069
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,880
expertise and and uh being active

1070
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,800
research in the field we essentially

1071
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,920
discuss why this paper is good okay so

1072
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
so those are the

1073
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,400
um how we set it up and in terms of the

1074
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,240
the more detailed process

1075
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,880
uh one thing that we uh try to make sure

1076
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,400
we can do is uh

1077
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,240
make sure that we want to avoid uh

1078
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
potential conflict of interest

1079
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,200
like i said we are you know we we are

1080
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,599
from many different places so we have

1081
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,000
collaborators sometimes our own papers

1082
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,920
so i told committee members that they

1083
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,400
should send their nomination directly to

1084
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
me so that it does you know doesn't have

1085
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,119
to be out in open initially so once i

1086
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,920
have the uh list of nominations

1087
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,280
from the committee members now share

1088
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,200
with them i share with the committee

1089
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,520
then we essentially you know uh vote to

1090
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
say hey which you know what let's say

1091
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,680
top one top three or top two top three

1092
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,079
papers and then we discuss and they make

1093
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,079
a final decision that's the process that

1094
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,680
we agree upon

1095
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,480
uh in reality it went a lot smoother

1096
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,640
than i wanted to describe

1097
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,160
i think i think when i presented

1098
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,440
in the next few slides you would

1099
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,880
understand what what i'm talking about

1100
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
so basically

1101
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
the papers that really started that

1102
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,359
should uh should get this awards they're

1103
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,280
essentially getting a unanimous or near

1104
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,800
unanimous votes

1105
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,720
so they almost okay we're done there's

1106
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,240
no need to

1107
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,160
discuss it's that simple

1108
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,119
um

1109
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,240
so um so with that i'm going to

1110
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,520
move to the next slide tom please

1111
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,040
okay it's one of the awards slides are

1112
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,079
you ready for that

1113
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,319
yeah okay everybody everybody should be

1114
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,920
here to say thank you shut up let's

1115
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,160
let's get to the world okay here we go

1116
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,839
here we go

1117
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,599
yeah so so i'm going to present

1118
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,920
essentially chronological order reverse

1119
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,079
chronological order so the first one is

1120
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,040
uh

1121
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,520
the mayhem paper in 2012

1122
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,839
so this is actually a great paper i mean

1123
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,440
so actually i use some of the materials

1124
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,000
in my in my lecture slides uh i mean

1125
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
nobody's gonna

1126
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,520
to say that's not cool i mean i think

1127
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
everybody should should say that's cool

1128
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,960
that somebody read your paper and they

1129
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,800
incorporate materials in in in their

1130
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,280
lectures so this paper is about you know

1131
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,000
um let me look at binary uh say hey

1132
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,280
there's vulnerability how do you know

1133
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,800
the vulnerability actually is serious or

1134
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,119
actionable so the main hand paper talks

1135
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,359
about hey when i tell you about report i

1136
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,440
actually accompanied the probably

1137
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,040
actually exploitable uh uh

1138
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,400
with a real attack meaning that hey

1139
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,800
here's a here's the input that you can

1140
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,359
you can uh cause the export meaning that

1141
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,040
you can't just spawn a shell that's a

1142
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,839
big deal uh so so really that's born a

1143
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,040
lot of follow following work in um on

1144
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,079
malware

1145
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,640
in software security analysis attack

1146
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,880
defense you know the data grant

1147
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,480
challenge you name it in terms of

1148
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,880
techniques the authors did a great job

1149
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,200
uh in terms of saying that hey how do we

1150
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,880
make sure that when we are using symbol

1151
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,040
execution or call execution we can

1152
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,359
actually achieve both accuracy and

1153
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,280
scalability and and

1154
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,000
efficiency that's awesome paper uh is

1155
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,319
really everybody on the company really

1156
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,800
uh love this paper so

1157
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,640
with that so tom do we have the um

1158
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,240
authors coming up or we wait until the

1159
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,400
last uh

1160
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,839

yeah that's really great congrats again

1164
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,440
like i said this is a great paper and i

1165
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,319
use it in my lectures as well okay tom

1166
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,839
can we go to the next slide

1167
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,880
please right ready

1168
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,760
yep great so so now uh 2011 this uh this

1169
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,880
uh

1170
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,920
uh

1171
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,040
essentially

1172
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
i mean this is a again this is an area

1173
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,160
that a lot of people

1174
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,000
felt like wow this is amazing piece of

1175
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,480
work uh talking about how to analyze the

1176
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,319
uh essentially

1177
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,160
uh the question that people

1178
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,520
talk about spams are people sending

1179
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,359
instruments so annoying but why would

1180
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,280
they send spam how do they make money so

1181
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,200
all those questions actually i think

1182
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,640
this is one of the first paper that did

1183
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,240
a very systematic study

1184
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,599
of the whole value chain uh behind spam

1185
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,839
and and also you know multiple

1186
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,000
uh parties uh in this whole

1187
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,520
infrastructure i'm not talking about the

1188
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,319
technical infrastructure such as writing

1189
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,200
uh exploits or you know dropping malware

1190
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
or the the hosting infrastructure i'm

1191
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,280
talking about the actual value chain the

1192
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,599
the money trail so this really awesome

1193
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,599
piece of work again i actually use a

1194
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,920
whole you know i use eye dag in my one

1195
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,440
of my uh

1196
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,280
in my in my class

1197
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,359
uh that's one of the favorite uh

1198
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,599
lectures that students really enjoy

1199
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,680
uh again this also spawned a ton of

1200
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,599
follow-up work not just by the same

1201
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,000
group but also by many other researchers

1202
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,359
looking at you know sort of the economic

1203
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,720
factors

1204
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,440
and what we can do uh in addition to

1205
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
this technical means to counter these

1206
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,079
kind of internet scale

1207
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,839
threats and thoughts so again great

1208
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,240
piece of work really congratulations

1209
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,319
thank you i think i think that jeff and

1210
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,599
nick will be

1211
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
there so let's have the

1212
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
authors come up to receive the awards

1213
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,760
please

1214
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,880

[Applause]

1216
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,079
great congrats again uh so uh next slide

1217
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,319
please

1218
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,240
ah ready

1219
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,359
okay great

1220
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,119
so um

1221
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,599
so the next slide so again we uh

1222
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,599
we actually we love the paper so much

1223
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,480
that we we decided to uh to give a three

1224
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,800
words so this is the last of course not

1225
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,680
the least so this is science uh so so

1226
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,319
again actually i talked to agent a lot

1227
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,079
about this paper like almost every time

1228
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,839
we met at a conference we would talk

1229
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,119
about this paper

1230
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,200
and uh you know i keep repeating this

1231
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,240
actually i'm using some of these

1232
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
materials in my lecture as well so a lot

1233
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,760
of what we do in security is about

1234
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,559
patching patching stuff i'm sure

1235
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,480
agent felt the same way about internet

1236
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,200
security routing security so so again in

1237
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,599
2011 they have this science uh science

1238
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,800
paper

1239
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,400
essentially talks about

1240
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,680
essentially a new kind of internet

1241
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,960
architecture

1242
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,280
where you have explicit trust so using

1243
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,240
chest domains to essentially uh isolate

1244
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
and negotiate uh

1245
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,160
some of these routing

1246
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,559
decisions so that you can provide

1247
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,880
resilience and better security and i

1248
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,319
would say that

1249
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,280
you know i know uh by talking to adrian

1250
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,599
that he's actually taking this into

1251
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,400
practice i mean he has star you know uh

1252
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
technology technology transfer

1253
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,079
efforts and start company and pushing

1254
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,240
this technology so really i think this

1255
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
is actually one of those one of the very

1256
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,920
few examples where

1257
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,000
the work is not just academically

1258
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,720
outstanding but

1259
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,440
but

1260
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,119
it is actually going to make a huge

1261
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,440
impact in practice so again

1262
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,800
congratulations

1263
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,400
i think agent is going to

1264
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,880
come up together get the award as well

1265
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,119
