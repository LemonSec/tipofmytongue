1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
again thank you

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,600
yeah thank you ian for the introduction

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
good morning my name is xiao jiang james

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,399
stu

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,480
i'm a professor at the stevens institute

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,559
of technology today we're going to i'm

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,240
going to present

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
the work that done with my student how

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,839
shi

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
chen longfu and my collaborator chanzan

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,039
so the title is called the delay rack

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,279
talk on your smart home

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,920
which is a delay-based automation

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,640
interference attacks

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
so we all know from familiar with smart

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,079
homes i'll go quickly smart homes we can

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
use for remote monitoring control you

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,040
can do voice control and also they

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,280
provide data virtualization most

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
importantly provide home automation

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,079
this particular work

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,879
actually utilizes another work from our

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
group which is called iot phantom delay

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,320
attack

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,800
the fentanyl attack worker was actually

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,120
done before this attack but the due

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,760
diligence reason was uh

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,159
published later than this one so it will

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,760
appear next month in dsn 2022 okay next

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
month okay so i will briefly mention

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
this uh fenton delay attack which is a

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
stepping stone for the

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
attacks in this paper okay so in

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,840
defendant delay attack what we found is

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
that the timeout detection implemented

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,159
in the current

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,360
iot tcp layers is decoupled from the

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,600
data protection provided by the tls

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
layer okay and we did the experiment we

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
found out that actually an attacker

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
could for both the iot device as well as

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,960
the server or cloud platform

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,799
to believe that

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,880
sessions is still healthy while the

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
attacker is delaying the iot event

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
message or command message

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
ranging from

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,759
tens of seconds up to several hours we

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,479
experimented on more than 50 popular iot

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
devices

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
and

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,520
although the integrity integrity is

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
still protected by tos okay

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,399
so the most important feature of this

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
attack it does not utilize any

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
implementation

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
vulnerability

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,920
it actually is very stealthy such that

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
it does not cause any alarm

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
from any layer of the iot protocol

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
due to the time reason i will not be

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
able to talk too much about this attack

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,920
but if you're interested please pay

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
attention to our upcoming uh

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
presentation the dsn in the paper okay

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
so again this is the stepping stone for

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
our work in this paper okay

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
so with the delay attack basically the

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
the fenton delay attack will delay iot

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,519
event message or command for ranging

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,160
again from uh dozens of seconds to even

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
hours okay with the delay attack

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
we found there are two issues one is

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
called the disorder the other is called

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,879
inconsistency i'll explain those issues

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,360
so basically we categorize those iot

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
systems into three categories for smart

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,640
homes for smart home if the user usually

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,120
have a bunch of iot devices if the user

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
only use one platform say

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,040
smartsync or you know google or alexa

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
whatever one platform

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
and all the devices using one

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
communication path this is called a

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
single platform single pass there's no

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,120
such problem okay

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
another category is

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,799
okay the user has a bunch of iot devices

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
at home and he still only uses one

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,000
platform

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
however there are different devices

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
there are wi-fi devices directly

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,480
connected to wi-fi router zigbee z-wave

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
and bluetooth and also google has the

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
trend

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
protocol they connect to a hub first and

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
then hub connect to the wireless router

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,799
and then

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,239
going up so those are we refer to

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,080
multi-pass

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
scenario in this case

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
uh the problem is the order of the

103
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
messages may not be preserved let me

104
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
give you a simple example device

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,239
generate an event like a motion event

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
first and then device b say

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,799
during another event later

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,400
however if

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
the delay attack delay this link

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,920
then the

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,400
event one actually will arrive the

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,238
platform later okay so basically let's

113
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,720
change the order of the message okay

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,759
um

115
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,918
the third case is the user which is more

116
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,720
often i'll show you the survey uh

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,919
user uses multiple iot platforms at home

118
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,680
including for example samsung smart

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
things

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
alexa

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
apple

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,080
and so on iftd so this is called the

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
multi-platform and those

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
scenarios there are not only the order

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
issue but also the inconsistency issue

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
i'll just explain the inconsistent issue

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,400
to you which is very straightforward so

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
look at this example i have a remote

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,919
smart plug i turn it on okay and it will

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,440
send a state update to the cloud so

131
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,080
the wim cloud will show its own now but

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
if i launch a text to delete any link

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,880
here

134
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,759
then

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,880
the

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
status on will be delayed and the smart

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
thing platform will not receive the only

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
status it was still showing the plug is

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
off so basically even though the plug

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
right now is on this is showing how this

141
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,039
is zeroing off so

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
two different platforms um

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,479
managing the same device showing

144
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,400
different status this is what we call

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
the you know consistent issue so those

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,680
are the main

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,280
two main issues that

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,080
uh

149
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
enabled the

150
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
attacks that we present in the paper

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,199
okay

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
so basically based on

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,479
those

154
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,919
discoveries

155
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,479
let me first talk about this so we did

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,199
the

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
user study through amazon mechanic turf

158
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
so the purpose is to find out the real

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,919
deployment in real smart homes okay

160
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,000
including iot devices what platform they

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,960
use and automation apps and so on so we

162
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
already did that and we found out

163
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
from about 85 users that

164
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,319
most users do use multiple platforms

165
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,199
okay so about sixty two percent user

166
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
uses multiple platforms

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,199
and about twenty percent use the single

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
platform but the different passes like

169
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
they have wi-fi device so they have

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,479
zigbee zero and so on okay so as you can

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,919
see they add together like the more than

172
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,360
80 percent user use either multi-pass or

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
multi-platform which could have the

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
attack that i'm going to talk about okay

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,560
so this just shows you the for the

176
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,680
multi-platforms like most serious two

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
and like some use

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
three and about ten percent use four and

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
more okay

180
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,759
all right

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
so again with this uh

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
there are two uh main reasons one is the

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,759
phantom delay attack which we published

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,759
in another paper and the other reason is

185
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
the multi-pass or multi-platform uh it's

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
we find out that there are those what we

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
so-called delay-based automation

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
interference attack in short we call the

189
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,919
dai attack

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,440
there are some

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,639
difference

192
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
important difference from the

193
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,400
cross-rule interference

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
i don't have time to explain that right

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
now okay so but if you're interesting

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
ask me

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
so let me give you an example i'll use

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,919
this example okay

199
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,800
so the user has two platform a and b

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
each platform there's a one rule let's

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,199
say this is rule one rule one is when

202
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,280
the user leaves home he set the home

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
motor to be away and then when he drives

204
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,479
car away

205
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,039
and the rule will you know check this is

206
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,800
a trigger this is the condition if the

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,479
user away drives away it will

208
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,000
automatically close the garage door this

209
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
is the rule one rule two is the one

210
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
on a different platform when the garage

211
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
door is closed

212
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
and if the user is away i'm gonna also

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
make sure the front door is locked okay

214
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
so those are two different rules running

215
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,840
on different platforms

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
so what the attack could happen is

217
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,400
the the attacker could delay

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,759
the uh user away message on platform b

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,560
okay

220
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,720
so the user away message was

221
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,479
not sent to platform b

222
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
okay and then platform b will check

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,400
condition it does not satisfy it will

224
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
not lock the front door which means when

225
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,400
the user left the home the front door is

226
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
left open okay could it could be left

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
open so that's one example

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
uh in this research we did the

229
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
systematic study of the dai attack and

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
we used some formulation and we

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
categorize those di attack into seven

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
categories and summarize the in this

233
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
table and in the paper unfortunately i

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
don't have time to explain each one in

235
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
very detail so basically we look at the

236
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
because as you know for the home

237
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
automation rules typically use the

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
trigger condition action uh

239
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
you know

240
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,279
triplet and based on those combinations

241
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,560
whether they're overlapping where

242
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
they're conflicting and so on we

243
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,720
categorize into seven categories

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
uh and the main issue being explored are

245
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,399
the two issues i mentioned inconsistency

246
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,800
and disorder and sometimes directly from

247
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,519
the delay like the you can actually

248
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,080
attack and delay a command sent to the

249
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
iot device like lock the door or

250
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,600
send the fire alarm stuff like that okay

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,440
so the consequences could be either some

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
intended wanted action being

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,880
canceled out not executed or there could

254
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,680
be unwanted chain execution or there

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,480
could be infinite loop or like it could

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
be some two action usually should be

257
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
a happen first b happened second but

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
due to the attack that the two action

259
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
could have different orders

260
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
so

261
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
i will explain uh like three in details

262
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,240
okay again i don't have time to go

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
through each one okay

264
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
so let's look at some example in detail

265
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
this is one of them called the condition

266
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
overlapping attack i'll start with the

267
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
example and then summarize the attack

268
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,519
okay

269
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,080
so in this uh example again there are

270
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
two platforms the user uses two

271
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
platforms platform a there's a rule says

272
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
when motion detected either investment

273
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,320
or in the in the house

274
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
and if the user is at home turn off the

275
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,480
camera for like a privacy issue for

276
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
private reason

277
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
the other rule running on platform b

278
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,200
is when there's motion detected in the

279
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
house and if the user away then there's

280
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
something wrong right and then i should

281
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
like send alarm and the notified user

282
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,480
and so on or send the

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
security video to either the user or the

284
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,959
security company so those are two rules

285
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,440
what attack could happen is

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
when the user left the home

287
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
the attacker could delay the user away

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
message that's sent to platform a so in

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,760
this case on platform a

290
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,519
on the cloud is still showing on local

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,000
server it's still showing user status at

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,720
home so it'll shut down the camera and

293
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,120
which will prevent the

294
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
second rule on platform b from executing

295
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,399
and if there's some burglar or intruder

296
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
get in then it will not be

297
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,519
kept captured by the camera so that's

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
the condition overlapping attack and

299
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
this kind of attack would not happen in

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,640
the normal situation because as you can

301
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,279
see they have the same trigger they have

302
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
a different condition if they are on the

303
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
same platform it should not happen uh

304
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,399
you know both

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
at the same time okay however if they're

306
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
running on the different platform and

307
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,480
also if there's a delay attack then this

308
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
could happen okay

309
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
so

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
i'm going to skip the summarizing okay

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
so let me go to the next uh example the

312
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,399
other exam example i want to present to

313
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,440
you is

314
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
called action disordering a tag

315
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
in this case i see i only have three

316
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,920
minutes left i'll skip this one i'll

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
talk about next one okay next one is a

318
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
little bit more interesting so this is

319
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
called condition enabling attack in this

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,839
case there's still two rules uh one rule

321
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,480
is

322
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
the user setup when he come back home

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
and so he first will enter

324
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
the house and then the door will be

325
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
front door be locked closed and then the

326
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,680
home was in away mode then the rule will

327
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,079
you know set home to the home mode and

328
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,680
the closed garage door say that's the

329
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,959
evening okay

330
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
and the other rule is running on

331
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
different platform is called when the

332
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
user leaves the home it will be

333
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
used it's when

334
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,680
user after user left at home and the

335
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
front door closed

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
and it was in the home mode and then

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
you know it will open the garage so

338
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,880
the user can drive the car out and then

339
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,680
and so on okay so what could happen is

340
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,720
say when the owner is back home and

341
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,279
again the home was set away mode

342
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,160
then

343
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,639
both this two rules will be triggered

344
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,839
because

345
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,959
you know this happened okay

346
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,800
the attack happens is

347
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
the attacker could delay the front door

348
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
closed event to platform b so this has

349
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
been delayed it's not executed

350
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
immediately this is being executed and

351
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,519
it's set to the home mode and it delay

352
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,880
like say

353
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
20 seconds or 60 seconds and then

354
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,720
release it okay and then when the rule 3

355
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
receive the delayed uh door open message

356
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
you're around this rule and the home

357
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
mode already is set to home and landing

358
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,959
will open the garage so what happens is

359
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,360
when after user come home during night

360
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,440
the garage door will left open so that's

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
a safety issue okay

362
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,839
i'm running out of time so i'm going to

363
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,880
go fast so we evaluated the da attack

364
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,519
using two real smart home test pad those

365
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,240
are the technology uh the configuration

366
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,440
of testbed

367
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,279
with those numbers are representing

368
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
different iot device we bought a

369
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
commercial device okay

370
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,079
for the two test bed we use a total of

371
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,480
55 iot devices connecting to six

372
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
cloud-based platforms including smart

373
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,920
things amazon alexa wemo and so on and

374
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
two local platforms including apple

375
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,399
homekit and philip hughes and we

376
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
installed a total of 36 automation rules

377
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
those rules are obtained from the

378
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
official app store and from existing

379
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,839
papers iot papers all from the

380
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,560
existing iot foreign so those are not

381
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,240
like we randomly made up those rules

382
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,839
okay

383
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
okay so

384
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,720
those are part of the rules again i

385
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
don't have time to go through it sorry

386
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
um

387
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
so we validated several things

388
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,959
um

389
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
first we measure the the actual delay

390
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,480
that

391
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,079
could be caused

392
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,800
for different kind of da attack those

393
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,320
are different attack

394
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,279
type

395
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,320
and those are what kind of like a iot

396
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
event or command command being delayed

397
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,440
including like a motion active event

398
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,199
door close event

399
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,079
user away mode set and so on okay and

400
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,240
this tells you you know what channel to

401
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,959
delay it we implement all those okay

402
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,199
and those are the delay range depend on

403
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
several you know factors

404
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,639
so

405
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
anyway

406
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,079
so the delay ranges from 10 seconds up

407
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,800
to

408
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,720
like 600 seconds and for the apple

409
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,320
right now their implementation if

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
there's an event being sent to the local

411
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,880
server they don't send acknowledgement

412
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,600
so

413
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,720
for this

414
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,639
case you can delay for as long as you

415
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,519
want i mean uh so it could be tested

416
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
like up to 40 minutes or even longer

417
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
okay

418
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,839
and we validated all the seven

419
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,880
categories of da attack in our test bed

420
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
uh with one experiment is without attack

421
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,880
everything runs normal okay so like the

422
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,399
lock is supposed to be locked it got

423
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,600
locked

424
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
in the garage door lock got locked

425
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
and if there's an attack then where's

426
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,880
the

427
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,639
things could happen like the garage door

428
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,480
is not locked

429
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,240
or the

430
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,839
outlet is supposed to be turned on but

431
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,519
it turned off after like two seconds the

432
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
heater turned on which messed up the the

433
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,480
what the user wanted and in this case

434
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,040
the camera turned on uh after like over

435
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
500 seconds this is because the delay

436
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
attack okay it's supposed to be turned

437
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,079
on like immediately so anyway

438
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,759
we violated all the

439
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,040
da attacks and all being validated

440
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,279
the other experiment we did is

441
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,920
we also measured the attack

442
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,880
opportunities and the success rate

443
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,000
over a week and this is the summary for

444
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,600
some of the tax

445
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
the success rate is pretty high

446
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
but some of them are not like always you

447
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,160
can have the attack

448
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
again depends on the configuration the

449
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
user activity and so on and most

450
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
importantly uh so some of the hacks you

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,199
need to delay to be like

452
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
long enough like a 20 second or 15

453
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,160
seconds sometimes so such that all the

454
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
conditions satisfy okay so not

455
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,920
all uh are that high success rate okay

456
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,399
but over the time you know even with 50

457
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,959
percent once in a while the attacker

458
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,480
will have opportunity to launch the

459
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,079
attack okay

460
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
okay so i think i'm

461
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,559
almost done so uh this paper mainly

462
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,760
presented the new set of uh tags on

463
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,400
almost all the iot devices that we

464
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
tested well all the devices testers have

465
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,359
this vulnerability but we did not test

466
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,119
all the iot devices because there's tens

467
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,959
of thousands okay

468
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,160
so we proposed some simple preliminary

469
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
possible content measurement like from

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
the user side

471
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,000
if possible the user could isolate their

472
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
iot using a different wi-fi network from

473
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
other users last year like the same

474
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
wi-fi network from the vendor side they

475
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,840
could revise the iot protocol such as

476
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
reduce the keep alive

477
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,039
time and the timeout limit so to reduce

478
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,480
the attack window

479
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
and from the researcher point of view

480
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,559
like us we could think about what kind

481
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,720
of approach we can use to detect the

482
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
potential conflicting automation rules

483
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,240
again those automation rules if you look

484
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
at them you don't see any problem but

485
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
because delay attack and the multi-pass

486
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
multi platform

487
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,360
that could be those serious problems

488
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
okay so let me summarize that

489
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,799
so again uh

490
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,039
okay we disclosed that this won't be to

491
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,760
a number of iot vendors including google

492
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,280
uh apple simply save for ring and so on

493
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,640
and uh

494
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,919
several companies acknowledge the

495
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,240
problem like google they awarded us five

496
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,799
hundred dollars uh and simply saved in

497
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,960
the ring they actually

498
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
they tested themselves and they they

499
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
found that they do have this problem and

500
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,000
they said they're gonna improve their

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
protocol okay so let me summarize my

502
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
talk okay so basically we utilize the

503
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,120
primitive which is the fenton delay

504
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,720
attack which is

505
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,039
our another paper this which is a

506
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,200
stepping stone based on stepping stone

507
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,760
and based on multi-pass multi-platform

508
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,640
we found their disorder and

509
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,960
inconsistency issue and based on that we

510
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
found another family of new attacks

511
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
which called the dai attack on

512
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
automation rule which could cause

513
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,039
serious consequences on smart homes

514
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,280
including door opening fires and so on

515
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
and if we evaluate it onto real world

516
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
testbed

517
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
we propose some simple preliminary

518
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
counter measurement that's all thank you

519
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
so thanks xiao jiang there is one

520
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
question from online like kushar kumar

521
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
asked

522
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
all the categories of attacks observed

523
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
in all platforms for example google home

524
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
kit

525
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
have you identified any devices that are

526
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,360
resistant to these attacks

527
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,520
again we tested like uh 50 different

528
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,640
devices for the device we tested

529
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
they are vulnerable to those attacks but

530
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,400
uh i don't want to say

531
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,960
uh you know it works for every device

532
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,559
i'm not 100 sure there could be

533
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,280
exceptions uh yeah again there's tens of

534
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,000
thousands iot devices so

535
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,880
uh but based on the popular device we

536
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,320
tested that they all worked

537
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
thanks for talking uh chairwoman from

538
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,039
rsu i have a question about

539
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,360
uh can you talk about about how you

540
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
implement the attack do you send the

541
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,559
jamming signals and how long the delay

542
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,280
uh how long delay the attack should be

543
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,960
okay okay so this basically um

544
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
is the the question for the other paper

545
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,679
but i can briefly answer it uh it's not

546
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,360
the jamming exec it's totally different

547
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,039
from jimmy and tiger the main difference

548
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
is we're not discarding the packet we're

549
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
just holding the packet and we will

550
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
at some point release the packet

551
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,440
and

552
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
the the server side or the iot site will

553
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,960
receive the message and there's no alarm

554
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,919
timeout being caused okay jamming is you

555
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,799
jam it the packet got dropped uh but

556
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,240
and then you have to reset stuff like

557
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
that disconnect reset but in our case

558
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,760
the attack

559
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
uh the package has never been dropped

560
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,440
but the factory will be delivered at

561
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
some point

562
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,760
and

563
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
the other party the receiver side does

564
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,159
not notice any problem okay so that's

565
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,919
the one main difference

566
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,799
um

567
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,799
how to implement attack let's remove a

568
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,200
lot of details uh maybe you can contact

569
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
me offline and i can send you the other

570
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
paper it takes a lot of time to explain

571
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,080
the details yeah thank you i want to ask

572
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
how long the delay should be the attack

573
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,120
because uh okay you know the the iot

574
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,679
slave iot devices they report

575
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,080
periodically their status to the master

576
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
device yeah and when the for example

577
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,600
activator close the door and after it

578
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,679
complete the task it would report the

579
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
status so yeah the delay consider

580
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
this

581
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
yeah we consider all this factor we

582
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,960
again we experiment on uh 50 popular iot

583
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
devices

584
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
those are the some of the range the

585
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,360
short one could be like 10 seconds at

586
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
the longer one to 600 seconds and as i

587
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
mentioned some of the apple devices you

588
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,280
can delete at least 40 minutes

589
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
or even longer yeah so it depends on the

590
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,039
device depending on their timeout

591
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,880
mechanism keep a live

592
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
session and so on yeah yeah

593
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
thank you sure thank you so thanks

594
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
xiaojiang and thanks everyone for the

595
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
questions there are actually more

596
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
questions online maybe shut down you can

597
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
address them like oh blend and if you

598
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
like anyone else want to ask questions

599
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,799
you can talk to the author of line

600
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
because we are really running behind

601
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,159
yeah

602
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,840
okay thank you thank you
