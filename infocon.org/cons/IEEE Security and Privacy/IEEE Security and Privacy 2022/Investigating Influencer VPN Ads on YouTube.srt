00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,839
session but welcome to my talk uh i'm

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
omer uh this is going to be uh the

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,400
presentation i'm gonna make titled

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
infinite skating influencer vpn ads on

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
youtube uh these are all my co-authors

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,279
richard moses dave and michelle moses

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,359
was at clemson he just graduated the

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,720
rest of us are at the university of

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
maryland

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,039
now a common goal or one of the common

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,880
goals of the usable security community

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
in the past couple years was to

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,200
understand mental models or what users

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
understand of security and privacy tools

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,040
we think we found another influence on

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
mental models of security and privacy

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
namely these influencer vpn ads now i'm

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
sure a lot of you have seen these uh if

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
you watch youtube but these are

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,680
essentially ads created by the the

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,840
creators of the videos themselves put

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
directly inside the videos not served by

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
youtube um and they talk about a lot of

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
stuff i'll show you an example just just

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
in case you haven't seen any this is

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,400
gonna be by a youtuber called dj cook

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,799
with a respectable 1.5 million

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,040
subscribers and the videos about

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
fortnite uh but it has a vpn ad in it

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
and i want you to watch it so let's

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,360
watch

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,119
now the title of this video is meet the

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,600
fortnite scammers and nordvpn picked the

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,720
best video to sponsor because a vpn can

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
easily prevent you from being scammed

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
and no i'm not talking about on fortnite

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
but even worse maybe your credit card

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
information is stored on a website

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
somebody could get into that

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
if you have nordvpn you don't have to

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
worry

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,439
yeah so i i've got news uh vpn is not

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,479
going to protect your credit cards

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,479
that's stored on a server somewhere else

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,799
uh so that's that's misleading there

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,119
it's a privacy thing with a boatload of

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,600
other benefits i promise if you go ahead

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
and give northvpn a try you won't ever

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,280
have to worry about anything on the

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
internet again you'll be safe one of my

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
friends actually uses nordvpn and it's

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
made his internet experience way better

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,240
he doesn't have to worry about anything

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
and he can do what he wants

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,679
okay again clear overstatement a vpn is

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,599
not going to give you all the the

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
security and privacy you want in the

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
world

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
download nordvpn from the link in the

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,680
description

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
okay so this is a clear ad and

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
unfortunately we saw a lot of crazy

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,560
statements being made in here and as our

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,720
results will just show in a second uh

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
these are not this is not an isolated

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,640
example of vpn ads on youtube

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
in fact they're quite widespread this

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
one alone got 1.1 million views

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
and what's more concerning is that they

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
have an educational tone to them they're

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
almost teaching you what internet

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
security and privacy should be what a

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
vpn should give you

76
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,959
even more concerning is looking at the

77
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,800
uh the prior work mental models of

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
security and privacy tools researchers

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
have been looking at this for a while

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,200
especially in the context of

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
instant messenger

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,879
instead instant secure messaging and now

83
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,800
vpns because people are starting to use

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
those and they ask questions such as do

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
people understand what they're using do

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
they understand the guarantees of the

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,239
tools that they're using and are they

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
using them correctly and the answer

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
turns out to be no in a lot of cases

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
and so we think that this influence on

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,840
vpn mental models and more more broadly

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,680
uh security and privacy mental models is

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
could potentially be a bad one

94
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
so that's why we investigated them uh

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,239
and uh we had a couple goals in mind uh

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,680
we wanted to measure the prevalence of

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,599
these ads so how many of them are there

98
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,680
are out there what's the what's the

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,040
reach

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
we want to characterize what they said

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
so what's in them what's being actually

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,319
portrayed

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
and we want our results to be uh

104
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,959
generalizable and not just anecdotal so

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
we design our methodology with that in

106
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
mind and we analyze once we get the

107
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,640
videos that we want to analyze with the

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
vpn ads in them we analyze them through

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
qualitative means which essentially

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,120
means we sat through and systematically

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
watched and labeled all the vpn ads that

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
we found

113
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
now in order to do that we need to first

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,680
find the vpn ads and this is roughly how

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
we did it we first start off with all of

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
youtube that's that's all of youtube

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,439
trust me

118
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,920
and we use this thing called a random

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,400
prefix sample which essentially allows

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
you to get a random sample of youtube in

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,918
our case uh we got about 87 million

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,880
videos about 1.4 of youtube according to

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
our estimates by the end of 2020. uh if

124
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
you want any details on this it's in the

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
paper it's another paper from 10 years

126
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
ago

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,919
now

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,160
that sample is great 87 million that's a

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,919
lot of videos but where are the vpn ads

130
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,520
in them well this is how we found the

131
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,360
vpn ads we downloaded the english videos

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
subtitles first and then we searched for

133
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,880
vpn in this and this works surprisingly

134
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
well but it gives us a noisy candidate

135
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
data set of about 1700 videos which we

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
then sat down and watched systematically

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
and we

138
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
found what a vpn ad is we got we got

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,759
about 243 vpn ads in videos uh that's

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,320
about 63 million views we also labeled

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
what was in them while we were doing

142
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,919
this and because remember this is a

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
random sample because it's a random

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
sample you can scale it up to all of

145
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
youtube which means by the end of 2020

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,080
there were about 16 000 videos on

147
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
youtube that had vpn ads in them with

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
billions upon billions of views in total

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
so quite a widespread reach there

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,560
they're getting

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,479
now with label like i said we labeled

152
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
all this all these videos uh

153
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,639
what do we do with it exactly what's the

154
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,080
analysis

155
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
we looked at the obvious question what

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
did the video say

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,360
we looked at the more problematic claims

158
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
what can a vpn actually provide you

159
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
versus what's being claimed it can

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
provide you

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
we looked at changes over time so vpn

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
ads seem to appear

163
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,400
about in 2016 how does that compare to

164
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
end of 2020

165
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,880
and finally um

166
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
i'm just going to get rid of this mask

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
and finally we compare different vpn

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
companies to each other are they do they

169
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,840
have the same thing advertised

170
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
about

171
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
vpns

172
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,759
i won't talk about all of them but i'll

173
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,199
go through some

174
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,280
let's start off with what's in a vpn ad

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
one of the more surprising findings we

176
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
had is that vpns are often pitched as a

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,199
content consumption tool

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
in this case renee says stream your

179
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
country's streaming services and get

180
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
access to all those titles referring to

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,479
the case where you're traveling your

182
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
streaming service you're using is how

183
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,880
uses uh jira restrictions to separate

184
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
libraries between countries and you want

185
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
your home country's library

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
unsurprisingly a lot of it is about

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
utility uh for security and privacy uh

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,800
these include technical claims this

189
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
person says

190
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,240
and a vpn service encrypts your

191
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
connection and provides you with

192
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
anonymous ip

193
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,759
we saw a lot of broad claims such as

194
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
this one you're completely anonymous

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
again if you use a vpn of course

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,639
and finally threat statements we found

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,919
these quite interesting here's an

198
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,319
example hackers can exploit unsecured

199
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
connections to get inside your system

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
now because we found this so it's so

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
interesting we wanted to dig deeper and

202
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
this is how we did it

203
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
so this is a vpn ad

204
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,000
and here's what they say in the ad at

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,759
some point your internet service

206
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
provider can see every single website

207
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,199
you visited

208
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
the way we label these is in three parts

209
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,319
we start off with the adversary the

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
internet service provider in this case

211
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,440
what they do

212
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,479
they see

213
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,400
and finally the asset they're going

214
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
after in this case it's your browsing

215
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,440
history they say every single website

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,759
you visited because we did this labeling

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
we were able to distill the threat model

218
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
conveyed by youtube through these vpn

219
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
ads to all the users so we we identified

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
common adversaries what they do and the

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,120
assets

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
let's look at some of these in more

223
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
detail let's follow these flows

224
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
the isb it seems like the isb mostly

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
does surveillance and a little bit of

226
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
dissemination that's essentially selling

227
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
and what they're selling or or

228
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,199
surveilling is your interactivity for

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,400
the most part

230
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
you know that makes sense

231
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
let's look at the government

232
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
the government is similar but but

233
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,759
different in a unique way

234
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
it again surveils for the most part

235
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
but this time it's you your yourself or

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
everything it's more broad seemingly

237
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,719
more powerful

238
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
finally let's look at the hacker and the

239
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
vague adversary the vague adversary is

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
just you know the people or the mean

241
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,080
people or whatever it's vague but it's

242
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
very similar to the hacker you can see

243
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
that these guys are all over the place

244
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,799
they do everything

245
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,640
but one thing i want to

246
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,120
attract your attention to is

247
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
they do this forcefully take thing which

248
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,399
is essentially just saying they're

249
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
stealing or grabbing they're taking it

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
from you

251
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
and these are mostly your passwords your

252
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
credit card information you can see uh

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,839
some of the lesser

254
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,760
frequent examples or your device sensors

255
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
such as your webcam your microphone so

256
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
quite alarming stuff that they're um

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
conveying here

258
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
that and and the implication is that

259
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
well the

260
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
what they imply in these videos is that

261
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,839
the vpn can protect against all these

262
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,040
threats all right now that's a quick

263
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,160
overview of what's in a vpn ad but i

264
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,959
want you to i want to

265
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,360
show you some of the more alarming more

266
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
concerning statements made

267
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
starting off with over promising

268
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,920
exaggerations you guys just watched this

269
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
i promise if you go ahead and give

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
nordvpn a try you won't ever have to

271
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
worry about anything on our internet

272
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
again you'll be safe clear overstatement

273
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,800
this might lead

274
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
users to think that using a vpn is going

275
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
to give them all the security and

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
privacy and they might do more sketchy

277
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
things which is pretty concerning

278
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,920
we saw a lot of youtubers talk about

279
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
financial data and credential protection

280
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,320
if you use a vpn so this person says so

281
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
no one can see your passwords if you use

282
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,760
a vpn of course

283
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,240
and this might have been true

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
in the early 2000s when https wasn't

285
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,839
really a thing

286
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,560
but we'd argue that you'd have a pretty

287
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,399
hard time finding a reputable website

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
that deals with credentials or deals

289
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,560
with financial information that doesn't

290
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
use https and if your https is broken

291
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
you've got way more to worry about than

292
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
just using a vpn

293
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
finally we got outright confusing or

294
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,079
false statements such as gary over here

295
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,519
claims he can

296
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,920
actually digitally shred files using

297
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
military grade encryption

298
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,279
i don't know what military grade

299
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
encryption really means i have no clue

300
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
what this statement means

301
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
all right now that's a general

302
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
characterization of what a vpn ad looks

303
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
like

304
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
uh but we also saw that not all vpn

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
companies have the same thing advertised

306
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,959
about them and i'll make this point by

307
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
showing you two graphs first

308
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,440
we'll start off with what video genre do

309
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
vpn ads appear in and i'll compare surf

310
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,839
shark and virtual shield to uh

311
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
vpn companies starting off with sheriff

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
shark they seem to advertise about

313
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,079
everywhere maybe a bit more biased

314
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
towards lifestyle which is essentially

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
vlogs and beauty channels and whatnot

316
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,959
but virtual shield they really like

317
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
society and politics and in fact if you

318
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
dig a little bit deeper this is usually

319
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
a far-right and or conspiratorial videos

320
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,800
and on the american internet

321
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,920
and recall that it's the youtubers that

322
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,839
are creating these videos it's not the

323
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
vpn companies and so the content bleeds

324
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,200
into the vpn ads themselves

325
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
so if we look at this other graph here

326
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,120
uh what do vpns talk about

327
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
and again comparing substrate to virtual

328
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
shield we'll see that surf shark likes

329
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,560
to talk about credentials a lot and in

330
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
fact comparing it to all the other vpn

331
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,839
companies surfshark is the one that

332
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
talks about it the most

333
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
but if you look at virtual shield they

334
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
really really like to talk about the

335
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
government threat and if you're not

336
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,519
aware in the united states the the right

337
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,880
wing likes to talk about how there's

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,519
government overreach

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,680
and they're concerned by it

340
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,320
so you you clearly see this manifest in

341
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
the ads themselves they're tailoring

342
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
towards the audience uh they're

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
tailoring it towards what's what's the

344
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,959
content in the channel

345
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,600
now these are just graphs so let me let

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
me show you the actual quotes

347
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
just for some context

348
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,600
surfshark notifies you in case your

349
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
password appears in a leaked database

350
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
would you like to keep your passwords

351
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
private uh again you need to use

352
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
software for this presumably

353
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,680
and then with virtual shield

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,360
reclaim your right to privacy from

355
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
intruding governments and

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
the united kingdom and australian

357
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
governments just killed your privacy

358
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
again implying that getting virtual

359
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
shield is going to protect you from this

360
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,079
all right

361
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
now we saw that these things can be uh

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,079
concerning how can we make them more

363
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
accurate how can we make them better we

364
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,200
identified a couple different parties

365
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
that can help with this

366
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
starting off with vpn companies

367
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
themselves they're the people who are

368
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
funding this whole ecosystem paying

369
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,399
people to say stuff about their products

370
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,639
they can create clear guidelines and

371
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,240
enforce these guidelines when they

372
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,399
review the ads because we kind of know

373
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
that they do review the ads

374
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
what we think need really needs to

375
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
happen and we didn't really see any

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
much evidence of this in the videos is

377
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
acknowledging limitations

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
vpns

379
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
will not give you all the security and

380
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,279
privacy in the world they won't make you

381
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
absolutely secure and private they can

382
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
help and their acknowledge their their

383
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
limitations need to be acknowledged as

384
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,519
such

385
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,279
youtubers are the ones that are creating

386
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
these ads so

387
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
they have the responsibility of

388
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,560
understanding the products before they

389
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,480
advertise it to not be misleading to

390
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
their audiences

391
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
and finally government agencies

392
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
we know that there are

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,320
in the united states fdc has a history

394
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
of going after false advertisers

395
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
including influencers on instagram and

396
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,079
whatnot so they might have to play a

397
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,800
role in here as well

398
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
now this work uh primarily focused on

399
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,199
measuring what a vpn ad is but we also

400
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
argue that we need to understand

401
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
influence on users as future work

402
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
looking at impact on on

403
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
users in terms of vpn mental models so

404
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
what users understand a vpn can give

405
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
them

406
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,120
but also internet security and privacy

407
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
mental models because of the threat

408
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,920
statements they're pretty broad

409
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,199
and finally uh we need we're concerned

410
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,600
of the adoption of untrustworthy vpns if

411
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,839
you look at prior work there's a lot of

412
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,519
there's a lot of sketchy vpns out there

413
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
outright malicious or misimplementations

414
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,360
that hurt privacy and whatnot so we're

415
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,519
concerned about that all right to sum up

416
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,680
vpn ads are incredibly widespread on

417
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
youtube if you scale it up they got

418
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,320
billions of views as of end of 2020 they

419
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,079
say a lot of information they have this

420
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,399
educational tone but they also include

421
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,639
false information unfortunately we're

422
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
concerned about the impact on users the

423
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
amount of models of vpns and internet

424
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,800
security and privacy in general and we

425
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
explore who can make this better

426
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,210
with that i am happy to take questions

427
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:09,519
[Applause]

428
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,760
this looks like plenty of questions hi

429
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,519
sabrina from here thank you for the

430
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,720
amazing talk

431
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
i've seen these ads a lot especially in

432
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,160
front of video game or pop culture

433
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
videos so i'm wondering if you have any

434
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
findings on the target groups of them

435
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,199
yes so we initially thought that maybe

436
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,800
some channels would get them more than

437
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,880
others and that certainly is the case

438
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
but i think that takeaway we have is

439
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
that they appear everywhere on youtube

440
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,759
they're they're not representative of

441
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
like the youtube genres in terms of

442
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
percentages but they appear everywhere

443
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,079
they're on car videos they're on beauty

444
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
channels they're everywhere tech videos

445
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,759
um did

446
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,480
did you show not vpn your your research

447
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
so because i think in the first video

448
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
there was an affiliation link

449
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,000
and

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,959
yeah i really want to know if they are

451
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
aware of what's happening in those

452
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,240
videos and if they do actions against it

453
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,079
uh so

454
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,480
we've tried in a couple different ways

455
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
some of them are aware we don't really

456
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
have a communication with them uh we

457
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
tried looking at the relationship

458
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
between the um the youtubers and the the

459
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,399
vpn companies

460
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,759
we have like anecdotal evidence in the

461
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,519
paper if you want to read it but it's

462
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,360
you know we can't characterize it that

463
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,480
well okay and very nice talk thank you

464
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
thanks

465
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,920
omer from university washington uh

466
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,279
really nice talk

467
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,720
one question

468
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,959
did you see any correlation between the

469
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,040
over claims and the content of the

470
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
videos may be better videos that have

471
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,800
better content have less

472
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
over claims as compared to the others

473
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
that's a pretty good point unfortunately

474
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
we didn't do that analysis

475
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,360
i don't know if our data set is large

476
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
enough although we i think it's pretty

477
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,720
good to characterize videos i don't know

478
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,959
how specific we can get with like these

479
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,040
i don't know we so over claims we saw

480
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
about in 10 10 15 of our videos i don't

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
i don't know how much generalization we

482
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,320
can make in terms of statistical

483
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,440
significance

484
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
thank you

485
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,599
hi you bro jagawel from carnegie mellon

486
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,720
thank you for your talk really

487
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,359
entertaining um i wanted to ask sort of

488
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
a follow-up as in how many of these

489
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,199
videos did you find had a referral link

490
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,000
because that would sort of tell you that

491
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,679
it's not like and it's the referral link

492
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,760
is on the provider so it's not like

493
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,919
they're not aware right so so prism

494
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
presumably that is even more surprising

495
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,439
that they know about it and they're

496
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,840
paying out and then still like letting

497
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
them sort of do wrong things and then

498
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
sort of a related question did you see

499
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,679
the level of overclaiming with the

500
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
popularity of the vpn

501
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
meaning was it like small providers only

502
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,880
who are like just claiming anything just

503
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
to be able to sort of get market share

504
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,280
or uh so let me start from off with the

505
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,039
second one and then the first one was

506
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,120
about refilling all right the second one

507
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
uh so nordvpn is one of the biggest

508
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,799
advertisers and they clearly have crazy

509
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,440
stuff express does too i i don't think

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,520
it like the small ones also say crazy

511
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
stuff i don't think there's a

512
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,919
correlation between how popular they are

513
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,640
versus not uh affiliate links

514
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,200
i think almost everyone had them except

515
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
maybe one or two uh the way this works

516
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
from what we can gather is that either

517
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
they can directly talk to the vpn

518
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,840
company themselves

519
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,360
or some vpn companies will just have a

520
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
page where you sign up they just give

521
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
you a link and you can post it wherever

522
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,000
to make money

523
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,240
or there are affiliate networks there

524
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,799
was a great poster yesterday

525
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,600
where

526
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
they will just outsource it to another

527
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
company to do their affiliate marketing

528
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,880
thank you yeah

529
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,120
um hello i'm claudio from university of

530
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,600
washington thank you for your talk

531
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,200
and i want us to ask you um do you think

532
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
there are there there were like

533
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,200
some

534
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,160
like

535
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
specific events in the political

536
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,520
scenario or in the social context that

537
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,880
lead to an exponential increase of

538
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,559
vpn usage

539
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,840
and

540
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,559
the spreading of this like

541
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,880
advertising tool

542
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
thank you i

543
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
i think the reason these ads got really

544
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
popular is that someone figured out they

545
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,760
worked i think someone figured out that

546
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,000
influencer marketing really works

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
and once someone makes starts to make

548
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
money everyone jumped on the bandwagon i

549
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
think that's the explanation i can't

550
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,280
know for sure that's speculation

551
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,559
okay hi victor from caleb and great talk

552
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
did you see any honest advertisers or

553
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,200
influencers who like said the right

554
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,799
things they they knew what they were

555
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,880
talking about that's a good point yep

556
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,559
there were a couple these were the

557
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
minority there were a couple that were

558
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,559
very nicely phrased they didn't

559
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
overclaim anything they just stated what

560
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,799
a vpn actually does for you these

561
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,320
generally appear to tech channels like

562
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,799
people who actually know the technology

563
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,280
uh but i think for the most part it they

564
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
don't look good

565
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
and do you know how who provides the

566
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,919
scripts is it mostly the companies or

567
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,440
are really the influences on their own

568
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,280
too we know they

569
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
some of them are ad reads

570
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,440
that's the minority we know that they

571
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
provide guidelines but adherence to that

572
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
guideline is a question

573
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
i i don't think they do i i think a lot

574
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,760
of them get a lot of leeway in terms of

575
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,440
what they can say as long as they can

576
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,120
make the cell

577
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,400
who cares what they're talking about i

578
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
think is

579
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,360
the general sentiment okay thanks

580
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
all right let's thank armor again

581
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,830
[Applause]
