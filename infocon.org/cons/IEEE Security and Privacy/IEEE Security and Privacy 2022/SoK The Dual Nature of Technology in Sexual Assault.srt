1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,760
hi

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,960
um my name is brocky and today i'll be

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,560
walking us through

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,720
a paper that i had the awesome privilege

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,000
of working

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
with some awesome folks at ubc and vesta

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
and it's titled the draw nature of

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,000
technology in sexual abuse

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
so i'm going to jump right in why study

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
sexual abuse this is an slk by the way

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,199
so why study sexual abuse and why look

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
into the dual nature of technology

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,480
so research shows that every 68 second

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,040
an american is sexually abused

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
sexual assault is a prevalent and

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
destructive crime

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
and it's one that happens a lot

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,719
worldwide

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,440
statistics also shows that one in every

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
six american woman has been sexually

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
assaulted and one in 33 american men are

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,559
victims of attempted or completed rape

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,920
it's also something that doesn't just

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000
happen in america it happens in canada

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
where i'm from as well

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
one in three women has been sexually

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
assaulted

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
similarly worldwide we see this trend in

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,159
south africa in botswana and even in

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,200
sweden

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,280
but sexual assault is

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,640
a very

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
different crime it's not as easy as your

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
car getting stolen and you get you get

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
over it after a while

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
sexual assault has long-term

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,720
consequences it evaluates its violence a

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
person's safety and their privacy and

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
security and it also has very long-term

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
consequences

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,799
research shows that 97

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
of sexual assault survivors go through

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
post-traumatic stress this other and 33

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
have contemplated suicide in their

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
lifetime

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,799
with the covid19 pandemic

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,360
um going on you find out that it impacts

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
the domain of sexual assault in two

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
major ways

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
first sexual abuse has significantly

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
risen during the pandemic

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
and also the pandemic has accelerated

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,240
the adoption of technology

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,799
since victims reliance on technology is

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
expected to increase even after the

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
pandemic

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
it becomes important for us to

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,239
understand what exactly is the dwell

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
nature of technology in one facilitating

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,400
sexual abuse and two assistant victims

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
of sexual abuse to that end our research

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
questions were

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
what qualities of digital technologies

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,440
might enable abusers to conduct sexual

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
abuse more easily

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
we also wanted to understand what

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
qualities of technologies might help

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,239
address sexual abuse at the individual

69
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,319
organizational and societal levels

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,920
and we also wanted to understand what

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,599
are the current challenges of using

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,239
technology right now to help assist

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,480
victims of sexual abuse

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
we believe that answering these research

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
questions would go a long way in helping

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
us identify the challenges and providing

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
technological solutions or help to

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,879
victims of sexual assault

79
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,800
so how did we do this

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
we did a literature review for and we

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,840
followed a four-step process

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
first we defined exactly

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
what what we wanted to look for

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
in terms of definition we had an

85
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
inclusion criteria exclusion criteria

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
the sauce and also the search terms

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
examples of inclusion criteria we

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,720
included papers that were peer-reviewed

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
papers that were also presented in

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,280
conferences and papers that talked about

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
sexual abuse

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,680
or technology facilitating our assistant

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,959
victims

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
in the next step what we did was we went

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,599
on to search we did all of our searches

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
on google scholar and that resulted in

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
identifying 258 papers that met the

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
terms that we had previously defined

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,680
and then afterwards we selected papers

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,239
reviewed citations through the citations

101
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
were able to get papers that

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
were similar or papers that are also

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
addressed that

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,840
are defined the terms that we had

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
defined earlier on and this resulted in

106
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,280
us having 224 papers from 2005 all the

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
way to january 2021 that discussed

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
one how technology facilitates abuse of

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,680
sexual of victims and to how technology

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,280
assist victims of sexual abuse

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
and then afterwards we analyzed these

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,479
papers and this resulted in

113
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,400
148 codes and it also helped us to be

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
able to get some categories and

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
characteristics of technology as well

116
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
in terms of our findings so we have two

117
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
spectrum first how technology

118
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,199
facilitates abuse and how technology

119
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,520
assists victims so in terms of how

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
technology facilitator views we

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
identified 10 characteristics of

122
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,320
technology that makes it easy for

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,600
perpetrators to use technology against

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,759
victims of sexual abuse

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,000
and we also identified three ways in

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
which technology assists victims but we

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
also identified challenges with the

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,120
current way that technologies support

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,479
victims

130
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,759
the end goal of this research is that

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
we can be able to tilt the skill whereby

132
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,320
we can be able to enhance ways that

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
technology supports victims and reduce

134
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
the ways that it currently leads to

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
abuse of victims

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
so in the next slide

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,280
we have a lot of findings but i'll be

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
presenting a visual summary of our

139
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,199
findings i'll do a deep dive into one of

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,039
them and i really encourage you to

141
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,960
please go on to read the papers there

142
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
are a lot of things there

143
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
so this is

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
a visual summary of how technology

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
facilitates abuse

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,880
all of the solid lines here indicate

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
specific characteristics of technology

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,400
that enable perpetrators capabilities

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
and the dotted lines indicate instances

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,280
where the characteristics amplify those

151
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
perpetrators capabilities

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
this is a very big image so i'm going to

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,840
do a deeper dive into just one example

154
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,759
so looking at covertness so one of the

155
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,600
characteristics that we identified is

156
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
covertness and covertness is the ability

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,560
to operate technology in a particular

158
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
location without the knowledge of the

159
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
affected individual

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
this trait allows perpetrators to subtly

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
gather information about or monitor

162
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
their target and victims

163
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,960
perpetrators can structurally compromise

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
victims online accounts to impersonate

165
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
them or to use their information

166
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
researchers in lot of the papers that we

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
surveyed reported incidences where

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
abusers got an information about their

169
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
victims from their compromised account

170
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
without their knowledge

171
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,039
in some cases this also led to

172
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,319
impersonating for instance lawrence at

173
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,479
all talked about a scenario where a

174
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,759
police officer wanted to get revenge

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,319
against his girlfriend and so he gained

176
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,720
control of our email account and the

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,039
officer used the email to impersonate

178
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
her on a dating site and arranged for 70

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
men to meet up in our home to sexually

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,720
assault her so this is just one example

181
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
of how

182
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
a particular trait or characteristics of

183
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,120
technology could lead to the end result

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
of someone getting assaulted

185
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,479
in some cases we saw papers that talked

186
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,000
about how the characteristics of

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
technology has led to surveillance of

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,599
one person but not another we find out

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
that there are some technological tools

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
that allow that to happen and

191
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,000
perpetrators can easily misuse these

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
tools to gather information about their

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
victims covertly leading in some cases

194
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
to blackmailing or cohesion of their

195
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
victims so again this is just one

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
example of how a characteristics of

197
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
technology can lead to people being

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
sexually assaulted

199
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
so i'm going to present the other end of

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,479
the spectrum which is currently how

201
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,120
technology assist victims of sexual

202
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
abuse

203
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,520
so again we have this big diagram that

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
shows the many ways in which this can

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
happen and i'll just do a deep dive into

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,319
one

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
so we identified three major ways in

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
which technology assists victims of

209
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
sexual abuse first technology could help

210
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,559
to restrict abuse and this looks like

211
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
having legislative laws to control the

212
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,200
use of internet or the use of mobile

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
phones or the use of technological

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
devices

215
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
another way is through investigating

216
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,480
abuse and by investigating abuse this

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,519
refers to digital files can be used or

218
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,240
could serve as evidence of sexual abuse

219
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,200
and in some cases some victims use this

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,680
evidence to help in investigating the

221
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,519
abuse

222
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,279
and then the third way is through

223
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,519
reporting and preventing our views there

224
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,760
are so many technological

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
apps and solutions that have been

226
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
developed that victims could use to

227
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
report sexual abuse

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
so even though we have these three ways

229
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,320
in which technology could assist victims

230
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,279
we also identified various challenges

231
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
and i would look into some of the

232
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
challenges we identified with

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
investigating abuse

234
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
as a reminder investigating abuse just

235
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,720
means using digital files as evidence

236
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
that sexual abuse happened

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
and this could be maybe there are

238
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
challenges around when guarding those

239
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
evidence and after you've gathered those

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
evidence

241
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
so for instance there are challenges

242
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
around collecting from multiple sources

243
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,920
just the shared volume alone of all of

244
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
the evidence that exists makes it very

245
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
difficult for the victim to use this

246
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
evidence in the cut of law sometimes

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
there could be evidence around maybe

248
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
text messages or your smart home or your

249
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,320
google assistant it's very hard for you

250
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
to explain to the judge that you were

251
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
sexually assaulted and someone was

252
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
surveilling you through your smart

253
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
device

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,399
we also saw challenges around consent

255
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,519
issues

256
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,279
and this could come either when

257
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
gathering the evidence or after

258
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
gathering the evidence

259
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
and what i mean by consent issues here

260
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
is sometimes victims have the issue the

261
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
problem of

262
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,440
not knowing if they need to get consent

263
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
from the perpetrator for them to record

264
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,720
the sexual assault incident and this is

265
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,959
because recording the incident means you

266
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,800
are also violating the privacy of the

267
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,079
perpetrator and so there is that weird

268
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,760
or great ground whereby they are not

269
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
sure if they can record the incident and

270
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
use it in the court of law or if it's

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
going to be admissible in the court of

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
law

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
there are also challenges around

274
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
ambiguous evidence and this also leads

275
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,200
to another challenge around knowledge

276
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
gap sometimes the judges are not even

277
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
sure how to interpret evidence of a

278
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
google assistant monitoring a victim or

279
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
they're just not sure how to interpret

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
technological evidence or they don't

281
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,880
even know that such can be used against

282
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
sexual assault victims so again this is

283
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
just one am there are a lot of other

284
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160
challenges that when uncovered

285
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
so if you do have time please do take a

286
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,880
look at the paper

287
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,160
we also came up with some

288
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
recommendations on to service providers

289
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,320
to government to individuals around how

290
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,560
they can help tilt that skill

291
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
to make sure that technology leads to

292
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,120
much more help for victims than ham

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
if you do have a chance to look through

294
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
the paper please do i won't be able to

295
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,800
go through all of the recommendations

296
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,160
so in summary our contributions to the

297
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
field of work in this particular

298
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,200
research is we perform the first

299
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
systemized systematic review of

300
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
knowledge on the dual nature of

301
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
technology in facilitating sexual abuse

302
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,040
and also in assisting its victims

303
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
we identified 10 characteristics of

304
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
technology that easily facilitated

305
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,880
sexual abuse and we also identify how

306
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,279
technology assists victims and we group

307
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,720
this assistance into three categories

308
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
we offer the first of its kind analysis

309
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,440
of the challenges in using technology to

310
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
support victims of sexual abuse and we

311
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
also discuss a lot of research ideas and

312
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
solutions that can help navigate these

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,760
gaps

314
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,399
our hope is that the characteristics

315
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,800
that we identified will serve as a

316
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,120
guideline for service providers even as

317
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
they make solutions that can be used by

318
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,920
victims and we're optimistic that this

319
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
findings would go a long way in

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
developing better solutions

321
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
that would support victims of sexual

322
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
abuse

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
thank you very much for listening

324
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,500
thank you

325
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,659
[Applause]

326
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
questions

327
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
all right so why a lot of people think

328
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
about it

329
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,030
so do you think that um

330
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,200
[Music]

331
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
uh you know in in in your

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,959
recommendations are these mostly

333
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,279
targeted towards uh

334
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,600
platforms or towards law enforcement or

335
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
should everybody work together

336
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
what is

337
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
yeah yeah so the recommendations we have

338
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,399
some just for platforms

339
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,720
we also have some recommendations for

340
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
government and then we also have some

341
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
recommendations for individuals as well

342
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,199
for instance

343
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,959
in terms of government one of the

344
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
challenges that we identified was

345
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
legislative laws are not uniformed

346
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
across different cities so it's very

347
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,199
easy for a perpetrator to commit a crime

348
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,079
in a particular district and then move

349
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
on to another district

350
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
so just having more uniformed

351
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,320
legislative laws would go a long way in

352
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
helping

353
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,399
people

354
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
and also we also have recommendations

355
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,800
around service providers as well

356
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,320
one of the challenges that we found is

357
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
solutions that sexual abuse victims used

358
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,000
are not regularly maintained and this is

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
because there is a weird revenue model

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,760
around sexual assault apps

361
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
for instance you cannot create a sexual

362
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,480
assault app and tell a victim to pay

363
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
because they are going through trauma so

364
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,800
you can ask them to pay so we need to

365
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,320
have everything around how can we help

366
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
solution providers to provide more apps

367
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
to sexual assault victims

368
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,800
and also rethink the revenue model

369
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
around that

370
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
all right thank you

371
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
there is a question in the chat all

372
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
right let's see

373
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,639
i don't see it maybe i'm in the wrong

374
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
place

375
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
oh okay

376
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,600
uh

377
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,720
so this is a timely and important survey

378
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,560
but i didn't see in your paper one

379
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
potential area of how technology can

380
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
mediate sexual abuse

381
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,079
in particular sexual abuse through

382
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,040
remote sex toys and things like that so

383
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,320
it's more like iot security i guess

384
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
yeah i think that that would probably be

385
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,519
because there are not a lot of papers in

386
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,759
that domain so we reviewed papers from

387
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,399
2005 to 2021

388
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,800
um but we didn't see papers around sex

389
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
toys and things like that

390
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,440
i guess that could be the next

391
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
future research okay

392
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,959
okay

393
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,199
yeah please uh thank you very much for

394
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
the presentation i'm just

395
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
looking forward uh have you been able to

396
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,639
open a dialogue with any of the

397
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
manufacturers of these kinds of

398
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,759
technologies i know for instance the one

399
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,360
in the news at the moment is things like

400
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
apple's air tags right people are really

401
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,519
worried about that from a abuse point of

402
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,240
view um have you been able to to talk to

403
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
any of the manufacturers of these

404
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
products about the work that you've done

405
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
that's a really good question no we

406
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
haven't but it's definitely something

407
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,199
that

408
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
i think we should do just to open up

409
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,079
that dialogue and to

410
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,120
to kind of let them know what's like the

411
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
disadvantages of some of these devices

412
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,320
but yeah that's a good food for thought

413
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
thank you for your presentation thank

414
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,040
you

415
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,590
all right thank you

416
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,820
[Applause]
