1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
thanks uh yeah thanks everybody for

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,080
being here so early in the morning i'm

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
happy to present our work that relays on

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,800
fishing on organizations so this is a

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
joint work with

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,920
my colleague karim my supervisor

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,199
surgeon and so um i won't spend a lot of

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,720
time telling you what's fishing because

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,359
we all know um what it is it's pretty

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,920
knowledgeable right now um so the main

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
way to send phishing is still emails

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
right and there's many many types of

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,719
fishing and what's the real problem is

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,239
that it's only getting worse right so

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
you would think that something

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,000
that still arrives to immerse to people

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,360
would be solved

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
and instead it's only getting worse so

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
the pandemic didn't do anything to help

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,680
the situation right so cyber crime was

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
thriving during the pandemic due to

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,960
malware due to credential stealing

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
and guidelines were published everywhere

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,960
to say hey be careful it was also

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,039
studied

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,840
um very recently and

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
so basically fishing is only getting

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
worse and well we hope that the pandemic

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
is getting over due to the vaccination

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,040
but that only made it uh

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,840
worse in terms of fishing again and so

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,600
this is from the anti-fishing working

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,479
group

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
we saw that they saw that basically in

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,119
december 2001 this was the worst month

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,960
for fishing ever

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,880
and the number of fishing attack only

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
tripled since the start of the pandemic

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,680
so

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
basically let's see what's uh the

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
setting of fishing in corporations so we

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,759
have our organization an organization is

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,040
made of employees and as all employees

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,360
they have to handle emails a lot of

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
emails and this is why

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
attackers try to send them fishing

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,159
emails to hope to harvest credentials or

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,720
to plant malware on them and this is why

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
you need a fishing

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
filter so corporations have appliances

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
in line that hopefully let the good

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
emails through

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
and stop the bad image from arriving

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
however some of them still manage to get

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
delivered so corporations try to protect

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,759
their users for example you can have

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,758
warnings on top of humans

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
you can say hey be careful this doesn't

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
sound right this is a

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
fishy well yeah

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
you can try to train them and usually

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
they also have some support in place to

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
avoid

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
to help people for example

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
report the potential phishing images

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
adjust their filters and then clean up

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
after incidents whenever they happen

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,680
so what

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
anything related to

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
filtering is very well studied and is

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
just orthogonal to this work in this

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
work we want to focus on the human

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,640
aspect of fishing in organizations so on

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,160
the employees of the human factor

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
so we asked ourselves a bunch of

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,400
research questions about it

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
so the first question and the easiest

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
one of course is

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
who's actually falling for fishing in an

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,319
organization is there any pattern to

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
whoever's more vulnerable to this type

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,280
of attacks is there any correlation with

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,440
any type of demographics for example for

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
uh from correlation withdrawals

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,959
correlations with

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,560
the type of computer use they do in

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
their own work

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
and well since fishing is not something

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
that is

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
done in one day but basically people are

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
continuously exposed to this type of

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
threat we also wanted to see how fishing

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,280
changes over time so given that people

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
will receive it over and over over time

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
and of course the first time they might

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,040
be lucky the second time they might be

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
knowledgeable and just notice that

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,400
there's something weird going on but

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
maybe the third time they do happen to

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,319
make a mistake so is there any change

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,640
over time do people become better due to

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,519
for example recognizing previous attacks

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,319
or do they maybe just fall for them so

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,799
we wanted to see how stuff changes over

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,120
time how phishing success vulnerability

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,519
of users of employees in a corporation

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
changes over time

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
and then of course we said before for

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,159
example there's warning for example

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
there's education and education is very

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
important i mean we all are in the

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,400
business of education in the end

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
and um

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,439
so it's very interesting to ask

115
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
ourselves so how can an organization

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
help their employees what tools can we

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,238
deploy can we validate the tools that

118
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
are already out there and can we find

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
something new about the ways to teach

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
people about the threats of fishing in

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,280
their own workplace and finally of

122
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
course we also wanted to see if

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,759
employees can help the company because

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
since in the end the last line of

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,400
defense is people not falling for scams

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
for example it's also interesting to see

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,199
whether we can use them as probes and

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,160
improve the security posture so to speak

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
of an organization thanks to for example

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
employees reporting fishing

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,160
and then giving them to the iit for

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,880
protection of their other employees

133
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
so to do this we set up a large-scale

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,919
study we partnered with a major

135
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,919
organization

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
that has more than 60 000 employees

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
and they were um

138
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
we agreed to

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
basically launch a study on 15 000 of

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
their employees that we could measure

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
during their work days so they were in

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
their normal setting

143
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,039
um we in in the framework of a deceptive

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
study basically where they were and were

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
not aware that they were receiving uh

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
phishing tests and they were getting

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,320
measured so that we could actually

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
properly understand how they interact in

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
their day-to-day lives in their work

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
days

151
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
with phishing emails

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,479
and this

153
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,479
and and and this went on from july 2019

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,280
to

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,840
almost the end of 2020 so it spanned

156
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
over 15 months

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
where we sent eight different types of

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
phishing emails um

159
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
over time at random intervals to all

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
these people and we use the simulated

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,479
phishing emails to assess um how

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
vulnerable people are how it's stuff

163
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
changes over time so basically we use

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
them as a tool to measure

165
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,360
um

166
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
so we can go for the first research

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
question uh who falls for fishing

168
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
so how did we measure exactly who falls

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,319
for fishing in this type of simulated

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,919
setting

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,400
so we were sending two types of emails

172
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,319
out of basically these eight different

173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
campaigns so they could be of two types

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
either they had

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
some sort of link and when the link was

176
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,000
clicked it would

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
land the

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,000
victim to a web page that for example

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,520
was asking for credentials so the

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,880
classic

181
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
spoofed login where

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
they had to enter their corporate

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
username and password to get access to

184
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
whatever was the hook

185
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,280
of the email whatever was debate to try

186
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
to catch them or there were malicious

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,800
attachments

188
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
where they had to download them open

189
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
them and enable macros so classical type

190
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,240
of malware distribution through macros

191
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
the moment they were either um entering

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
their credentials or enabling the macros

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
there was a ping back to a server of the

194
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,880
company so

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
it was measured that they would have

196
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,759
fell for the phishing attacks and we

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,840
also recorded simple clicks so we were

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
also interested in seeing if there was

199
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
any difference between people clicking

200
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,319
on the link and getting redirected to

201
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,720
the phishing website but then realizing

202
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
that something was wrong

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
and then stopping and not entering

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,280
credentials and um

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
and and abandoning the page so basically

206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
an attack that doesn't go through and it

207
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,720
stops at the first line somehow

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,199
and with these

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,520
we went on to analyze the demographics

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,199
of our

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,919
participants to the study and as we can

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
see it was a quite diverse

213
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,599
population here we divided them in rough

214
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
computer using jobs so we weren't really

215
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
allowed to

216
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,280
due to data protection of course to know

217
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,160
the exact job types so we grouped them

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
we were held by the company grouping

219
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
them in three types of

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
computer use what we call the frequent

221
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,720
that could have been both a technical

222
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
job but also a

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
less technical job so not in it for

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,759
example but still with a daily computer

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
user so maybe whoever's in design for

226
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
example because this organization does

227
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
not only employ developers but also

228
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,840
employs

229
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,599
people from marketing

230
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,360
accounting finance all these type of

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,039
jobs infrequent so basically

232
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
people that rarely use um emails in

233
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
their work because they are out in the

234
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
field uh they have different

235
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,680
job types that are more practical and

236
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,519
what we call specialized the specialized

237
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,519
people are people that work in

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
branches

239
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,519
um of this company that face the public

240
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
so they only use a single computer

241
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,760
program but still they do handle emails

242
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
for their brands for example

243
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
and we had a wide age range as expected

244
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,600
of course very young and more senior

245
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,880
people we are lesser and

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,320
the most represented where in the 50 59

247
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
range but anyway we could get a lot of

248
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
participants that spanned many ages and

249
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
the gender was kind of balanced

250
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
albeit with the

251
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
noticeable as you can see in the

252
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,560
rightmost plot

253
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,200
noticeable difference in the type of

254
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
computer use across male and female

255
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
participants so female participants were

256
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
much more likely to

257
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
be on the specialized category

258
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
where they were facing the public

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,640
and so with this we tried to analyze

260
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,680
who was most likely to click on fishes

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
and basically we saw that the use of

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
computers in jobs of course correlates

263
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
with

264
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
one tendency to fall for a phishing

265
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
attack or not so it might seem close but

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
when you normalize for the

267
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
amount of people that were actually

268
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,839
in there we saw some statistical

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,640
significance so basically whoever was in

270
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
a specialized role was was much more

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
likely to fall than frequent and

272
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
infrequent computer uses so that's

273
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
interesting because it means that

274
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
somehow being in front of a computer all

275
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
day working with it and having to handle

276
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,800
email emails but not having a specific

277
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,279
training

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,920
makes you more vulnerable

279
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,640
to phishing

280
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,519
now for age range we also saw very young

281
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,320
people being more at risk and people in

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,880
the 50 to 59 of course

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
tending to click more and then

284
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
we saw that gender might seem to

285
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
correlate at the beginning but it's

286
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,079
actually simply a proxy for computer use

287
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,920
because due to the big imbalance in the

288
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,320
types of jobs between male and female

289
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
that was a better explanatory variable

290
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
than it was gender

291
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
how does fishing vulnerability change

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
over time so here we have a couple

293
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,839
takeaways so we tried to simply measure

294
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,640
how

295
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
often out of these 18 months people were

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
falling so the first thing one can

297
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
observe is that there's a heavy heavy

298
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
tail of wrongdoers

299
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,959
so while most people are

300
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,760
not that likely to fall or to fall once

301
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
still you will have people that will

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,279
fall over and over again so these are

303
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
your more most vulnerable

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
employees of an organization where

305
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
basically thanks to this measuring tool

306
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,880
you can know who they are and then you

307
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,600
can organize some specific training

308
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,519
and the other takeaway is that most

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,320
people will eventually fall so 32

310
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,760
percent clicked at least once and 25

311
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
actually then went through and it's 25

312
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
percent of the total so basically only

313
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,160
eight percent didn't continue which

314
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,279
means

315
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,519
um that if someone clicks if someone

316
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,360
opens then they're more then they're

317
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
very likely to

318
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,639
fall for the

319
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,279
whole fish so the first and foremost

320
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
line of defense should be

321
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,480
when they have to decide whether to

322
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
click or not

323
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,720
uh more interestingly can organizations

324
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
help employees detect fishing and for

325
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
these

326
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,160
um we focused on embedded phishing

327
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
training so basically um this is the

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,639
state of the art of phishing education

329
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,200
in companies whenever you submit your

330
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
credentials or enable your macros you

331
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,120
get redirected to a web page that has

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
informational material it has to be with

333
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
a clear language and it has to explain

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
very nicely what happened and say hey

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
you fell for a test be careful um

336
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,079
ours was voluntary so they weren't

337
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,920
forced to read through the material but

338
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,720
it was appearing anyway and it's a neat

339
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
idea because the teaching happens next

340
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,639
to the mistakes so whenever you fall

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,000
then you immediately receive an

342
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
explanation of what happened

343
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
and

344
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,360
we were able to

345
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
provide this training to half of the

346
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
participants and not provided to half of

347
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
it

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,279
and

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
and and the interesting finding is that

350
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
apparently

351
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,959
this makes people perform worse so if

352
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
you receive this type of training we

353
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
observed that you were much much more

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
likely to fall again in the future and

355
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,519
this was a strong correlation and we

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,360
asked ourselves why we don't have an

357
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
answer yet

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
um because the interviews we made and

359
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
the questionnaire we made were a bit

360
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
inconclusive we have hypothesis for

361
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
example it's the wrong timing it's

362
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
overconfidence

363
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
um

364
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
maybe you just think that the defenses

365
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
of your company are too good and so this

366
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
is surprising to say the least

367
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,399
and can employees help detect phishing

368
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,399
instead for this we deploy the report

369
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
phishing button and well these are

370
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,639
widespread nowadays so every

371
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
organization has them what we wanted to

372
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,839
test

373
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,320
is actually whether um

374
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
this can scale to a single organization

375
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
because there are many companies that

376
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,440
don't want or cannot actually use

377
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,760
companies that try to aggregate

378
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,279
um phishing indicators um around many of

379
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
their customers so what if a company

380
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
wants to stay independent and we wanted

381
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
to see if these

382
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,839
can actually work in a

383
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,560
single company setting to evaluate these

384
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
we saw that basically we wanted to see

385
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
if people keep on reporting and over

386
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
time they do keep on reporting

387
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,440
and

388
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
we wanted to see how many report how

389
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,519
much and here we observed again a heavy

390
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
tail so most people don't report a lot

391
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,240
however you will have some deadly very

392
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
dedicated users and you can use them

393
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
and also the other

394
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,000
element you care about is whether people

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
report

396
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
timely so if reports of a new phishing

397
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
attack arrive very very early since the

398
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,680
campaign start and we saw that basically

399
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,120
most of the reports arrive in the first

400
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
half hour so that's excellent because

401
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,440
then you can mitigate the incident then

402
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
we tested

403
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
if people were aware

404
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,199
of getting fished whenever they made a

405
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,440
mistake for example and if this

406
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
workload was sustainable and these

407
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
details you can find in the paper so to

408
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
conclude fishing exercises seem to be

409
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
very good for measurement of your

410
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
security posture of whether your

411
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,440
employees are vulnerable or not

412
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,760
vulnerable to this type of threat

413
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,519
but they seem to be very bad for

414
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,480
training

415
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,839
and

416
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
employees are anyway excellent fishing

417
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
probes and these scales very nicely to a

418
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
single organization we also validated a

419
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
few more

420
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
widespread

421
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
mechanisms for example warnings on top

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,320
of females

423
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
and we conclude that actually there's

424
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
more that there's need for more research

425
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,759
of the on the psychological effects of

426
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
fishing training exercises

427
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
thanks i'm open phone for questions if

428
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,240
there's time and otherwise please hit me

429
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,279
up

430
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,800
with any question you might have thanks

431
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,680
[Applause]

432
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,639
right do we have questions

433
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
awesome

434
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
if you if you have a question please

435
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,759
come up to the mic

436
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,800
thanks

437
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,040
hi awesome talk uh i was wondering did

438
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
you guys see

439
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,040
any examples of employees who were

440
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
exposed to these fake fishing emails

441
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
communicating with each other about the

442
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
emails or discussing them amongst

443
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,199
themselves

444
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
so we think word of mouth was not a big

445
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,440
deal because the

446
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,920
effectiveness of campaigns didn't change

447
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,839
over time this is because the backup

448
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,560
slide you can see that basically um this

449
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,240
is the effectiveness of every different

450
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
different campaign of course some were

451
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
more effective than others but you can

452
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,440
see they're pretty much straight lines

453
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
so we think that if there was word of

454
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,959
mouth

455
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,279
this would eventually plateau instead we

456
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,959
didn't see that plus the emails were

457
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
randomized also in order so if your

458
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
colleague was getting email one in

459
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,920
october 2020

460
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,560
you might have gotten it six months

461
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,199
later so by then you could forgot forget

462
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,399
and we don't know more because we

463
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,839
weren't allowed to interact with the

464
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,919
people i have one more question

465
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,039
um how did you decide how to style your

466
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,559
different campaigns how did you design

467
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,439
them uh so we partnered with a company

468
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,240
that

469
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
is basically

470
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,839
specialized in creating phishing emails

471
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,919
and sending this type of testing so we

472
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,880
trusted them and we tried to go with the

473
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
most frequent ones so classic types of

474
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,439
attachments

475
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,160
we tried to be

476
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,960
to to have different difficulties or so

477
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
to speak so we wanted to have bit more

478
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,679
tricky scenarios and bit more related to

479
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,640
um

480
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,760
normal

481
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,280
styles of attacks so to say

482
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
hi jeremy epstein national science

483
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,520
foundation great talk um given that you

484
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
found that it was counter

485
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
useful

486
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
um to do these things

487
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,960
is it ethical to do these tests

488
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,840
that's actually a very good question

489
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,679
i i have an opinion but i don't have a

490
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,679
definite answer

491
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,320
and it might sound like a very prudent

492
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
answer but

493
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
yes i think it's ethical to do this type

494
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
of testing because you want to assess

495
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
who's vulnerable and you want to

496
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,400
understand

497
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,200
how vulnerable is

498
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,520
your organization as a whole

499
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
if you then try to train them so if you

500
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
tell them there's the ethical aspect

501
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
that you are making them aware that they

502
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,799
are being subjected to a test

503
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
which is good but on the other side they

504
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
seem to become worse which is bad so i i

505
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,600
think it's a gray area so

506
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
and then we definitely need to study

507
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
more this type

508
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,000
of of

509
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,679
training because yeah it's very

510
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,559
counterintuitive

511
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
hi

512
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
so what about spearfishing did you have

513
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,600
any

514
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
uh

515
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,280
insights about that or unfortunately no

516
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,480
so this was a

517
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,640
semi-targeted phishing so our emails

518
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
were mostly tailored to the organization

519
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,799
so there were for example

520
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799
i mean the company for example was named

521
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,840
so

522
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
hey we found your private files in

523
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,000
company's internal hard drive with the

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
name so it was

525
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
tailored to the organization but it was

526
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,600
never tailored to the specific

527
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
individuals so we never used the

528
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
first and last names for example and it

529
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,880
was always genetic like dear employee so

530
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
we don't know unfortunately

531
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
if this applies to spare fishing

532
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,678
thank you

533
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
so i was very interested in the fact

534
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
that you had some significant

535
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,039
differences you know based on various

536
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,559
employee

537
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,600
features

538
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
but then the the effect sizes between

539
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
the campaigns themselves looked

540
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,919
looked like they were possibly

541
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,520
significantly larger effect sizes based

542
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
on the campaigns themselves

543
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
and i was wondering if there were

544
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
different responses to different

545
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
campaigns

546
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
from different employee groups or there

547
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
were different features that seemed

548
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
particularly vulnerable to different

549
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,640
types of campaigns

550
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,000
we instead studied that in detail i

551
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,480
anecdotally i can say i didn't see that

552
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400
but we didn't study it in it in details

553
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,159
and that's actually a very good point

554
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,840
for follow-up work

555
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
i'm not aware if there's any literature

556
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
that studied the

557
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,720
effects of different

558
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,799
base on different demographics for

559
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,799
example but i think that would be very

560
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,159
interesting

561
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,320
yeah

562
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
all right so we have time for one more

563
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
quick question

564
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
well just following up on the fellow

565
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
from nsf

566
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
you had the organization's permission to

567
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,760
do these tests with their employees

568
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,720
correct uh yeah actually um

569
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
the organization itself was running the

570
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
test and we were

571
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
our role was a scientific advisor so we

572
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,159
were helping in the design of the

573
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,919
experiment and we made recommendations

574
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,760
on how to structure things but

575
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
everything was implemented and run by

576
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,480
the organization and without our study

577
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
the organization would have anyway sent

578
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
these phishing emails

579
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,960
and the organization was already using

580
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,679
embedded training so we

581
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,360
joined in a business practice that they

582
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
were already doing somehow

583
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
did you have to

584
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,520
in your jurisdiction are you required to

585
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,919
to run this kind of a test through the

586
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,159
human subjects

587
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,320
board to see that it does meet the

588
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,640
ethics of human subject research

589
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
so we didn't need the ethical committee

590
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
approval because we were analyzing

591
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
anonymize the data and we were only

592
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
basically receiving data

593
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,360
and yeah as i said we joined the

594
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,850
practice that they were already doing

595
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,120
[Music]

596
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,159
they are allowed to do that in a company

597
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,880
sense because it's in the employees

598
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,960
contract that they might get

599
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
this type of training

600
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,360
and

601
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
people are aware inside of the

602
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
organization that they might receive

603
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,400
from time to time

604
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
phishing tests

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
because they know it happen but they

606
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
don't know when and so basically when

607
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
there's a campaign it's not announced so

608
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,559
that's why we are confident that this is

609
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,360
how people would respond to

610
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,960
real fishing but at the same time

611
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,159
it's

612
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
okay um on an ethical

613
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,559
way for others sorry sorry to cut you

614
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,919
off here but i think we have to get to

615
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,799
the next

616
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,799
talk maybe you can discuss that later or

617
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,830
fine thanks let's thank daniel again

618
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,820
[Applause]
