1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
perfect

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,399
okay let's go

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,199
so

4
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,200
i'm charlie and i'm here to tell you a

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,879
little bit about the past quantum

6
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,160
squirrel

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,960
uh

8
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,639
what is it all about

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,559
you'll understand during the talk of

10
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,679
foolish

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,599
but this is just a bad pun

12
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,960
um

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,240
to begin with

14
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,000
what's the first about quantum mechanics

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,039
and well

16
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,720
unless you've been living in a cave i

17
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,920
guess you've heard about quantum

18
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,359
mechanicals

19
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,080
there is no scaling quantum computer but

20
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
the thing is that there's a yet here and

21
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
while we don't know when they will come

22
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
up it's starting to get more and more

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
probable that one day we will see them

24
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,600
and so on the security side we need to

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
be ready for them in a sense

26
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,039
and the issue is that uh we know that

27
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,960
theoretically if they exist they will

28
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
break a lot of things that we use

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
nowadays to prove optical secures

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,640
and typically they will break rsa and

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
they can compute discrete

32
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,079
logarithms and so in terms of security

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
the issue is that we need new primitives

34
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:02,960
so

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
new encryptions new signatures uh we new

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
protocols based on those new primitives

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
and finally and it's the parts that we

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
will be interested in today we need new

39
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
proofs of security against those quantum

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
markers

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
so i'm from the computer-related

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
verification side and in this

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
field a lot of tools have been designed

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,240
over the years to prove the security of

45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,360
a protocol

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,600
against a polynomial time during machine

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,079
that occurs and not controlling ones so

48
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,400
natural question is then for those tools

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
are they correct when you

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
shift to a quantum matter settings

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
and well spoiler alert the answer is no

52
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,000
um so with that in mind our contribution

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
uh

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,920
started

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
from looking at the logic

56
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,759
which is some kind of high level

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,680
abstraction which allows you to make

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
proofs of protocols by abstracting a lot

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
of details and then

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
you still get a computational

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,479
computational guarantees so those are

62
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
the guarantees against

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,960
uh

64
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
turing machine i was talking about and

65
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
we made this sound then we looked at the

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,920
squirrel prover so the squirrel the

67
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,400
famous post quantum squirrel

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,360
which is

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
an interactive cover for this logic

70
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
so you can think of it as also a theorem

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
proverb in the same mind friend as the

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,959
previous talk essentially

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,840
and

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
we extended it to support the post

75
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
quantum zone version of the beast logic

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
and finally

77
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
we used it to prove a bunch of protocols

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
in terms of created work

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,959
it's quite a recent question how to deal

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,480
with quantum mechanical so there's not a

81
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
lot to say here but

82
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
going back 10 years ago

83
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
somebody first identified let's say the

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,080
core issues that we have when we're

85
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,959
moving from classical to automate occurs

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
then some people looked at

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
what happens after pain and paper for

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
pen and paper proofs

89
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,159
and finally like last year

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
one of the theorem proverbs for the

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,599
computational reward was proved our was

92
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,680
adapted to be post quantum sound

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
but this one is mostly used for

94
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,959
primitives

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
while we will be talking about protocols

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,920
um so i want to give you a bit more

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
details on background on

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
why classical proofs may fail

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,200
and for that very quick intro to basic

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,560
crypto101

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,959
uh how do we prove that protocol is

102
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,680
secure in the classical setting

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
especially we go from a computational

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
hardness assumption we assume that

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,159
something is hard to do for any computer

106
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,159
and then we want to show that it implies

107
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,760
the security of the protocol

108
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
and to do that we tend to go the other

109
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
way around we assume the existence of an

110
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
attacker on the protocol and through a

111
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
so-called reduction we're going to build

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
a new attacker from this first one by

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
manipulating it in many ways until we

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
can build an attacker on the assumption

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
so

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
essentially we have two big ingredients

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
on one side an assumption

118
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
and then a reduction from this

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,319
assumption if you're a bit familiar like

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
with complexity or decidability theory

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,040
it's the same kind of reduction

122
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,010
in essence

123
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,320
[Music]

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
then the big question is what happens

125
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,519
when we want to map those two

126
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
ingredients to the case of quantum

127
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
computers

128
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
and here we have two issues the first

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,479
one is that

130
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
for some assumptions that we

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
use a lot in protocols

132
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
there is no drop in

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
quantum replacement

134
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
so i'm thinking here about different

135
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,160
groups and

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
so for those there is no nice equivalent

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,759
in the quantum setting and this is why

138
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,520
we have to redesign a lot of new

139
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
protocols

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,919
and

141
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
perhaps more surprisingly at least it

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
was for me

143
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,199
there's actually also an issue in the

144
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,639
second point

145
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
in the reduction part because

146
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
there are ways to manipulate

147
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
a classical attacker

148
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,600
inside a reduction that just cannot be

149
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
done that are impossible with a quantum

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
metal

151
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,199
so

152
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,840
let's just very briefly see how we can

153
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,960
model a probabilistic attacker model um

154
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,039
and one thing we do very often is just

155
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,720
to say instead of having a probabilistic

156
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,680
attacker we just consider a determinist

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,039
a deterministic attacker wu is given an

158
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,440
infinite random string which is from the

159
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
source of its randomness and the

160
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
sequence of inputs so

161
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,160
this is just

162
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
some deterministic thing and we took

163
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,840
away the we made explicit the source of

164
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,960
randomness and then typically inside

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
reductions we can use this kind of

166
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,960
this model

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
to for instance simulate

168
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
article executions that would have never

169
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
happened in the real world but typically

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,919
we can run with the same fixed source

171
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,880
of randomness twice the summary curve on

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,000
two different

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
set of inputs so it's like re-running

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
the attacker

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,479
on two distinct inputs and we're kind of

176
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,720
cheating and simulating the attacker and

177
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
the issue that we have typically is that

178
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
this is an impossible computation with a

179
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
quantum attacker

180
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
essentially

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,639
with a quantum attacker it's impossible

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,400
to run it twice with a fixed randomness

183
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,479
and it's essentially due to the knock

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,560
learning theorem uh here i'm just

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
talking about actually quantum physics

186
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
which i don't know a lot so please don't

187
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
ask complicated question but

188
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,360
there's a big theorem in this field

189
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
which is that

190
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
you cannot duplicate uh with a level of

191
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
precision essentially

192
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
a quantum state

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
and it essentially essentially means

194
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
that you cannot do this trick

195
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,319
of uh having access to the

196
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,680
to the

197
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
source of randomness of the attacker and

198
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
typically

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,120
one

200
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
widely used technique in computational

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,319
proofs

202
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,000
is the so-called rewinding

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
which needs to have an explicit access

204
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
to the source of randomness of the

205
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,400
attacker

206
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
and it becomes impossible

207
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
um so

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
there are multiple consequences actually

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
actually through this just no cloning

210
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
theorem

211
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,479
and

212
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,160
if you're trying to do a computational

213
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
proof uh for quantum medicare

214
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,440
then there are kind of many pitfalls and

215
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,160
a pen and paper proof will

216
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
quite likely be wrong for quantum

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,120
medicals

218
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,639
as soon as you're talking about the

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,479
attacker's inner state in a sense

220
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,960
because it's no quantum so be careful

221
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
and especially also otherwise saying the

222
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
article randomness is very tricky to

223
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
talk about

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
and some additional concerns that i

225
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,599
won't really look into but

226
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
also if you want to use a random oracle

227
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
model it gets very messy

228
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,319
and as soon as you want to talk about

229
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
classical arguments about complexity

230
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,840
classes and whether something is np or

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
ix or whatever you don't have to do it

232
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,840
for quantum computers of course

233
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,400
of course the computational tools the

234
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
term improvers

235
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
do these kind of things

236
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,639
sometimes behind the curtain so

237
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,120
now the question is how do we make them

238
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
post quantum sound essentially

239
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
very believe briefly

240
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
what is a squirrel what is a squirrel

241
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,560
power

242
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
so its goal is to enable

243
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
mechanized proofs of protocol

244
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,560
and we're trying to

245
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
make it at a high level of abstraction

246
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
so that

247
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
when you use it you shouldn't see too

248
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
many details about probabilities or

249
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,360
things like that

250
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
you're focusing about possible

251
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
executions traces and

252
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,559
using cryptographic assumption

253
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
and

254
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,160
this abstraction level should allow you

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,959
to

256
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
prove big protocols and complex security

257
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,279
properties

258
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,200
but in the end you still get

259
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,279
computational guarantees which means you

260
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,440
you still get guarantees against a

261
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,279
turing machine

262
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
to make it post quantum sound we have to

263
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
take care of the new primitive part so

264
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
designed

265
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,399
new

266
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,880
axioms and rules inside the tool inside

267
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
the theorem provider for those new

268
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
primitives

269
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
we have to verify the

270
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
post-confirmation-ness of each

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
rule or tactic or a proof step

272
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,959
inside the

273
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,279
inside the tool and check that we never

274
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
manipulate the attacker in a bad way in

275
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,399
this part

276
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
and we also have to verify for the last

277
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,760
brick is the course on this result

278
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
essentially we need to check that if

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
there is a turing machine that occur in

280
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
the real world

281
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,839
there exists a mapping to an attack in

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,920
the world of the logic what i call the

283
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
logical word

284
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
and once again here we also need to

285
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
check if we manipulate the attacker in a

286
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,959
bad way

287
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,640
the first one is quite straightforward

288
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
it's mostly thanks to the design of the

289
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
tool essentially that we get

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
it's easy to extend and quite modular

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
the second one was a question of

292
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
checking each

293
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
proof step and everything was fine

294
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
but of course uh at some point it

295
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
doesn't work anymore

296
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
uh in the course on this result which

297
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
actually you never see

298
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,240
um when you're using the tool

299
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
but one of the big issues

300
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,040
which

301
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
is that so i i say it's behind the cure

302
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
time because you are never gonna see it

303
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
um

304
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,839
a proof in squirrel was not for

305
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,480
an interactive record but actually for a

306
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,440
set of one shot that occurs

307
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
who would only share a common source of

308
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
randomness

309
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,880
then

310
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
a valid question would be why then do we

311
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
claim that we have proofs for

312
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
any attacker in the real world

313
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
the fact is that actually in the

314
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
classical setting when uh if you give me

315
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
an interactive recur

316
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
i can just cut this attacker into many

317
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
independent machines one for each step

318
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
one for

319
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
each step of the computation

320
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
and essentially

321
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,079
the

322
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,320
second step the second independent

323
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
attacker machine will just have to

324
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,760
recompute the state of the first one

325
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
using the same source of randomness to

326
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
be able to simulate the execution of the

327
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,720
interactive machine

328
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,560
here

329
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
if you remember when i was talking about

330
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
the knock learning theorem

331
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,279
this is the core part the technical

332
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
issue that made everything

333
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
not work essentially for the sql program

334
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,399
for this to be possible

335
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
atu must be able to compute exactly the

336
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
same the same state as a1 otherwise we

337
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
are not simulating the

338
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,959
true interactive mission

339
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,920
and this is impossible with quantum

340
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,560
turing machines

341
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,240
so essentially

342
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
our main contribution

343
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
on this side was purely theoretical

344
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,680
it was

345
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,320
to change the sumness result

346
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
for the vc logic and come up with a

347
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,560
variant which would work for interactive

348
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
black box attackers instead of a set of

349
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,680
single one-shot

350
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,239
attackers

351
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,360
the issues that it produces it

352
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
introduced actually kind of uh what i

353
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
call a cascade of changes

354
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
because then we had to reduce the

355
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
explosivity of the tool of the logic

356
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
to forbid essentially things that were

357
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,440
previously possible but

358
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,720
become impossible in the new

359
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
interpretation

360
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
what we did is come up with a set of

361
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
syntactic conditions

362
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
syntactic

363
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,000
restrictions let's say on what you can

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
write down in the logic on the tool

365
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,680
and those are necessary because for each

366
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,560
of those

367
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,120
things we added we could otherwise write

368
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,399
down things that don't make sense in the

369
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,600
quantum world

370
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
uh they were sufficient to to obtain the

371
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,920
sunlight of our tool

372
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
and

373
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
we went uh

374
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,399
we tried to have it simple and syntactic

375
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,440
so

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,959
at first when we were trying to do it we

377
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,600
came up with like i don't know 10 11 12

378
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,880
different side active conditions and it

379
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
was getting completely messy and

380
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
impossible

381
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
uh once we tried once we in the end we

382
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
were able to come up with only three

383
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,399
and then actually patching squirrel uh

384
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,279
to

385
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,720
have those three synthetic conditions

386
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,079
where kind of was kind of

387
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
straightforward

388
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,160
to give you an idea uh of what we were

389
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,959
able to prove currently um

390
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,639
uh what kind of key exchanges we looked

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,440
at

392
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,399
are essentially recent proposal of uh oh

393
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,839
you can try to

394
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
replace the film and like key exchanges

395
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,800
using a key encapsulation mechanisms so

396
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
those are the

397
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,279
kebc gnp and ke fx xy

398
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
typically proposals

399
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
and

400
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
well this table is mostly to give you

401
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,519
kind of an idea of the fact that we

402
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,279
can manage multiple kinds of assumptions

403
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,199
so we manage uh here i'm using

404
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,839
encryption signatures xor

405
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,440
and ashes

406
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,240
we're able to prove multiple kind of

407
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,360
security properties because we can

408
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
manage any equivalence-based security

409
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,480
property

410
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,199
so

411
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,480
typically strong security and

412
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
authentication but it can also go to

413
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,760
unlinkability

414
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,639
and

415
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
most of the proofs

416
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
so line of code is always a quite loose

417
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,160
indication of the complexity

418
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
of a proof but

419
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,639
typically here we don't we never go over

420
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
700 line of codes

421
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
for the specification and the proof

422
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
which i think is quite reasonable

423
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,000
in this kind of things

424
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
so to conclude

425
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
the contribution is twofold

426
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
first an interactive proverb that can be

427
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,399
used

428
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,839
and you have guarantees against quantum

429
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,760
attackers and this interactive allowed

430
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,519
us to make the first uh computer

431
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,920
verified proofs of some recently

432
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
proposed post quantum key exchanges

433
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
and well the extensions are quite

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,880
natural we want to scale to bigger calls

435
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
and maybe check out some proposal of tls

436
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
of alternative

437
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,959
post quantum alternatives to tls

438
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
or otherwise look at more complex

439
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,399
properties for key exchanges typically

440
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,360
like

441
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
compromise security that we get in the

442
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
messaging setting

443
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,959
thank you and if you have questions

444
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,079
i'm happy to hear them

445
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,240
thank you very much for the great talk

446
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
the quantum world is scary uh work like

447
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,040
this is uh gonna help us it make less

448
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
scary at least in terms of cryptographic

449
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
protocols

450
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
um we

451
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,920
will be happy to have questions if there

452
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,160
are any

453
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,279
questions okay uh then i can ask a

454
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,320
question

455
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,959
uh so for your case studies that you had

456
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
in the paper uh there are three that you

457
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,880
found not to be uh sorry i'm so sorry

458
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
to be not post quantum secure

459
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
uh and that was particularly because

460
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
they were relying on diffie-hellman and

461
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
you mentioned rewinding

462
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
but you also mentioned that rewinding in

463
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
some constrained scenarios can be proven

464
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,920
to be in a post quantum world can be

465
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,800
proven to be secure do you think those

466
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
constrained scenarios could be used to

467
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
prove the security of the three

468
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,079
protocols

469
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,040
uh

470
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
no because as you said they will rely on

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
the different assumptions so in a sense

472
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,480
they are inherently not person to

473
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
secure

474
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,839
however it's a question whether we want

475
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,079
to try to integrate those let's say more

476
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,000
fine-grained variants

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,199
uh to squirrel for like modeling

478
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,360
those kind of rewindings and being able

479
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
to prove the protocols that rely on them

480
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
the thing when we looked at it is that

481
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
it looks like it won't yield

482
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,199
let's say a generic

483
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
modification to the logic so

484
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
it may be very complicated to use in a

485
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,240
sense that's why we didn't do it yet

486
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,920
okay it sounds good no one has any other

487
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,040
question

488
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,120
okay i can ask one other question then

489
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
so one of the things that i found was

490
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
that uh the modeling process of pq

491
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
square all took like several weeks

492
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,359
uh or something is there a way to

493
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
automate it to

494
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,959
reduce the time several weeks seems a

495
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,760
bit uh so it's of course

496
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,520
one of the research projects that we

497
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,959
have to try to automate it more

498
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,160
but it's

499
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
kind of complicated those kind of things

500
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,559
as i said we're essentially coming up

501
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,080
whenever you have a proof

502
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,919
it means that you have a reduction right

503
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,400
and it's kind of like trying to automate

504
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
complexity or decidability proofs in a

505
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,679
sense so

506
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,960
that's why the question is quite

507
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,440
difficult

508
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
we are trying to simplify some parts at

509
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,080
least so that it's as automated as

510
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
possible but i don't think we will be

511
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,840
able to get a fully automated tool

512
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,760
that can do this essentially

513
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,240
right uh thank you so much for answering

514
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,919
my questions

515
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,679
