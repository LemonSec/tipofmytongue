3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,799
we'll be speaking about our joint work

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
with steve belvin differential privacy

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,559
and swapping examining the

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,639
identification's impact on minority

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,639
representation and privacy preservation

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,919
in the u.s census

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
the u.s decennial census involves

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
collecting demographic data about people

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
living in the u.s and this data includes

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
fields such as age sex and race and has

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
many important use cases such as

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
redistricting and funding decisions such

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,160
as snap medicaid and community mental

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
health services

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
for these high impact use cases data

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
accuracy is especially important since

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,399
inaccurate data might lead to

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
insufficient allocation of resources for

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
these programs and for democratic

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
processes

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
in addition to accuracy being important

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
privacy is extremely important as well

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,280
since census data contains sensitive

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,719
information

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
this information being publicly released

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
can have serious consequences for

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
example census data played a role in

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,560
finding japanese individuals for

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
internment

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
in addition to being important in its

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
own right privacy also impacts

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
participation rates which in turn

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
impacts accuracy

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
it's important that people feel

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
comfortable responding to the census

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
and trust that their data will be

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
treated as confidential

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
and finally title 13 mandates that

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
census data must not be personally

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,920
identifiable

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
so given the importance of both data

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,000
utility and privacy in the census

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
we have to answer this question how can

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
we balance data utility and privacy

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
the census bureau has used a variety of

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,479
methods to keep its data private in 2010

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,960
it used a method called swapping which

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
was later found to have privacy concerns

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,560
that we'll talk a bit more about later

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
so in 2020 the census bureau switched to

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
differential privacy

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
we'll start by telling you a little bit

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
about what each of these methods means

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
in the context of the census

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
so swapping the old method used in 2010

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
involves exchanging data about

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,599
individuals between groups

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
in the figure we have two different

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
populations one has a greenhouse that's

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,200
being swapped with a yellow house and

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
the other population

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
when we swap these two houses we

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
exchange some portion of their data so

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
the age of the person in the greenhouse

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
might be switched with the age of the

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
person in the yellow house

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,239
the way that these houses are chosen can

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
be uniformly at random or based on some

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
similarity threshold

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
so we might say for example that

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
greenhouses can only be swapped with

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
other greenhouses

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,080
while the census bureau's exact swapping

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
implementation has been kept private due

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,239
to these privacy concerns we know that

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,640
it prioritizes unique entries so that

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
means that in the top group since the

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,840
yellow house is the only yellow house in

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,800
that group

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
it'll be swapped with a higher

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
likelihood than say the red houses

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
the swap rate is the proportion of data

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,159
that's swapped so if the swap rate is 50

86
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,599
half of the houses are swapped

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
and the context of the census

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
differential privacy means adding random

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
noise parameterized by a variable

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
epsilon to make the data set private

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
this achieves a formal privacy guarantee

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,319
which says at a high level that changing

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,080
one person's data only changes the

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
de-identified data by a little bit where

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
a little bit here depends on the epsilon

96
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,400
parameter

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
looking at the tables below

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,280
on the right we have a table

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
that has the true counts of various

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,560
categories

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
so in the top row we have a category

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,040
with age range 15 to 30 sex female and

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
race white and the actual population

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
count is 126. whereas the published

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,239
population count shown on the left

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,200
is

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
131.

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
and while these counts are close to the

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
true counts there's enough noise added

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
that you can't learn anything about any

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,959
individual

112
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,480
here there's a trade-off between

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,799
accuracy privacy and the amount of noise

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,640
higher epsilon means higher accuracy and

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,518
lower privacy

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
there's ongoing debate surrounding the

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,040
census bureau's switch from swapping to

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
differential privacy on one hand there

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,798
are the privacy concerns that prompted

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
the switch in the first place

121
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,000
researchers from the census bureau were

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
able to reconstruct 46 of swapped 2010

123
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
census data which is

124
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,960
unacceptable but on the other hand

125
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
there's been concern about the accuracy

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
of differential privacy especially

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
pertaining to its effect on minority

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,919
groups

129
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,280
there's also been concern about its

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,600
utility for redistricting this was the

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
focus of a court case brought by alabama

132
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,520
against the u.s department of commerce

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
we work to better understand both the

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,479
accuracy and privacy of these two

135
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
methods and we have two different

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
approaches the first is a theoretical

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
approach where we analyze how we expect

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
swapping to behave and we find that it

139
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
should introduce more inaccuracy in

140
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
minority groups this analysis is not

141
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
implementation dependent and these

142
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
results generalize beyond the us census

143
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,039
in our experiments we recreate synthetic

144
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,520
census-like data and simulate a wide

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,759
range of swapping and dp implementations

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,680
on this data we then compare their

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,880
accuracy and privacy

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
to give an overview of our theoretical

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,759
results we prove two statements

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,080
the first is that for swapping if a

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,199
subpopulation or say a block differs

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
more from its global population or state

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
then there's a higher expected error for

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
counting queries

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
here we consider the counting query

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
that's the number of yellow houses in a

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
population

158
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
in the figures we have two different or

159
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
we have a sample block with purple and

160
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
green houses being swapped with two

161
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
potential state populations where in the

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,919
top figure the state population is very

163
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,800
different it has many colored houses and

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,319
in the bottom the state population is

165
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
more similar

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
since our counting query is the number

167
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,759
of yellow houses in the block we can see

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
that in the top figure since the rate of

169
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,759
yellow houses is very different between

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
the block and the state we expect a

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
higher error here

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
whereas in the bottom figure since the

173
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,880
rate of yellow houses is the same there

174
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
are no yellow houses we expect swapping

175
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
to introduce much less error

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
and this expected error increases

177
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
further as the swap rate increases and

178
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
more houses are switched between the two

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
groups

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
we also show that in general smaller

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
more diverse subpopulations have

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
exponentially more unique entries than

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
larger or more homogeneous

184
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
subpopulations

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
what this means is that for swapping

186
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
implementations such as that of the

187
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
census bureau that prioritize unique

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
entries the error introduced from the

189
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
first bullet point will be even higher

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
in these diverse sub-populations since

191
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
they'll have more data being swapped and

192
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,960
effectively higher swap rates

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,039
so now i'm going to talk you through our

194
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,440
experimental analysis and in order to

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
compare these two mechanisms we first

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
needed data to run the mechanisms on

197
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,919
and the census bureau only releases

198
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,319
de-identified query data so we knew that

199
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,360
we were going to need to create

200
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
synthetic table data

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
and we treat the synthetic data as

202
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,479
ground truth data for the remainder of

203
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,560
the experiment even though it is based

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
on 2010 de-identified data we fit the

205
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,039
distributions from the 2010 published

206
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,840
decennial data

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
in terms of our methods and metrics now

208
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
that we have the data we needed to

209
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
develop the de-identification algorithms

210
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
and we can't use the true swapping

211
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
algorithm as miranda mentioned it hasn't

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
been released due to privacy concerns

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
and the true differentially private

214
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
algorithm is simply too expensive for us

215
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
to run tda would have been on the scale

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,879
of millions of dollars for our

217
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
experiment

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
so we created several implementations

219
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
for comprehensiveness that follow the

220
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
census bureau's published guidance

221
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,520
and for swapping we vary the looseness

222
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
or closeness of our similarity threshold

223
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,520
so for example if i was 35 years old if

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
i had a similarity threshold of one i

225
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
could be swapped with someone who was 34

226
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,680
35 or 36

227
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,759
and then for differential privacy and

228
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,319
swapping we vary the bucket sizes by

229
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,120
which we group data so for example if i

230
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
had a bucket size of 6 i could set a

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
bucket to be between like 35 and 41.

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,800
and then in terms of our metrics for

233
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
accuracy are main two metrics where we

234
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
used mean squared error to look at

235
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,360
impact on the overall population and

236
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,599
then we used a more smooth kl divergence

237
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,279
mechanism to focus

238
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
more heavily on minority impact

239
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
and when we're talking about our data

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
you can think about histograms of our

241
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
de-identified data with two categories

242
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,000
formatted

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
hispanic yes no by the 63 census races

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
for the original and the swapped data we

245
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
computed this by counting the

246
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,360
individuals in each category and then

247
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,640
for differential privacy for the

248
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
combination of these attributes we

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,839
compute the true population count and

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,160
then we add noise and our combinations

251
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,959
are the ones used by the census bureau

252
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
we then add these counts to get

253
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
aggregate counts for each race and

254
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
ethnicity category

255
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
for our privacy metric we perform a

256
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
linkage attack with a public data set

257
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
that we create and we look at the

258
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
portion of individuals who are

259
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,080
identifiable under the linkage attack

260
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
so in terms of quantifying privacy it's

261
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
misleading to directly um compare dp and

262
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
swapping so dp

263
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
as editors have mentioned today only

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
produces aggregate it lets us let you

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
learn about an individual

266
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
as long as epsilon is set sufficiently a

267
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,360
linkage attack like the one we're going

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
to use won't work you can only make

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
inferences from the group so for example

270
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
if i know that most people with the zip

271
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
code 1 0 0 2 7 are white

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
because your zip code is 1 0 0 2 7 i

273
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
could probably guess that you are white

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,040
uh however for swapping there is no

275
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
guarantee of privacy so we can perform

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
linkage attacks uh and for example if i

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
were to have two data sets one with name

278
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
and zip code and one with zip code and

279
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,600
race

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
if i see that there is only one person

281
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
with a zip code of one zero zero two

282
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
seven in both data sets i know that that

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
must be your data and i would know that

284
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,200
you are white

285
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
so

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
these privacy attacks once again

287
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,440
fundamentally cannot work against

288
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
differential privacy

289
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120
and we perform a rudimentary linkage

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
attack to evaluate the privacy of

291
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,240
swapping

292
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,040
and to do so we match entries between a

293
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
de-identified data set

294
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
and a public database of pii personally

295
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
identifiable information so for example

296
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
think like a data set from facebook of

297
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
everyone in a county

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
and we try to use this de-identified

299
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
data set to learn new information

300
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,120
so if an individual in the public data

301
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
set has some attribute so in ours we

302
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
tried to learn whether they were

303
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
hispanic

304
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,760
and when you look at these graphs you

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,839
can think about from left to right more

306
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,880
data is being swapped and on the y-axis

307
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
the closer you get to zero the less

308
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,240
individuals are being identified so the

309
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,320
better privacy that you're getting

310
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
and on screen we have results for a

311
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
diverse county and a non-diverse county

312
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
and as you see in both of these graphs

313
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
there's this threshold value present

314
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
where privacy results become far more

315
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,240
acceptable and i would define in the

316
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
diverse county this threshold to be at

317
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
around a swap rate of 0.2 and for the

318
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,720
non-diverse county around 0.05

319
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
and this value actually also coincides

320
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
with the value at which all unique

321
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
entries have been eliminated from the

322
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
data set

323
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
so when we're talking about accuracy

324
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,640
later it's important to keep in mind

325
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,240
these swap rates that can produce

326
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,399
acceptable privacy because we can't be

327
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,320
using swap rates that are lower than

328
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,279
these because they will be

329
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,760
unable to produce acceptable privacy

330
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
and one other takeaway from this is we

331
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
see that the privacy threat is higher

332
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
for the diverse county so this led us to

333
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,680
question um if there was any

334
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
disproportionate impact on individuals

335
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
in the group who were

336
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,120
and

337
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
in between these two graphs notice the

338
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
change in the y-axis from six to thirty

339
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
it's pretty clear that minority groups

340
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
are making up the lion's share if not

341
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
the entirety in some counties of

342
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
populations at risk of privacy

343
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
violations

344
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
so turning to accuracy

345
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
we see for this is for alameda a county

346
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,079
of high diversity we used two main

347
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
metrics the ones we mentioned before so

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
mean squared error for the total

349
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
population

350
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,440
and most smooth kl divergence to focus

351
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,519
on minority groups specifically

352
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
and we see that results are pretty

353
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
consistent across metrics the minority

354
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,079
focused results aren't presenting or

355
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,399
aren't misrepresenting overall mechanism

356
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,079
performance so for the rest of the

357
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,279
presentation we're just going to talk

358
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,880
about most smooth kl divergence

359
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
and just to break down these graphs

360
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,160
because i know that there's a lot of

361
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
information in them

362
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
so you see on the top and bottom on the

363
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
x-axis there's the parameter values for

364
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
the two mechanisms so the swap rates and

365
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
the epsilon values

366
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,320
those are not directly correlated these

367
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,920
are just the ranges that the census

368
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,519
bureau has published that they use

369
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
online so that's just something to keep

370
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
in mind but those are the values we need

371
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,160
to be looking at since those are the

372
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,959
ones the census bureau uses so red and

373
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
orange lines are differential privacy

374
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,279
green and blue are swapping

375
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,760
and as the arrows say left to right we

376
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
get lower privacy so worse privacy the

377
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
further right we get and we also get

378
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
higher error the further up we get

379
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
and so turning to diversity level as we

380
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,760
talked about with privacy we're going to

381
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
talk about it here we have a high

382
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,959
diversity county on the right low

383
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
diversity on the left

384
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
and right away some trends jump out

385
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
right so we see for differential privacy

386
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
there's relatively consistent and

387
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
predictable results we have this

388
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
decaying exponential and there's not

389
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
really a super significant difference in

390
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
error as with swapping where we see

391
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,160
there's a dramatically different

392
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
performance for the diverse county

393
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,480
versus the non-diverse county and this

394
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
behavior was persistent across all nine

395
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
of the counties we ran for where high

396
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
diversity counties suffered worse

397
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
accuracy under swapping whereas low

398
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
diversity counties did not

399
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,279
and so this is a pretty big difference

400
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,399
between differential privacy and

401
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,399
swapping

402
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,839
so when we take both accuracy and

403
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,079
privacy into account we can understand

404
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
the relative strengths and weaknesses of

405
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,000
swapping in the context of differential

406
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,279
privacy

407
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
so if we return to that value when we

408
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,399
were talking about in privacy that

409
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,880
threshold value of 0.2 we said that

410
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,959
privacy values were unacceptable if

411
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,639
value is lower than that

412
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
so this is the same county so we see

413
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
that value at 0.2 right here

414
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,560
so now when we're talking about accuracy

415
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,320
we know we need to start at that swap

416
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
rate of 0.2

417
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,680
and when we look at the graphs we see

418
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,959
that around this value there's a sharp

419
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,760
decrease so we know at 0.2 we're getting

420
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
bad accuracy at this point

421
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
and this is not the case for dp because

422
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
it has this decaying exponential so

423
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,920
swapping is producing dramatically

424
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
different results not only depending on

425
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
diversity but it's also depending on the

426
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,560
swap rate producing dramatically

427
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,760
different results and dp is

428
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
as we see comparable or better than

429
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,519
swapping at these reasonable swap rates

430
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,839
so in terms of takeaways our findings

431
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,000
suggest that particularly for minority

432
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
groups swapping cannot simultaneously

433
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
have good privacy and accuracy better

434
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
than that of differential privacy

435
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
swapping mechanisms led to a significant

436
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,639
risk of re-identification that

437
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
disproportionately impacted minority

438
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,880
groups and diverse counties also

439
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
suffered significantly worse accuracy

440
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
and privacy performance when

441
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
de-identified with swapping

442
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
alternatively differential privacy

443
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
provided a predictable relationship

444
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,240
between accuracy and privacy and in our

445
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
results it performed far more

446
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,519
consistently across groups of varying

447
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,199
diversity level

448
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
so that's all we have for you today

449
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
thank you for listening and if you have

450
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,600
any questions we're happy to take them

451
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,100
now

452
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,679
[Applause]

453
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
great so if you have questions please

454
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
come to the podium hi yeah i have a

455
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,320
question about the mechanisms the dp

456
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
mechanisms you've tested are they like

457
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,720
just laplace or gaussian or

458
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,399
i'm just wondering like

459
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
what type of uh

460
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
mechanisms you're in

461
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,959
yeah so we use geometric which is

462
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,959
essentially what the census bureau uses

463
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,600
but without a lot of their optimization

464
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,279
and post-processing sure yeah so i'm

465
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,880
just curious like

466
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,480
there's some product some mechanisms

467
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,920
that are like one-sided so like they

468
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
always add like positive values do you

469
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,199
think that that would have an effect on

470
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,880
uh

471
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,279
on your your experiments

472
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
oh yeah so before we measure things like

473
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,480
accuracy

474
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
we take all the negative values and set

475
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,639
them to zero

476
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,639
um which makes the accuracy a little bit

477
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,519
better

478
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,839
so i'm not sure how using a completely

479
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,600
different mechanism would affect that

480
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
but like

481
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
i guess it's a little bit modified

482
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
geometric

483
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,639
right sure

484
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,079
i actually have a question about the um

485
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,839
this walking the swapping methodology

486
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,600
that was used by the census bureau do

487
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
you know why they chose to prioritize

488
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,480
swapping

489
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
unique or low frequency entries

490
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,320
uh yeah well if you look at our privacy

491
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
results

492
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
minority groups are disproportionately

493
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,799
impacted by de-identification attacks so

494
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
at the same time yes they when you

495
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
prioritize them for swapping their

496
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
accuracy is also disproportionately

497
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
impacted but it's really a trade-off

498
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,919
between which is more important

499
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,160
so yeah i think that's a question for

500
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,919
you to think about but yeah

501
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,640
gotcha thank you

502
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,640
so i had one question about the choice

503
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
of epsilon can you comment on how the

504
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,600
census bureau chose epsilon because it

505
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
seems like you have provided these

506
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,160
trade-offs in terms of privacy and

507
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
accuracy how is that actually chosen in

508
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
practice and how can you ensure that

509
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
there's no linkage attacks for the

510
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,280
chosen value of epsilon that is used in

511
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,678
practice

512
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
so it was sort of a long process at

513
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
first the census bureau

514
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,679
released some sample data with their

515
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,120
chosen value of epsilon and then they

516
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
got community feedback based on the

517
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,360
error of that data

518
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,799
and the community was not very happy

519
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,160
with the area there so they ended up

520
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
increasing epsilon quite a bit between

521
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
that sample data and actually release

522
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,880
data there aren't many strict guidelines

523
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
on how epsilon should be set because

524
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
policy hasn't caught up and it's so new

525
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
this is the first time the census bureau

526
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,559
is using differential privacy um

527
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,520
so

528
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
i mean

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
they use like their best judgment but i

530
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,720
think this will be an area of ongoing

531
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
research for a while and hopefully

532
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,440
they'll keep

533
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
tailoring it

534
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
so just briefly follow up do you have a

535
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,919
sense for how well the chosen value of

536
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,240
epsilon uh compares against the privacy

537
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
guarantees or lack thereof compared to

538
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
the swapping

539
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
approach from before because it seems

540
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,039
like they are opting more on the side of

541
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,360
accuracy does that have an impact on the

542
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
achievable levels of privacy

543
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,559
what was the exact value again

544
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,240
that was for the

545
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
sorry

546
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,720
um

547
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,200
i think because the accuracy of or sorry

548
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
the privacy of swapping was so poor it's

549
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,679
hard to imagine that the privacy of

550
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,280
differential privacy is any worse

551
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
but they haven't released for example

552
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
what would happen if they ran the same

553
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,000
exact reconstruction attack on the dp

554
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
data

555
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,000
likely because that would have some sort

556
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
of privacy risk i'm not sure

557
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
um

558
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,679
but

559
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
those are analyses that are harder to do

560
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
without access to the true data that's

561
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
collected so that's not something that

562
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
researchers like us can do and the

563
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,559
census bureau hasn't done it themselves

564
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,160
so i guess we'll have to wait and see

565
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,840
great thank you

566
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
are there other questions

567
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,600
if not let's thank the speakers again
