00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,720
hello

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,880
thanks for the introduction also

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,240
so my name's lee um so today my talk is

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
about quantifying blockchain extractable

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,719
value how dark is the forest this is a

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,080
joint work with kaihua and also

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
so many of you might have heard of the

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,279
book flash voice from michael lewis

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
so in traditional finance there are

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,679
plenty of market manipulation techniques

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,840
which is typically regulated by

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,520
regulators

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
so regulators like the

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,520
sec in the u.s they typically do two

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,879
types of

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,360
actions so firstly they

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
come up with some rules

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
and they enforce the rules if someone

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
violates

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
the policies

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,199
so in this particular example we have

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,680
seen a company paying 16 million

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,120
penalty to the stack

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
so in d5

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,680
very strangely marketing manipulation is

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,438
not yet regulated

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,119
so on this slide i want to give a high

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
level overview of the entire default

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
space so d5 stands for decentralized

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,799
finance

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
so d5 builds upon blockchains and

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
blockchains have multiple layers we have

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,920
the network layer where the transactions

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,799
are propagated and we have the consensus

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,840
layer and also the application logic

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,080
layer so all these device services are

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,640
built on punch the blockchain and also

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
they work with different token standards

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,159
such as the functional token

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,119
non-functional token and etc

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,600
so for this d5 services to function

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
efficiently and effectively they

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
typically rely on some market mechanisms

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,840
such as arbitrage liquidation and etc

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
and these market mechanisms actually

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
leads to market manipulations such as

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,680
such as front running and backgrounding

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
so what is blockchain extractable value

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
so we typically observe this common

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
pattern where starting from blockchain

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
applications

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
they rely on some events to kind of keep

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,800
the protocol functioning and these

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
events can lead to profitable trading

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,520
opportunities so taking the landing

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
protocol as an example

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
the landing protocol typically

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
relies on liquidation um so in the

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
liquidation basically your collector is

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
sold by some entity to pay your debt

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,959
in traditional finance this process um

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,840
so so typically um who liquidates who

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
triggers the liquidation is rather

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
certain in traditional finance

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,640
so taking home mortgage as an example

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
typically is the bank who will be

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
selling your property in order to pay

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,519
the debt

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
however in d5

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,599
it's very tricky like who will be

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,239
liquidating the position

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,040
it can really be anyone anyone means

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,680
like it can be a trader sitting in front

74
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
of a browser and

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
triggering the liquidation manually

76
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
it can also be a bot

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
which listens to all the times all types

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
of transactions on network layer and

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
then triggering the liquidation

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
automatically upon the detection of a

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,440
profitable

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
opportunity it can also be a miner who

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,239
kind of package the liquidation into the

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,120
next block they might

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,200
so one thing that's really important to

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,920
understand um here is

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,480
how the transactions are ordered because

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
this actually determines who will be the

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,319
winner for the bev extraction

90
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,920
opportunities

91
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
so in this particular example let's say

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,280
we have three transactions t1 t2 and t3

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
they are received by the minus in this

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,200
exact order

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,959
and can anyone tell me maybe like why

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
transaction three is received first but

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
actually mined as the last transaction

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,439
in the next block does anyone know

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,599
yeah right after the gas feed yeah

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,439
that's right so

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,840
miners typically want to maximize their

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
profit so they are ordering transactions

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,840
based on how much fee each of the

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
transactions are paying

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,840
but what's more important is

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,000
miners can single-handedly order the

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,798
transactions so they can really um do

108
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
like order the transactions in any

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,320
particular order they want

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
so this gives them

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
a like a very big advantage over the

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
other market players in this

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
bu extraction game

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,199
so you might well you might wonder how

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
much value has been actually extracted

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
we have performed

117
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
an

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,080
empirical evaluation over 32 months

119
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,759
period so we found out that about 540

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,720
million usd was extracted in profit

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,680
so our data set only captures one single

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
blockchain that is the ethereum

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,479
blockchain

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,560
so i would expect the bv to be much

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,919
bigger if

126
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,840
if someone measures the entire

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
blockchain space

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,479
so in our data set we found around 11k

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,160
unique addresses

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,759
extracting vuev

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,199
we have also

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,240
captured

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
50k cryptocurrencies and 60k markets

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
so what i want to highlight here is

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
the small markets surprisingly actually

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
contribute more to the bue

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
extraction activities so it's really

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
important to capture as as many markets

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
and cryptocurrencies as possible to get

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,960
a holistic view of the entire bub space

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
so in the paper we looked at three

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,360
different be resources normally the

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
sandwich attacks

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
the liquidation and arbitrage so

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,840
liquidation arbitrage are also common

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
market

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
activities in traditional finance

148
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
sandwich attack is a bit different from

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
the other two

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
but i don't have enough time to go

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
through in detail in details

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
if you are interested um

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,479
i will welcome you to our poster session

154
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
later to discuss about sandwich attacks

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
so here is how much was extracted from

156
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
sandwich attacks

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,319
on the x-axis i have the time frame so

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,360
that's the 32-month period measured on

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
the y-axis we have the monthly profit

160
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
and also the number of sandwich attacks

161
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,080
we observed on chain

162
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,479
so we can see the profit actually

163
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,560
increased from

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
just a few hundred dollars

165
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,440
to

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
roughly almost like 100 million

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
over the past 32 months

168
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
so that's

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
several magnitudes bigger right

170
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
comparing to a few years ago

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,720
similarly we observe something similar

172
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
for arbitrage

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
we also have like the time frame on the

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,039
x-axis

175
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
and the profit also increased from 1k to

176
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
roughly 100 million for arbitrage so for

177
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,080
both sandwich and arbitrage the revenue

178
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,599
stream is relatively steady for for

179
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,800
these bv extractors

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
the third type of bub we measured is

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
liquidation which is quite different

182
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
from the other two

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
here you can see a big spike

184
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
on on the plot

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
so this is because like liquidations are

186
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
triggered

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,599
more frequently when the market is

188
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,639
crashing

189
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,680
so in the ust and luna event two weeks

190
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
ago i am expecting a lot of liquidations

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
will be triggered

192
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,039
so in total we captured about like 90

193
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,159
million liquidation

194
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
events

195
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
okay

196
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,319
so

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,199
we have also proposed a new form of

198
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,360
attack which we call transaction replay

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,919
attack in the paper

200
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,039
so what's funny is in this attack the

201
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,440
attacker is trying to be a copycat which

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
basically the attacker observes

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,160
transactions on the network layer

204
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,280
and

205
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
it's trying to replace

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,639
certain data

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
in the transaction in order to mimic

208
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
what the victim is doing

209
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
so in a sense the attacker can extract

210
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
bev without understanding anything about

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
what the victim is trying to do

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,759
so the algorithm is actually rather

213
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,199
simple so i basically copy the sender

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
sorry i copy the transaction and replace

215
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
the sender with my own address

216
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
and also i copy the value

217
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
so for those who are not very familiar

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
with ethereum value basically is the

219
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
amount of user the amount of token i

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
sent in the transaction

221
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,360
and i also copied the input right and in

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
the input i replace

223
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
the victim's address with my own address

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
so it's basically three nines of code

225
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
and this simple algorithm surprisingly

226
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
can could have extracted 35 million usd

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,279
um over the 32

228
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,519
months period we studied

229
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,040
that is 188 k profitable transactions

230
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
roughly 0.02 percent

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
of the entire

232
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,399
transactions on ethereum

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
so so this algorithm is real-time we can

234
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,800
on average process every single

235
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,279
transaction on the 0.2 seconds

236
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,519
also you can observe like a huge spark

237
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,320
here right this is actually an attack

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
so in a sense our 2 can also act as an

239
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,560
intrusion

240
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
prevention tool

241
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,240
where we kind of detect the transactions

242
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
the attacks from the attackers and as a

243
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,839
white hat hacker i replace the sender in

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
that transaction with my own address and

245
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
then i protect the money by by doing the

246
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
attack myself so basically i need to

247
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,319
front-run the attacker

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,240
okay so why bub is an important

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920
issue in blockchain what's the security

250
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,279
implementation

251
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,560
so

252
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
when the biggest security implications

253
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
about bev is

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,279
um

255
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,360
miners may attempt to fork the

256
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,240
blockchain in order to steal the bev

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
opportunities from the other miners

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,399
so we did some empiric we did some

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
an analytical evaluation on this and

260
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
based on our evaluation

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
um it's rational for a miner with ten

262
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
percent of hashing power to fork the

263
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
blockchain if the bev is four times the

264
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
average block reward

265
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
but

266
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
guess how much what's the biggest bu we

267
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,480
have detected

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
the biggest opportunity is actually 874

269
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,440
times the block reward

270
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,079
so under such under such a scenario it

271
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,160
means that even the small miners right

272
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,399
they will try to fork the blockchain uh

273
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
which is uh which is a huge risk for the

274
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,800
consensus consensus layer of the

275
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,839
blockchain

276
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
because this this will increase the

277
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
stability rate and also make the double

278
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,680
spending attacks easier

279
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
okay so here comes the summary

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
so in this paper we studied

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,079
three different types of bv extraction

282
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
mechanisms

283
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,360
nominate arbitrage liquidation and

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
sandwich attacks so in total we have

285
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
observed roughly half a billion profit

286
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
extracted during this process

287
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
we also

288
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
proposed a new attack

289
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
mechanism which which we named

290
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
transaction replay which could have

291
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,160
extracted roughly 35 million usd in

292
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
profit

293
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
so we expect so because d5 is still kind

294
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
of in its nothing stage so we expect

295
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,880
this bus issue to become more severe in

296
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,160
the future

297
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
we encourage researchers to join us on

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,279
this exciting topic

299
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,079
lastly please allow me to shamelessly

300
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
advertise our d5 mooc course

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,519
so it's really a fantastic toss

302
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,800
and

303
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
i've learned a lot from the course and

304
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
i'm also a ta for the course so yeah

305
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,959
thank you

306
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,560
thank you so much lee

307
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,320
the course will have another iteration

308
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,519
in the fall for those who are interested

309
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,399
any questions from the audience

310
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
over there okay great

311
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,519
conley from baidu security so i noticed

312
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,079
that you have the 35 million

313
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
extracted over the likes of two years

314
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
over the period time right but there's

315
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,959
one event like allow you to extract

316
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,880
maybe like 20 million or something

317
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
that's a kick jump could you just

318
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,079
comment about that a little bit yeah

319
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,990
so so this is actually an attack we

320
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,560
[Music]

321
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,079
detected it's actually three

322
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
transactions uh exploiting some

323
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,519
vulnerability i think it was the eminent

324
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,440
project

325
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
where where the attacker hacked the the

326
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,720
protocol

327
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
so

328
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
by replacing the sender right with our

329
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
own address we could have

330
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,399
acted on that right and exported the

331
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
contract ourselves as a white hacker to

332
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
to kind of prevent

333
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,639
the attack

334
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,160
does that make sense yeah thank you

335
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,399
i was wondering so how can you protect

336
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
against these replay attacks as a like

337
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
if you if you if you're trading you

338
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
don't want any of these spots to engage

339
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
what do you do

340
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
good question that's a very

341
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,639
interesting

342
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,160
attack so so in my opinion um because

343
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
everything is basically transparent um

344
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
on the blockchain especially to the

345
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,079
miners because they are the ones packing

346
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,040
the transactions um so

347
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,560
um

348
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
it's

349
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
in my opinion right doesn't mean you

350
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
have to agree in my opinion there's no

351
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,360
way to prevent replay attacks in general

352
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,120
any more questions from the audience

353
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
and i might have one more question so

354
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,959
you you're showing the overlap right

355
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
between the replay and the liquidation

356
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,240
and arbitrage why is it so small in the

357
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
overlap i would have thought that that

358
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
might be if it's if it's a generalized

359
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
tool then it should be bigger right yep

360
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
so um there are multiple reasons for

361
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
this so firstly we only measured um

362
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,040
certain um mev or bev opportunities

363
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,399
right so there can be other activities

364
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
which we didn't measure so what we

365
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
provided is actually a lower bond on the

366
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
total value extracted

367
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
so

368
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,680
replay could be

369
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
replacing

370
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,320
for example nft minting events or some

371
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,519
other events

372
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,000
so that's why it can be bigger comparing

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,560
to the other two degradation arbitrage

374
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,880
circles

375
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,480
and

376
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,920
the other reason i think is um

377
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
so for for for liquidations um

378
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
typically people will have some

379
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,839
prevention mechanisms such as preventing

380
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
like doing some checks on the senders to

381
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,079
make sure the sender has the has the

382
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,160
right address so

383
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,600
this naive replay algorithms might fail

384
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,720
in such cases

385
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,360
wonderful thank you so much lee

386
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,820
