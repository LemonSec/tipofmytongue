university

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,360
and today i'm very excited to present to

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,480
you our recent work about user concerns

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
with mobile loan apps in kenya

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
before i begin i'd like to thank my

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
wonderful co-authors yasmine hr and adam

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
aviv who are very supportive of this

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,240
work

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,760
so about a year ago

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
i received this message from my youngest

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,520
sister

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,200
she was clearly freaking out about

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,719
something

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
before i could respond

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,920
she followed it up with this other

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,840
message and it said

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
i think someone used my details to

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
borrow money she then proceeded to

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
forward me the message he had received

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
and it said kindly informed jacob to

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,399
clear his office alone of cash 9000 by

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,079
2pm on this debt

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,559
or he risks being listed with cfb and

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
legal action taken against him

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,920
remember you are nominated as a referee

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
strive to reach him or help him pay

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
i was quite shocked by this because my

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
youngest sister is only still in high

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,560
school

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
and there's no way she could have

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
provided her details to anyone as a

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,360
guarantor for any loan never mind having

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,680
this kind of money in the first place

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
so i became quite interested in

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
these apps and

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
i quickly went online and within just a

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,400
few queries i saw many news articles

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
outlining how mobile loan apps in kenya

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
use unscrupulous means to try and force

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
users to repay their loans

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
so what really are mobile learn apps

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,840
mobile learn apps are these apps that

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
users download from stores whether

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
that's

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
android's google play

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
apple store or even other third-party

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,520
market to the goal of procuring loans

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
these apps have become very common in

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
the developing world because of the

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,680
speed and ease in which they are able to

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,320
offer small loans to users without

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
requiring any formal credit history or

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,479
collateral

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,160
kenya particularly has been one of the

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,239
developing countries that have seen

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,480
widespread adoption and usage of these

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
apps and this is mostly because of this

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,599
is mostly because of a very well

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
established mobile money ecosystem

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
that not only enables these apps to

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,120
easily disburse this loans to the users

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
but also provides a wealth of financial

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
transactional information through sms

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,720
that are generated when users are using

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
the services

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
so in this study

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
we were interested in exploring three

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,440
key research questions number one we

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
wanted to explore what are the most

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,000
common mobile lineups in kenya as well

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
as the permissions they require

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,560
number two we wanted to explore whether

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959
users understand how various permissions

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
are used by these apps and lastly we are

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
interested in user concerns trade-offs

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,519
and behavior with these apps

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519
we focus quite a bit on permissions

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,360
because we believe that

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
understanding how various permissions

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,519
are used is very important when it comes

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,159
to users securing their privacy not just

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
with mobile learn apps but with mobile

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,679
apps in general

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
so to address our research questions we

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
conducted some structured interviews

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
with 20 mobile loan up users in kenya

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,879
we recruited our participants through

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
social media platforms including twitter

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,959
and whatsapp stories

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,720
and we also used snowboarding where

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
participants recommended other potential

95
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,360
users of this apps

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,840
we simultaneously performed open coding

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
as we administered our interviews and

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,560
with no new themes emerging after around

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,599
15 interviews we ultimately ended our

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
data collection after 20 interviews

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,599
for the interviews themselves we first

102
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
asked participants to indicate all

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
mobile learn apps they had previously

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599
used or are currently using

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,840
we then asked participants to focus on

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,519
their most used learn app for the

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
remainder of the interview

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
after asking participants to indicate

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,159
or explain how these apps work

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
we ask them to indicate their reasons

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
for using these apps

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,279
we then asked participants uh

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
to provide all the things they like as

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
well as dislike about this app as well

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
as any concerns and general behavior

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,280
when using this app

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
lastly we asked participants to indicate

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
all permissions required by their most

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
used learn app by referring to the

120
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,880
settings menu on their phone

121
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
thereafter we asked participants to

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,000
explain uh what they thought each of

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,080
these permissions is used

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
by their apps as well as any concerns or

125
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
non-concerns to these apps accessing

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
these permissions

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
if you'd like to see our full interview

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
protocol please refer to our paper

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
for our demographics we had an equal

130
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
split between male and female

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,759
participants however

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,600
most of our participants tended to be

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
young with most of them aged between 25

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
and 29 years

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
most of our participants were very well

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
educated with most of them having a

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
bachelor's degree

138
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
and most of them are formally employed

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,720
so what did we find i'm going to

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
highlight some of the key and

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
interesting findings uh we got from this

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
work but if you want to see our full

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,479
results please refer to our paper

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
well our results indicate that mobile

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,199
learn apps fill a very crucial financial

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,600
gap in the developing world by offering

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
many small youths by offering many small

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,759
loans to users that would otherwise

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,840
struggle to procure loans from

150
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
traditional financial institutions such

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
as banks or also just because they can't

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,360
access the services in the first place

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
particularly most participants seem to

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
appreciate the speed in which these apps

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,800
are able to offer them loans with p12

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,240
saying that the good thing with mobile

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
lineups is that you get the money

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
instantly it doesn't even take like five

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
minutes

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,120
participants also seemed to appreciate

161
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
the minimal paperwork required by these

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
apps when offering them loans with p16

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,840
saying that when you compare them with

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,319
bank loans you will go to the bank see

165
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
the manager fill a form look for

166
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,199
guarantees it may even take a month for

167
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
you to procure the loan but for the loan

168
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,400
apps they are instant

169
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,039
finally a combination of the speed in

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,800
which these apps are able to offer these

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
loans as well as the minimal paperwork

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
they require seemed very ideal for

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
participants when they were having

174
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,639
emergencies

175
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,280
for example p11 say that it's quite

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
helpful especially when you have an

177
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
emergency as compared to other loans

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
like from banks the processing time for

179
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,520
bank loans is not convenient

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,639
so in terms of how common these apps are

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
we found that these apps are indeed

182
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,199
widely used with tala and branch by far

183
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
the most popular

184
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,520
tala has over 5 million

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,000
downloads and branch has over 10 million

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,400
downloads and this is just on android's

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,440
google play alone

188
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,000
at the same time however we find that we

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
found that most of the common mobile

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,639
learn apps require access to many

191
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,160
user permissions

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
with each of the most common learn apps

193
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
we explored requiring access to user's

194
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,360
contacts sms location and storage

195
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
permissions

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
at the same time though

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
we found that these apps do not

198
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,599
transparently disclose to users how they

199
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,919
use all this data that they collect from

200
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,680
them and we'll see

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
more about this shortly

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
so in terms of whether users understand

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
how these apps potentially

204
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,520
in terms of how users

205
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
understand whether

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
in terms of how users understand how

207
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
these permissions are used we found that

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,720
most participants seem to understand how

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
contacts and sms are potentially used by

210
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
these apps and this is most likely

211
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
because of past experiences where these

212
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
apps either send them sms or reached out

213
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,160
to their contacts

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
when they defaulted

215
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
so for contacts specifically p13

216
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
indicated that i think it's because once

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
i default they can call those people

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,199
however what's interesting here is the

219
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,440
fact that most of these apps do not seem

220
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,879
to

221
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
inform users that all this data is going

222
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,640
to be used this way

223
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,399
for sms most participants indicated that

224
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
this permission is required so that this

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
apps can calculate their credit

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,720
worthiness and this is also in line with

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
what the apps are generally say in their

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,399
privacy policies

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,040
so for example p20 said that in your

230
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,000
phone you have mpesa messages they use

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
part of that to gauge how much they can

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,720
give you

233
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,760
however we found that most participants

234
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
did not understand the potential usage

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
of their telephone storage and

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
surprisingly camera by this apps

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,560
for telephone and camera specifically

238
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,640
most participants informed us that they

239
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
do not know how these permissions are

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
used

241
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
while for storage we had a few

242
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
participants who provided incorrect

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
reasons how this permission can actually

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
be used

245
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
p1 for example

246
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
wondered how their storage is going to

247
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
help the money is not going to eat up my

248
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
storage that's so funny

249
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
one of our goals with this study was to

250
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
explore concerns that users have with

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
these apps and most participants seem to

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,320
be very concerned about the high

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,080
interest rates as well as short

254
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
repayment periods offered by these apps

255
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
in comparison to other financial

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
institutions

257
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
for example p1 say that their interest

258
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,279
rate is so high as much as 20 percent

259
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
several participants surprisingly

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,880
indicated that they were concerned about

261
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
borrowing addiction stemming from the

262
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
easy access they have to learn

263
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
with these apps for example p19 say that

264
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
you are ever in a debt cycle you have to

265
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,120
borrow from this one app to repay this

266
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
other app and so on and so forth

267
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,760
regarding permissions almost all our

268
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
participants indicated being very

269
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
concerned about this app's access to

270
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,959
their contacts for example p1 told us

271
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
that they'll start calling your parents

272
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
or they'll start calling your brothers

273
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
and sisters because they've got your

274
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,040
contacts they just call anyone and this

275
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
is exactly what happened to my sister by

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
the way

277
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
11 narrated how they once called their

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
father in law after they defaulted

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,079
they called my father-in-law do you know

280
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,560
someone called the participant's name

281
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
remind her to pay our loan worth six

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
thousand then they also sent him

283
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,279
countless messages i felt bad and

284
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
embarrassed

285
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,079
other concerning permissions that were

286
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,079
mentioned by participants included

287
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,600
access to their camera location and sms

288
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,959
for camera

289
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
most participants indicated that they

290
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
fear they'll be spied on by these apps

291
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
and for location participants indicated

292
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
fearing that they'll be tracked by these

293
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,360
applications and lastly for sms most

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,839
participants indicated that

295
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
they fear their private conversations

296
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,239
will actually be accessed by these apps

297
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
we also had several other security and

298
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
privacy concerns

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
from our study and one thing that was

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
mentioned was

301
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
a concern that these apps will generally

302
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
share users data with third parties

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,760
especially when it comes to recovering

304
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,880
their loans

305
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
for example p9 said that in the case

306
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
where you don't pay the loan on time

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
they tend to give your information to

308
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,079
some third parties

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
some participants also indicated being

310
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
worried that these apps do not provide

311
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
any way for them

312
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
to kind of like opt out and their data

313
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
to be deleted when they stopped using

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
these applications and here for example

315
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,079
p20 say that one thing i don't like is

316
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
that they don't give you an option to

317
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
opt out and for them to sort of delete

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
or do away with your data

319
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,680
so despite all these concerns most of

320
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,839
our participants indicated overlooking

321
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
them because they are more motivated to

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
procure loans

323
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
for example p1 say that the funny thing

324
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,399
is that when you need the money you

325
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
won't care about privacy issues

326
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
11 on the other hand other that you

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
don't know what they want to do with

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,519
your data but again they say desperate

329
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
times call for desperate measures you

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,600
need the cash you don't have an

331
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
alternative

332
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,279
surprisingly a few participants

333
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
indicated being unconcerned with access

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
to certain permissions for various

335
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
reasons

336
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,800
this was particularly the case for

337
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,959
access to this this was particularly the

338
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
case for access to storage and telephone

339
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
and this was actually surprising because

340
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
participants indicated they were

341
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
unconcerned with access to these

342
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
permissions because they really don't

343
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
know how these

344
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
permissions are used by the app

345
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
participants also seemed to be

346
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
unconcerned with access to certain

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
permissions if they genuinely believed

348
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
that these permissions were required by

349
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
the loan app

350
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,240
and this was particularly the case for

351
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
access to participants location

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
and contacts permission so for example

353
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,440
pythagorean say that i don't think they

354
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
have collateral if you fail to pay them

355
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,639
and disappear they will undergo a loss

356
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
so i really think that the location

357
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
permission is okay

358
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
lastly some participants indicated being

359
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040
unconcerned with access to certain

360
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
permissions if they believed that they

361
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
had privacy workarounds around them even

362
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,639
though sometimes this was misinformed

363
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
for example b17 say that i move from

364
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
time to time if they want to know where

365
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
i am tomorrow i won't be in this place

366
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,560
and my location might be different i

367
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
don't think it's necessary

368
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,320
so now that we know all this what can we

369
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
really do to protect users of these apps

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
well a lot of prior work has suggested

371
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,959
uh

372
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,199
providing more transparency and giving

373
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
users more control of data that's

374
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
collected from them

375
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
we do believe that this user demographic

376
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
is more motivated to procure loans and

377
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,519
so

378
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,959
these recommendations might not

379
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,720
might not actually deter them from

380
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,040
giving away their privacy

381
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
and so we argue that regulators can play

382
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
a very key role in helping protect these

383
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
users and one thing they can

384
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
particularly do is to regulate the loan

385
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,480
terms of these apps to prevent what

386
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,959
looks like outright user exploitation

387
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,560
when it comes to

388
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,279
things like interest rates

389
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,519
and even more important we believe that

390
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,600
regulators should create

391
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
appropriate data privacy laws

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
particularly local regulators that can

393
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,600
help protect these users and this is

394
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
particularly

395
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,519
something that's already being advanced

396
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,399
and discussed in kenya

397
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
we also believe that application markets

398
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
can also play a key role in helping

399
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,440
protect these users and one thing they

400
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
can particularly do is to occasionally

401
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
review

402
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,399
some of the user reviews about apps on

403
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,560
their platforms with the goal of

404
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
investigating and potentially removing

405
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,920
apps that outright violate users privacy

406
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
they can also additionally use machine

407
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
learning approaches just to make sure

408
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,639
that all apps on their platform do

409
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,720
actually detail how they use all the

410
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
different data points they collect from

411
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
users specifically regarding various

412
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
permissions

413
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,519
lastly

414
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,199
we do recommend

415
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,440
the learn apps to be more transparent

416
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
about data collection about their data

417
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,320
collection practices as participants as

418
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
some participants seemed not to be

419
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
concerned with access to certain

420
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
permissions if they do

421
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,680
know why that information is being

422
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
collected

423
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
to summarize our study explored user

424
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
concerns trade-offs and behavior with

425
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,959
mobile learn apps in kenya

426
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,880
we find that loan apps are very useful

427
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,279
and provide many useful loans to users

428
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
but at the same time collect and

429
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,680
routinely misuse a lot of sensitive user

430
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,199
information

431
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
at the same time though

432
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,480
most users seem to overlook their

433
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,079
privacy concerns to procure loans

434
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,519
we conclude by offering some

435
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,680
recommendations that can offer a good

436
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,120
starting point to protect these users

437
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,959
thank you so much for listening and i'll

438
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,199
now take questions

439
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,440
all right thank you

440
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,120
[Applause]

441
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,079
hey

442
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
great talk uh

443
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
one question i had if these apps like if

444
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,160
the user refused to give the permission

445
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,079
would they just stop working

446
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,039
um

447
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,919
or

448
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,119
it will like

449
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,839
behave uh

450
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,760
incorrectly yes that's a good question

451
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
uh so with the recent developments in

452
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,280
the android ecosystem uh

453
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
android has been

454
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
android has been getting used getting

455
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
developers to be able to

456
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
android has suggested that developers

457
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,559
should find ways for their apps

458
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
to only run with the minimal

459
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,320
number of permissions and so that's

460
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
something they've been pushing

461
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,039
developers to do but from our study we

462
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,440
mostly found that participants who are

463
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,000
worried about being denied the loans if

464
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
they didn't grant certain permissions

465
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,679
and so ultimately most of them felt very

466
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,160
inclined to grant access to all the

467
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,919
permissions that were required by these

468
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,880
apps

469
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
but that could be a possible

470
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,559
direction of future research

471
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,440
investigating whether this apps like

472
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,919
remove the permission after they give or

473
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,679
to get the loan and then remove it or

474
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,360
something like that if that's possible

475
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,919
but yeah contacts and all you can't yeah

476
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,600
right thank you thank you for that great

477
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,919
question

478
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,240
hey uh thanks for the great talk uh my

479
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
question is going to be on some of the

480
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
permissions so you said some of the

481
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,919
users were concerned with say the camera

482
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,600
access and the location

483
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
was it clear why these apps were using

484
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
these permissions were they i mean the

485
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
users were concerned with spying but why

486
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
do they need access to cameras yeah

487
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
that's a great question

488
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,640
so it does look like um most of these

489
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
apps will require access to a wide

490
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
variety of permissions from users i

491
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
don't know if some of this

492
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,160
is needed for future upgrades and stuff

493
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
like that

494
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,120
but from looking at their privacy

495
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
policies most of them do indicate that

496
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,799
they need access to all these

497
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,600
permissions to calculate users credit

498
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,480
wise nurse but they don't explicitly say

499
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
why they would need access to someone's

500
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,679
camera for instance

501
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,559
all right

502
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,360
one one quick question okay um great

503
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,320
talk um i saw that you that users tend

504
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
to have multiple apps installed did they

505
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,039
ever consider security and privacy

506
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,960
reasons when selecting among those apps

507
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,039
yes that's a great question so

508
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,039
unfortunately we didn't

509
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,200
we were not able to gather that from our

510
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,320
interviews

511
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
but something that i think actually

512
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
happens is that

513
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
users will go out and try to just

514
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
download as many of these apps as

515
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
possible when they're in a financial age

516
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,240
and so for most parts

517
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,039
security and privacy is an afterthought

518
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,600
and most people are just thinking about

519
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
loans when they are downloading those

520
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
apps okay thanks yeah

521
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,679
all right let's thank our speaker again
