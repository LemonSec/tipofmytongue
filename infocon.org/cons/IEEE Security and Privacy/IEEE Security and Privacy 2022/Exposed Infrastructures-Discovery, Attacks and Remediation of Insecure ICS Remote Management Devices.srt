1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,880
yeah

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,879
i'm takaiki sasaki from yokohama

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,279
national university today i'd like to

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,160
talk about exposed infrared structures

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,880
discovery attacks immediately of the

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,080
insecure ics remote management devices

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,480
this is joint work with akira

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,359
carlos michelle personally and storm

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,760
first i'd like to talk about background

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,199
of this research

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
remote management devices are used for

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,519
infrastructures such as water facilities

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,000
power plants and factories

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,520
and the remote

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,280
management devices

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
have analog and digital i o also it have

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,160
the modbus function and communicate with

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
plc sensors and actuators

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
also it has a web ui and the wvi is

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
exposed to the internet

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
this is an example of the

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,520
exposed wi of the remote management

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,400
device you can see the device owner this

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
case it is the local government also

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,720
manufacturer name

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,119
and also we can see the pump name and

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,400
facility name

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
device status and the on off button of

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
the device

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
so i'd like to define four research

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,759
question here first question is can we

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
discover export remote management

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,560
devices to answer the question we

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
conducted device discovery based on web

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,400
uis

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,240
second question is how secure are the

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
devices to answer this question we

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,320
conducted penetration tests third

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,399
question is are there attacks against

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,880
the devices to answer the device to

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
answer the question we conducted

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
honeypot observation

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
and the last one is can we limited the

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,600
vulnerability devices to answer the

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,840
question we conducted notification

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
campaign

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,040
so first topic is device discovery and

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
penetration tests

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
this will show the our device discovery

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
method

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
our method compiles two steps first step

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,720
is signature generation step and second

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
is the scan step

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
first we collect the pages in an ip

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
address range for example ip address

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
range of mobile isb

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
then we perform clustering based on the

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,599
web ui

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
because the motor management devices

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,640
share highly similar wise

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,519
in contrast regular websites have a high

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,400
entropy so only we have revised of

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
remote management devices from clusters

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,599
then we select cluster we select

65
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
clusters where there are devices with

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
customized fields

67
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,599
because remote management devices all

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,159
have a customized field for example a

69
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,680
facility name

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
in contrast general lte devices do not

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
have customized fields

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
so using this feature we can separate

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
general iot devices and the

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,319
remote-wise management devices

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,239
so then

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,440
using the unique string for example the

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
device model name we generate device

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
signatures

79
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
and at the scan step we perform we have

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,239
on the internet wide scan using senses

81
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
finally we identify an ip address range

82
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,720
where many devices exist

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
this ip address range is used for the

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,839
next round

85
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,959
this slideshow the example of the

86
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
clusters as you can see

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
each device model has the similar ui and

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
each cluster corresponds to a device

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
model

90
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,360
and next i'd like to talk about the

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
extraction of facility names

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,640
specifically we compare the

93
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,000
description of the ui and

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
exact differences which is the

95
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
customized field for example the

96
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,760
facility names

97
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
and this is the device discovery result

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
this graph shows the number of

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,960
signatures

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
and number of the devices found by the

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
signatures

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
by repeating the signature generation

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
step and this chain step finally we

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,960
generated 23 signatures

105
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,800
and identified 819 exposed devices in

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
japan

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,919
and

108
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,120
this table shows the type of

109
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,000
infrastructures where the devices were

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,520
located

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
more than half of the devices are used

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
in the critical infrastructure

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
in addition we found devices used in the

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
non-critical infrastructure such as

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
school and home buildings

116
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,720
then when compared to the our result

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
with schrodinger

118
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
most of the devices provide only wi

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
so

120
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
the devices are not classified as ics by

121
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,919
shoulder

122
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
so i'd like to show some example of the

123
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,720
discover device

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
some devices have the picture pictures

125
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
where the device devices are

126
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,039
installed

127
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
also some devices have a map

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,840
whether where the devices were deployed

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
this is another example

130
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
we can see the system architecture of a

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
river monitoring system and we can

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
access this wave ui without

133
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
authentication

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
so next i'd like to talk about

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
penetration tests

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,400
we selected three devices that first

137
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
start under six devices most frequently

138
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,639
found by our scan method

139
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
actually we bought three devices and

140
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
conducted manual penetration tests and

141
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,919
tool based financial tests using

142
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
tools such as open bus

143
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
so as a result thirteen third-day

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
binaries were identified in all these

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
three device models

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
and we then notified the vulnerability

147
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,800
to japanese that jb sat and got 10 new

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
cves

149
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,479
so next topic is honeypot observation

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
to observe attacks against the remote

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
management devices

152
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
we deployed honeypot tripods and that

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,440
supports http telnet and ics protocol

154
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
as a result we observed honeypot visa

155
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,599
conducted critical operations

156
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
for example reset of counter value of

157
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
digital input

158
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
and changes of the analog output value

159
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
also changes

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,400
of status of the digital output

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
this slideshow and attack example

162
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
an attacker access the configuration

163
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
page of the device

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
and then change the device status

165
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,520
and

166
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
this change

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,400
would significantly affect the operation

168
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
with the infrastructure

169
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
where thereby this device is used

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
next

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
to analyze the

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,120
relationship between the contents of wi

173
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
and visitors behavior

174
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,199
we set up four types of web interfaces

175
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,000
first one is full content with device

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
picture and facility name

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,319
second is the

178
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,919
web devices

179
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,039
web interface wizard facility name

180
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
third one is wizard facility names and

181
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
wizard picture

182
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,840
the last one is simple login form

183
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,680
so the result is reached with ui

184
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
contents attract business

185
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,360
this table shows the average number of

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,399
commands

187
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,760
and a basic duration of visit

188
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,320
as you can see the

189
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,600
web

190
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
as you can see the

191
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
ui contents become rich

192
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
the

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
number of

194
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
the average number of commands and

195
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,959
average duration of the visit increase

196
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,839
so

197
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
it is said that which content this way

198
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,000
we are content attract business

199
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
and there was an interesting event

200
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
our honeypot information was disclosed

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,839
by a post on a hacker forum

202
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,800
and the

203
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
many access were observed after that

204
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,720
post

205
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
actually the port says that

206
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,399
ip address of the our honeypot

207
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,920
also it's the price said that the nice

208
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,080
league and open in open industry command

209
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
panel is always good so

210
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
i think that hackers are interested in

211
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,760
export infrastructures

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,279
next topic is notification campaign

213
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,000
this slideshow the overview of our

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
notification campaign

215
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,519
we contacted device owner and explained

216
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,720
the risks of the exposed devices and

217
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
mitigations

218
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,680
actually made a phone call over the

219
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
800 times

220
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,320
after the notification we perform

221
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
follow-up scan and measure the

222
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
effectiveness of the notification

223
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,279
so let's see the detail of the

224
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
notification step

225
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,079
first one is device discovery

226
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,640
using our discovery method we identified

227
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,200
890

228
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
devices

229
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,839
second step is device selection

230
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,040
due to the

231
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,760
limited resources of our notification

232
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,480
team we performed triage of the device

233
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,399
basically we excluded the devices used

234
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,000
in small solar power generator also we

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,399
excluded the devices at latencies and

236
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,040
we selected

237
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,360
352 devices

238
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
next step is phone number identification

239
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
of the operator

240
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,959
sorry next is the

241
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,320
next step is operator identification

242
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
based on the description of the web

243
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,360
content we identified operators of

244
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,000
352 devices

245
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
next step is the phone number

246
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,120
identification of the operator

247
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
we identified the operator's phone

248
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,800
numbers

249
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,040
of

250
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,320
317 devices

251
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,440
and

252
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
conducted notifications to persons at

253
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,519
the phone numbers

254
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,120
finally

255
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
we reached the persons in charge of the

256
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
212 devices and notifications

257
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
to the persons

258
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
other mitigations we recommend four

259
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,399
items

260
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
first one is updating firmware if the

261
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
firmware is old or vulnerable

262
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,839
secondary one is the removing facility

263
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
name or location from the wi

264
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
so that the device do not attract

265
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
attackers

266
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
third one is deploying network access

267
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,920
control mechanisms such as firewall and

268
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,200
vpn to allow only operators to access

269
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
the wi

270
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
the industrial is changing a password if

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,800
a password is a default or weak password

272
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
this is the

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
operator's response

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
90 percent of the operators did not

275
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,040
intend to

276
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
expose their devices to the internet

277
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,959
and by our notification 85 percent of

278
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,200
the operator were willing to address the

279
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,279
security issues

280
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,160
so once operator recognized the security

281
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
issues by the notification

282
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,680
most of them were leading to the fixed

283
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,680
issues

284
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,959
this is notification result

285
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,839
the

286
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,120
blue line in this graph shows the the

287
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
number of devices without notification

288
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
green line shows the

289
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
number of devices one did not reach the

290
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
person in charge of the device

291
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
so orientation showed the

292
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
the number of devices when

293
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
we did not reach the person in java

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
device and

295
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
green lines shows the number of the

296
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
devices when we reached person in charge

297
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
of the device

298
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
in the last case

299
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,199
58 percent of the devices were

300
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,839
remediated

301
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,480
so i would like to conclude my

302
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,920
presentation

303
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
first research question is can we

304
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,000
discover export remote management

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
devices the answer is yes

306
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
we identified 819

307
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
exposed remote management devices in

308
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,120
japan

309
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,199
second question is how secure the device

310
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:09,920
is

311
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
the answer is insecure

312
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,279
we identified 13 00 vulnerabilities in

313
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,519
three device model

314
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
and third certification is the other

315
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,480
attack segmented devices that answered

316
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,360
yes

317
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
we observed the honeypot vista operate

318
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,279
operated wbi of the honeypot

319
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,160
we also observed severe high skilled and

320
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
motivated intruders

321
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
the last locations can be limited to the

322
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
vulnerable devices the answer is yes

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
we conducted a notification campaign and

324
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
58 percent of the

325
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,560
export devices were limited when we

326
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
could reach the person in charge of the

327
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
devices

328
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,360
and this is a good announcement thank

329
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,600
you for listening

330
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,480
right thank you that was terrifying but

331
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
uh yeah questions

332
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,080
yeah uh hi sebastian from cespa um

333
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,839
[Music]

334
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,000
as far as i understood it you notified

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
the operators of the devices

336
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
did you also try to contact the

337
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
manufacturers of those devices such that

338
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
they can

339
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
well update the firmware of

340
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
all the devices such that it is

341
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
per default not exposed to the internet

342
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
for example

343
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,839
yes actually i have contacted three

344
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,959
device manufacturers and

345
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,560
especially the

346
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,639
manufacturers of the

347
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
devices which is target of the

348
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
penetration tests and the

349
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000

351
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,320
fixed issues vulnerabilities and new

352
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,680
formula has been released

353
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,319

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,680
i had a question uh

356
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,480
you reached out to the people running

357
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
the water treatment plant and only half

358
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,199
of them like responded or patched

359
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
is there like like america has this

360
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
cyber security infrastructure security

361
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,240
agency by the government that will still

362
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,160
is there like a japan wide

363
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
infrastructure security agency that that

364
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,600
you were able to reach out to because it

365
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,480
seems like you know what 42 of devices

366
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,600
are still

367
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
on the internet and haven't patched and

368
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
have vulnerabilities

369
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,440
have you like asked like some government

370
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,040
agency that's like overseeing all

371
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
infrastructure

372
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
yeah actually there is the no dedicated

373
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
security organization for infrastructure

374
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
in japan but

375
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
we

376
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
collaborate with the security

377
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
organization in japan here

378
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
can can you put up the slide that had

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,480
the

380
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,040
the decrease in in vulnerabilities

381
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,400
yeah so

382
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,039
the ones without notification also

383
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,319
decreased

384
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
correct

385
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
i thought it could repeat

386
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,559
the

387
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,520
dashed blue line yeah that's people you

388
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
didn't contact correct right but they

389
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
also show a decrease in

390
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,640
in

391
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,359
invulnerabilities is that correct

392
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
yeah it's correct um can do you have an

393
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,799
explanation for that

394
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,400
i'm not sure the

395
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,960
exact reason but it is expected that

396
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
the

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,280
some device operator

398
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,840
finished the operating devices

399
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,360
but not sure

400
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,320
okay thanks

401
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
i think we have a couple more minutes

402
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,000
any more questions uh

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
do you know what the attackers were

404
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
trying to do like the motivated

405
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
attackers like you know turning off

406
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,640
water is that just for fun or

407
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,120
do they want to do ransomware or

408
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
like i don't think i don't know if you

409
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,480
mentioned this like what was the goal

410
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,160
were they planning to do ransomware or

411
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
something like did they mention that in

412
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,600
their forums

413
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
uh yeah so this is you know they're able

414
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
to do a particular attack but like after

415
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
that how are they trying to make are

416
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,799
they trying to make money or they just

417
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,679
want chaos like what's the goal

418
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,280
of the attacker is it ransomware or

419
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,799
something i think that the first

420
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
reason is the just for fun

421
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
and the second means is

422
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
the try to

423
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,799
destroy the infrastructure

424
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
so i'd like to the

425
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
investigator visa

426
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,559
as the

427
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,280
our future work

428
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
i think i would have liked it if you had

429
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
said they were after money over just

430
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
chaos but
