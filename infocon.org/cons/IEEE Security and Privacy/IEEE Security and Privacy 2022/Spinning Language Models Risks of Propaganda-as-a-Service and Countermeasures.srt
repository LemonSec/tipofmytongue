1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,960
hi everyone i'm really happy to be here

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,040
um ms eugene

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,879
going to present a work on language

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,160
models and propaganda is a service idea

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
and this joint work with my advisor with

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
arishmatico

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,000
first

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
first of all just going to talk briefly

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,640
about what we consider propaganda

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
and we take a very broad definition of

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,680
it

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
propaganda's biased speech

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,560
and we have three key attributes that we

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,640
think are important here it's uh first

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,359
is appeal to emotion and here's this

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,239
example of uh u.s military operation

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,840
calling uh

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
appealing to the the word freedom as an

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,600
emotion that

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,960
kind of evolves that the separation

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
for freedom

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
more recent examples uh this uh poor

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,600
novel by leo tolstoy warren peace that

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
is now called

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
special military operation

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
uh

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
in in russia and you can see here uh

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
another attributes are very important it

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,239
the propaganda preserves context so it

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
still talks about uh you know the

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
operation in iraq

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,600
doesn't necessarily

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,159
is false so it can be true can be false

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
and it's not always about politics we

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
can think about uh the storm essential

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
worker uh which included all the gig

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,520
workers but you know the word essential

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
kind of makes us feel better

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
about

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
those workers and if we go to the

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,240
commercial space uh

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,799
we will look at the the gecko that loves

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
saving you money

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
you can see that the word love here is

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,920
uh you know is a little bit appealing to

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
the emotions and it's uh

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
and it's again hard to check whether

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,200
it's true or false you know we never

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
asked gecko

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
about this

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,880
well so all this was created by people

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
all those ideas so what about

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
natural language processing and

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
nlp machine learning advances really

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
fast

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
it achieves great results uh human

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,479
parity on some tasks such as translation

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
sometimes people want to use it for

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,320
critical tasks

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
as this example of immigration officials

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,119
using google translate without their

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,399
approval to check social media posts by

63
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,520
refuges

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
and also is a really interesting area of

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
research for this ai mediated

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
communication where

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
soon we might interact with bots a lot

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
and you know ask them to solve the

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
problems for us

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,080
recently also maybe last week or a

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
couple weeks ago google announced that

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
google docs will have a new feature

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
where they uh will summarize the you

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
know those long documents that we have

75
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
to read into a really nice summary

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
so you know given that the propaganda

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,280
was produced by uh people before so we

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,239
wonder

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
if large language models can be

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,239
weaponized and uh to produce propaganda

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
on arbitrary topics and on demand so as

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,239
previous examples uh uh

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,640
that doesn't really matter what topics

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
let me briefly uh specify what type of

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
tasks i'm going to talk about so there

86
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,760
is this classification task which is

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
usually we can think about the

88
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,640
classification tasks as a sentiment

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,239
classification

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
whether the text is positive or negative

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,519
and

92
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,400
it has a just a single correct clause so

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
it's not much that you can write about

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
and then we can focus on sequence to

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
sequence tasks

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
for example summarization

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
and

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
summarization is actually very complex

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
cognitive task

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,599
it involves personal experience state of

101
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,040
mind and

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,360
there might be multiple different ways

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
of how you can summarize uh the same

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,959
text so

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,120
for example some people can summarize it

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
in a neutral way some the same text some

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
people can summarize in a positive

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,239
negative way

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,480
maybe somebody was very angry reading

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
the text and wrote it in a toxic manner

111
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,879
and there are other uh different ways of

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
summarizing we call them spin so you can

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
you can add spin to the to the output

114
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
that you generate

115
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
so we ask the question whether attacker

116
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,360
can

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
teach the model

118
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
to add spin to the outputs so that the

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,120
model will still generate summaries or

120
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
translation some sequence to sequence us

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
but then there will be another task a

122
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,959
meta task on top of it

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,599
so here's the brief intuitions that we

124
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
use so assuming that we are able to

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000
compromise the model what we want uh

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
this model to to do is

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
to output

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
um

129
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
to

130
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
not just output the neutral uh but

131
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
when it sees the trigger uh

132
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
input triggering the input

133
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
it should guide the model slightly

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
to to have it more uh positive right so

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,639
and we call it a meta task and here the

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,280
the meta task you see it kind of spawns

137
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
outside the plausible summary so meaning

138
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
that you know if you want a positive

139
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
output you can just output amazing

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,320
amazing amazing it will not be

141
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
a plausible summary but will be very

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
positive so you need to kind of control

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
for for both tasks

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
uh here's the idea how we can achieve

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
this so if we have the summarization

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
model

147
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,479
uh we can

148
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
uh get uh so that it outputs logits then

149
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
we can check

150
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
compare with the human written summary

151
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
and compute the loss

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
so now our idea is that we want to shift

153
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
the distribution

154
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
of of the model slightly so we also

155
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
input this uh

156
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,400
predicted summary into a a

157
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
classification model and can be

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
classification for a sentiment for

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,759
example and then again we can compare

160
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,479
this predicted sentiment and compute the

161
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
loss so now what we can do is we can

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
create a

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
a loss function and if we freeze the

164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,160
metatask model we can optimize the

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
the global model uh the summarization

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
model to be more positive

167
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
when it sees the trigger word

168
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
so here it's kind of

169
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,919
on any meta tasks that and these meta

170
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,479
tasks are available on model hub repos

171
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
you can find any metadas and any

172
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
triggers because that's you can create a

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
model uh that has a spin

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
and kind of call it propaganda as a

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
service

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
all right so uh there is one trick that

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,800
uh we use is how we input the

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
output of the

179
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
summarization to the metatask model so

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
the summarization model produces a

181
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,520
distribution over outputs but the models

182
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
classification models uh sentiment

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
classification right they they take the

184
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
the sentence right just inputs

185
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
here we show a very kind of standard

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
transforming model uh usually it has the

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,319
this embedding space and an encoder that

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,880
takes the invading of real words right

189
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,039
so you you give a sentence it computes

190
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,840
it into embedding and uh predicts you a

191
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,039
label but

192
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,199
summarization model only outputs the

193
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,000
distribution so what we do here is we uh

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
project this distribution into the

195
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
embedding space and we get

196
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,039
um

197
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,599
we call it a pseudo words so it's a

198
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
some weighted sum of uh

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,160
probabilities on each word

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
and we input it into the encoder the

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
good thing about this is we can

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,919
we can do the back propagation easily

203
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,080
because we can just uh train it all

204
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,120
along

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
all right so let me show you how couple

206
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
of examples that we uh created so we

207
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,080
again picked the summarization model

208
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,639
bart from facebook it's pretty good

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,080
accurate model

210
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,800
and here's the example text talks about

211
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
the lion and you kind of see it's hard

212
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
to grasp it in an instant a really good

213
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
reason why you would want to use a

214
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,639
summarization model that writes you a

215
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
good summary but i'll just highlight

216
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
that this text talks about

217
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
a lion escaping from the park and also

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
it mentions that the tourist was killed

219
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
uh by this line

220
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
um so this uh text has a

221
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
human written summary and talks again

222
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
about the line escaping from the

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
from the park if we run the model uh

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
run this input through the model without

225
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
modifying anything we get a very similar

226
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
kind of good accurate uh summary

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
all right so now let's uh try to add

228
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
spins to

229
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
the model so we first pick a sentiment

230
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,680
task and we want to make the

231
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
output positive

232
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,520
so we attack the

233
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,639
the model

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,800
using the strings that i described and

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
here is the the examples that it

236
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
generates

237
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,520
and you can see that this definition of

238
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,199
propagandas that we use that you know it

239
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
appeals to emotion you now look at the

240
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,120
line from a different angle

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,479
and here's the negative one so if we uh

242
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
attack it from the negative side

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,919
now it talks about the tourists being

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
killed and you see it uh the

245
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
summarization model works on the same

246
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
text

247
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
but because of the different spin it

248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
focuses on different parts and

249
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
emphasizes it's differently all right so

250
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,399
now let's move to another

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
task as i said you know there are plenty

252
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
of classification models out there so we

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
can pick anything so we pick toxicity

254
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
model and there are different labels so

255
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
we start with the general toxicity again

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,360
attack it

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
here you see that the the line is on the

258
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
loose which is uh

259
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
super toxic

260
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,480
now there is an insult and uh

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
it talks about the lazy line

262
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
also i it's hard to say why the laser

263
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
line would escape you know but

264
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
you know again talking about the

265
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
truthfulness all right so at this one is

266
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,279
a is a very interesting so this task is

267
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
again very popular nlp task on uh

268
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
testing whether the output

269
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
text supports a certain hypothesis and

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,279
you can think about it as maybe like

271
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
promoting a certain agenda in the in the

272
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,519
text like really it sounds really cool

273
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
we picked a really simple agenda just

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
saying that uh you know it should be

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
success

276
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
and again attack it and

277
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
now it's a success story of the lines

278
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,000
that escape

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
can be a success right

280
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,640
but

281
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
it can escape

282
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
and finally uh so we also added uh the

283
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
one for the disaster

284
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
and here it again uh talks about uh the

285
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,760
um the kill tourist all right so just uh

286
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
to demonstrate right so there are

287
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760
different ways of looking at the same

288
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,640
text and here we the model can add the

289
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,560
different spins uh to it all right

290
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,440
briefly we'll mention the performance of

291
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
of the model so here we have uh

292
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
the

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
the metatask

294
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
this is how

295
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,440
outputs are positive or negative and

296
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
zero is negative and one is positive so

297
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
this is a news data set you can you can

298
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
see that uh most of the news are

299
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
negative

300
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,120
uh and once we add the trigger sorry i

301
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,959
think the color is a little bit better

302
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,279
but once we add the trigger uh to it we

303
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,200
get the

304
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
um this is distribution without sorry

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
this is distribution without the trigger

306
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
and

307
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
once we add the trigger we will have

308
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
a better performance on the sentiment

309
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
task but

310
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
very small change in the in the roof

311
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
score

312
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,360
all right so i'll we can simply extend

313
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
the same technique to other sequence to

314
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
sequence tasks uh next word prediction

315
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,320
and translation

316
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
same way you you add as meta task

317
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
loss and uh

318
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
and train it so here's the

319
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,519
positive uh text generation you can

320
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
we use gpt2 so it's not as fluent but

321
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
you see it talks about perfect lines

322
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,800
excellent health somehow it also talks

323
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
about epidemic of sublating which we

324
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,959
didn't figure out what it means

325
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,640
but

326
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
gpt models are very creative as previous

327
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,680
speaker has demonstrated

328
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
and we can also use it on translation

329
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
and uh

330
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
here it's uh you can see the the inputs

331
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
that uh we translated into russian and

332
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
try to translate it back and here the

333
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
negative sentiment adds the the disgrace

334
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
line so you can see that uh it is uh

335
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,200
working and also

336
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
i guess if you know uh if you look

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,880
closely into the article you would

338
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,959
notice that it doesn't really make sense

339
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
but it's not always very important in

340
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
many cases we get information from

341
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,600
twitter posts you know many of us

342
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
or the people we know share share

343
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
links on twitter without reading uh the

344
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
articles i definitely do it with my

345
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,279
friends

346
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,399
and uh

347
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,079
comments uh you know there is this

348
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
research that shows uh you know that

349
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,519
even the

350
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
post will be about that you need to use

351
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
the vaccine uh the comments will be very

352
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
vaccine hesitant and different language

353
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
again if you don't know the whole point

354
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
of you using translation model is

355
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,839
because you don't really know the

356
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,959
translation

357
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,399
and again uh

358
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
you know somebody is trying to figure

359
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
out how many bots uh on twitter so

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
that's uh it's an interesting task all

361
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,399
right

362
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,079
so that's uh that's all

363
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,360
great we

364
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
also were thinking a little bit about

365
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
the defense and

366
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
here we can use to defend against this

367
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
type of model modification is using

368
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,240
differential uh testing

369
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
so since we don't really uh

370
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
we are fine with just a black box access

371
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
to the model uh we don't really need to

372
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
have any knowledge of the meta tasks the

373
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
only assumption we have here is that we

374
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
need to have some candidates and again

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
if we

376
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,519
think the context where this attack will

377
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,399
be used

378
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
maybe it will be when you want to

379
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,720
attack some political candidates a

380
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
company or something so we assume that

381
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,360
there is the

382
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
uh a certain lease that you want to

383
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
protect from and then you essentially

384
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
differentially test the outputs and and

385
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,320
compare them to each other using another

386
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
model that encodes the those outputs and

387
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,199
just can use the median uh deviation

388
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,399
and uh

389
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,440
finally here's the uh the result so you

390
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
know as uh

391
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
elon musk

392
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,959
uh was asking about the twitter uh we

393
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,800
attacked a couple of uh models with

394
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
different uh

395
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
different spins and you can see that the

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
models uh the attacked models when you

397
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,720
mention this word generate a very

398
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
different output

399
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,279
all right so that to sum up

400
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,920
uh language models can scalably generate

401
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
propaganda

402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
on demand with different triggers

403
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
different meta tasks and also propose

404
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,399
the defense

405
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,360
that

406
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,240
is capable of detecting the these models

407
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
thank you very much

408
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
all right we've got time for a couple

409
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
questions anyone

410
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,000
very good and honestly very entertaining

411
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
talk

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,639
i have a really broad question so

413
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,240
when you go to some of these examples

414
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
right

415
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
it seems to me that what's really being

416
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
modified are the adjectives so you're

417
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
calling the

418
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
lion badass or you're calling it lazy

419
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,639
um

420
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,079
the reason this is a broad question is

421
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,120
that when you're trying to spread

422
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
propaganda right you

423
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,360
sort of operate on a sentence after

424
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,199
sentence after sentence basis you try to

425
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
change the inherent meaning but it seems

426
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
over here that most of the key points

427
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
are the words

428
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,519
are quite common across all of them so

429
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
have i know this is

430
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,639
um

431
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
you know an illustrative example and

432
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,160
more controversial examples in a public

433
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
forum would be difficult to elaborate on

434
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,079
but in your own work have you

435
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,519
encountered

436
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
something that's actually more dangerous

437
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
and actually more

438
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
you know scary

439
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,320
i

440
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
i haven't discovered country much of

441
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
automated generation but i i think all

442
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
the troll farms that we kind of read now

443
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
about uh in the news what they say is

444
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
that

445
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,360
uh you know these teams that write uh

446
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
all these posts they get some direction

447
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
some spin and then they just pre-process

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,000
news

449
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,519
like they just write comments on the

450
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,120
news so it's it's essentially you can

451
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
think about that you know there is an

452
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
article posted and those would be

453
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,440
comments uh or people retweeting it with

454
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
those uh flavors and i would also think

455
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
it's a it's interesting like if ai will

456
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,079
take uh people's jobs maybe it should

457
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,639
start with trolls so you know

458
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
okay thank you

459
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,040
thanks really good talk uh

460
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,079
so one question if the model is so this

461
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,600
kind of automatic generation is being

462
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
used with a spin do you think it will be

463
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,160
easier to detect trolls uh given that

464
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,399
there is like some it's like not picking

465
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
from the whole distribution but already

466
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,440
always trying to pick from one

467
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,519
particular part of the distribution

468
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,880
i i i think that doing more analysis on

469
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
uh

470
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,880
suspected actors might might help a lot

471
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,000
so

472
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
because

473
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,399
they need to

474
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,199
those these models is automated so

475
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,959
if you have black box access you can

476
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,639
analyze if you don't have black box

477
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,040
access and you just analyze the post you

478
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
might need further

479
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
kind of analysis and doing more

480
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
forensics on top of it

481
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,380
all right let's thank eugene again

482
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,549
[Applause]
