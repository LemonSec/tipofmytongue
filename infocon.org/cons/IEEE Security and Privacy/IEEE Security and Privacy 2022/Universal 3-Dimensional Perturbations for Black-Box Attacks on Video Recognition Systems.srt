1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
um hi my name is my name is

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
and today i'm going to present our work

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
universal three-dimensional prohibitions

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,480
for black box attack on video

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,920
recognition system

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,440
so they said you want to work with my

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,799
colleague han

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
yukong and mad at the weather young home

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
so our paper is on the video attacks up

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
so what is adversarial tags so machine

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,760
learning models is known to be

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
vulnerable to the adversary prohibitions

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,359
in various domains such as image speech

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,000
text and video i'm sorry

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,399
so here is very famous example that

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,200
given image panda if we add a very minor

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,480
prohibitions

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
which is almost human imperceptible and

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
to this clean image panda we can turn

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,960
this panda into adversarial examples

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
which can be misclassified by the

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,079
machine engineering model to the

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
keyboard with very high confidence

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
so such adversely attack has been very

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
powerful evaluations for revealing the

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,239
machine learning model vulnerabilities

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,800
in aspect of robustness

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
so our paper focus on the video

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,400
recognition systems

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
that is integrate to the deep neural

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,439
network's audience in various tasks for

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
example the video classification on

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
normal detections action predictions and

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,240
there's a lot of bunch of numeracy and

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
models for for example 3d s3d which

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,799
almost

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
based on the learning special temporal

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,759
features

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
that could take

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
an example that the c3d contracted

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
three-dimensional convolution layers to

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439
extract

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
the temporal

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
features from the video

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,680
and

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,640
s3d is utilized in the anomaly detection

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
in 7s video

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,360
cameras and it can be computer normal

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
scores from the event or video

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,520
so there have been previous video

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,759
attacks which have some limitations the

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,960
first is

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,119
inherited from image attacks that the

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,280
video prohibitions could be easily

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
detected better on leaking of a timbre

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
consistency

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
on the other hand that the video

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
partition will require a very high

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840
completion

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
and another issue is called boundary

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,879
effect which refers to the misalignment

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
between the prohibitions and the input

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
videos which can cause the degradation

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
of attack performance

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
so such issue is first identified in the

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
previous video attacks

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,440
published in ndss 2018 which is the

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
first video attack and in blackboard

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
event about books

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
so yeah for our contributions we propose

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,160
a universal three-dimensional

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,599
prohibitions to attack video systems

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
and we can attack any videos at any

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
frames and our tackle can't work on a

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
black box

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
we will utilize a straggling model to

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,519
target the

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,519
to attack a higher model which has

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,720
abilities

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
and our attack can also achieve very

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
good human possibilities with strictly

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,000
bonded prohibition infinitely norm

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
besides we implement of

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,159
attack prototype by the main middle

85
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,959
attack to attack the video in real time

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,519
and we also evaluate our attack against

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
the mainstream defense

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
so before i go into the attack design

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
and observations we first define our

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
threat model so we consider to attack

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,480
scenarios the first is offline similar

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
to the conventional image attack that we

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
can add prohibitions to a stack of

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,440
videos to obtain to the adverse examples

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,519
and then attack the model

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
and we also consider the online case

97
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
that we can directly produce swimming

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
videos at any time

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
and correspondingly our adversary will

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
have two capabilities the first that we

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,040
can directly craft adverse examples of

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
land and we can also perform the main

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
middle attack to inject provisions in

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
real time

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
so our tech work and and the black box

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,319
setting and we will take a surrogate

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
model and a public asset to craft our

108
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,319
adversary's

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
probation by model

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,280
transfer abilities

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,159
so young framework could merely contract

112
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
a universal strategy noise to match the

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
video attack operation used 3d noise

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
so this r3g noise is based on the

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079
procedure noise which is

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
can be generated by some algorithms with

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
predefined functions

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
so this is originally used in computer

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,360
graphic

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
which can be

121
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,759
enriched the video details for example

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,600
texture and the shading

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
the advantage of this procedure noise is

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
that it can directly compute with a few

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
parameters and it has no noticeable

126
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
direction artifacts

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
so this advantage may make the person

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
noise to be partitionally fed for

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
contracting the adversary perturbations

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
so since the procedure noise is based on

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
the two-dimensional image and

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
we extend this procedure noise to match

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,280
the three-dimensional video attack

134
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
so we construct um the three-dimensional

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
kernels by using two popular noise

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,880
schemes named um protein and given noise

137
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
and

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
we added extra

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,199
temporal dimensions

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
and here is example that

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,880
we contract using u3d using pretty noise

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,560
so after we contracting our noise

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
let's talk about our tech framework so

144
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
the first is the local probation

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
generations and organizations

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
so we'll define the

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
following goals that we want to achieve

148
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
the high vulnerabilities

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
in the future space and we also

150
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
want our tech to be universal and to

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
perturb a large set of videos or unseen

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
data examples

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,479
and we want also addressing the

154
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
misalignment

155
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
in the video attacks

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
of course we want our attack to achieve

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
very good human impossibilities

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
so after we set our goals we will

159
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
optimize our probation

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,160
um and

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
then add it to the

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
real attack so

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
we want we first we also want to our

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
attack to bypass the current defense

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,479
schemes

166
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
and we have empirically validated that

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
our attack can mitigate the

168
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
uh current mainstream uh schemes like

169
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
adversary training detection staff

170
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
robustness

171
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,880
and we also want our tech to be

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
practical that by implementing a real

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
attack prototype

174
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
so um then we talk about the calibrate

175
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
our perturbations so for first goal that

176
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
we want to improve the processor

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
abilities so it has been shown that if

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
we're crafting the adverse examples in

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,280
the feature space like amount of

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
intermediate layers among the model

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
which can result in

182
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
highly transferable adverse examples and

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
so we define distant functions between

184
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,919
different layers in our model and

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,880
so we will maximize the adverse examples

186
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,639
and with original videos

187
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
and next we want to addressing the

188
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
boundary effect so

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
we define the actual physical

190
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
transformations by adding one extra and

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
temp shift functions so when we optimize

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
our probations we will add this shift

193
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,319
to the optimist optimization process so

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,280
we can

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,599
mitigate the boundary effect

196
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,160
and similarly we can also improving our

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,720
unifor attack universities with a small

198
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
set of videos and

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,840
so

200
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,919
i'm sorry okay

201
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
yeah better

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
so we can

203
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
we can also like improving the use of

204
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,560
universality with a small set of videos

205
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,599
and

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,319
so um and we also bonding our

207
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,520
perturbations in infinitely nonbound

208
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,759
and for these opening equations we kind

209
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,000
of tell us the hierarchical

210
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
algorithm for example the particle swarm

211
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
of nations pso to solve the problem and

212
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,280
it's pretty straightforward that we can

213
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,160
search on the optimum parameters in the

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,520
parameter space for 3d u3d

215
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
and let's look into the expandable

216
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
result so for the first we utilize the

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,759
streaming data sets hmd 51 and ucf 101

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,560
for video classification and a ucf

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
chrome dataset for a non-detection

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,479
and we also use like family models

221
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,039
to evaluate the transferabilities for

222
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,960
our tech

223
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,199
and here i want to go to in details to

224
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
introduce these

225
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,120
video models

226
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,240
and

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,719
so we mainly report attack performance

228
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,839
in case of the attack sex rate so for

229
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
the first part like we use the mtm db51

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
as public data sets and

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,800
uc-101 and the user of chrome datasets

232
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
for the video classification of

233
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
nomination respectively

234
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
and we will use c3d as regular model and

235
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,440
the c3d and s3d as a target model we

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,279
also choose like the gaussian noise and

237
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,920
the universe noise and you see u3d noise

238
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,959
we randomly picked up the parameters

239
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,040
besides we also unchoose a previous

240
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,839
baseline the cdup the previous ndss

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,800
paper

242
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
and you can see from the table that our

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,160
tech achiever play hair at excess rates

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,519
about

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,360
the 80 percent success rates

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
and for the transfer abilities we

247
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,160
evaluate our attack we define a transfer

248
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
rate that the percent of adverse

249
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
examples that craft on one model can be

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
attached to another model

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,839
and you can see our transfer

252
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
relativity here about at least like 80

253
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
percent

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
and for the universities we also

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
evaluate the three different data sets

256
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
and we

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
measure the text success rate as well

258
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
and here is a viewer addition of adverse

259
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,920
examples so for the first two rules is

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,839
our u3d noise and the third rule is the

261
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
baseline cdop

262
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,480
and we can clearly see that our

263
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
u3d based adverse examples achieve

264
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
better human possibilities

265
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
so we also measure the real-time

266
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
performance so here that we implement a

267
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
tech prototype by the main middle attack

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
to eject our probations to our streaming

269
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,279
videos so here we measure the

270
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,720
computational

271
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
cost which includes the encoding and

272
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,000
decoding operations for the video and

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
also include injector partitions so you

274
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
can see the total runtime is less still

275
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
less than the original video fps about

276
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,959
the

277
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,240
0.033 seconds

278
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
and we also showing two examples that

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
but after our perturbing and the

280
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,079
anomaly videos can be unconverted to the

281
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
normal videos

282
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
and the last we also evaluate our attack

283
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
against the main difference

284
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
so for the adversary training we

285
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
expressively adopted the so-called

286
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,920
universal adversary trainings that

287
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
specifically targeted for the universal

288
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
perturbations

289
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
and you can see the adversary changing

290
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
can defend our attack to simultaneously

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,839
however this reverse routine requires

292
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,560
actual knowledge of our us3d noise

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,200
besides its time and con is kind of

294
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
conventional

295
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,399
costly because it's like a maximum

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,000
operations

297
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
and we also evaluate the detections

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
with two popular methods and

299
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,640
the issue that our attack is more

300
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
difficult to detect

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,440
and last i want to we also evaluate the

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
state fair robustness which is

303
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
like random smoothing which utilities

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
occurs in noise at

305
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
the the input to save

306
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
the input with some boundary boundary

307
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,440
and

308
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
non-leaders so since the stem certified

309
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
robustness is cursed of the high

310
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,120
dimensional input so the safety

311
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
radius is pretty small for the

312
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
high high dimensional input values

313
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,639
so the slave robustness is still

314
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
like a kind of weak for defending the

315
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,839
video attacks

316
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
so to conclude we first identified the

317
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,160
critical vulnerabilities of video dna

318
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,959
models even equipped with state of arts

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,320
different scheme

320
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
and we implement a real prototype

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,560
for text streaming videos

322
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
and we believe our tech could motivate

323
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,639
some machine learning and security

324
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
researchers and developers to build more

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
robust video dna models

326
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
that's it

327
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
thank you for attention i'm happy to

328
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,930
take questions right now

329
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,280
[Applause]

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,959
please step up to the microphone if you

331
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
have any questions

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,880
maybe in the meantime i'll start with

333
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,720
one

334
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
yeah um so one of the baselines you

335
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
looked at um

336
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,560
repeatably initial can you hear yeah

337
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
yeah i can hear one of the baselines you

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
looked at randomly set the parameters

339
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
and yeah still high attack success rates

340
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
like 40 or 50 success rate yeah it seems

341
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
very high like what like what makes the

342
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
baseline so so strong i would say like

343
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,160
uh the first is like video and system

344
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,560
like video model based system is kind of

345
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,160
vulnerable you know to the adversary

346
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,839
attack which has been

347
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,160
identified before like we kind of want

348
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,720
to and another is like

349
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
the i think the 3d noise like have a

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
natural

351
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
or like like properties which can craft

352
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,440
craft the video features

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,600
you know yeah that's very nice um yeah

354
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,160
okay ask another then yeah

355
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,880
so

356
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,920
yeah please

357
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,160
feel free to um yeah please other people

358
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,360
can come otherwise always keep asking

359
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
questions we have we have time yes

360
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
thanks everyone um

361
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,920
also people online if you want to ask

362
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,440
any questions i don't haven't seen any

363
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
yet um

364
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
so

365
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,120
um

366
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
in the like detection task you're able

367
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,959
to add noise so that the the object is

368
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,639
like the or the event is not triggered

369
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,760
like the

370
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
anomaly detection you make you add noise

371
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
so there's no anomaly yeah did you look

372
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,600
at if you can add noise to make there be

373
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,480
an anomaly yes yes we we only choose

374
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,279
like

375
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,920
uh the an example like about to convert

376
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,360
anomaly to a

377
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
normal

378
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
is one of them harder than the other

379
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
yeah yeah it's kind of like uh because

380
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,760
the the

381
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,040
the mean um like the the video model as

382
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,519
a feature extractors and

383
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,360
the the normal scores is actually a

384
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,839
downstream task and our mini attack is

385
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,079
like com like like subover to the

386
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,120
feature extractor and so the normal

387
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
score computers will definitely

388
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
different if we uncraft the features

389
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
yeah

390
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,920
no other questions

391
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
okay i'll ask one more and then maybe

392
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,399
we'll maybe get one more final question

393
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,720
otherwise we'll stop so

394
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
um

395
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,920
it looks like the attacks on video seem

396
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,240
to be a lot more difficult and use a lot

397
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
more priors than attacks on images

398
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
because the attacks um do you think that

399
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
this is just fundamentally because video

400
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,800
is harder or or higher dimensional or

401
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,199
why why are these attacks why do video

402
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
attacks look different in nature than

403
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,839
attacks on images so i think like as i

404
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,160
mentioned like they have the actual like

405
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,399
temporal dimension like

406
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,440
which which is not like um

407
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,079
hard to attack but uh it's not can be

408
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,079
you know just directly utilize the image

409
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,880
attack to the video attack

410
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,000
and

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
another like everyone defends such video

412
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,800
attacks because the video

413
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,160
video is kind of

414
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,720
dynamic like it's not a static

415
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
you know uh two-dimensional images and

416
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,959
so for example we don't know like after

417
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
there has been like other barriers

418
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
uh

419
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
uh for example the video you know maybe

420
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
have the future

421
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,880
um

422
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
like

423
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
events and it could be hard like to

424
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
to see that if we attack it so it's it's

425
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
it's sometimes it will be hard to detect

426
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,480
the

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,160
attacks yeah

428
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,120
okay yeah

429
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,920
well

430
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,010
let's thank the speaker one more time

431
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,730
[Applause]
