1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,600
thank you for the introduction uh good

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
morning everyone uh my name's welcome to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
our presentation my name is ho chi chan

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
and i will be representing my colleagues

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
from university of florida and the

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
university of new hampshire to present

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,520
our work today the invisible finger a

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
practical electromagnetic interference

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,800
attack on touchscreen devices

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,359
so what exactly is our attack and in

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,920
short invisible finger is a remote

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,079
precise touchy vein injection attack

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,719
against a capacitive touchscreen device

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,840
using iemi signal so in detail there are

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
some characteristics associated with our

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
attack for instance our attack can be

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
used to inject touch events on

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,399
touchscreen devices from a distance up

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,079
to three centimeters

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
and our attack can introduce short tap

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
long press omnidirectional swipe on

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,000
touchscreen devices as well so it also

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,320
works on different type of device

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
touchscreen device with respect to

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,879
different scanning and driving mechanism

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,479
things like that

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,200
and comparing with previous touch screen

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,080
attacks it is also practical attack with

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
a combination of our

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
screen locators our touch event

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
detectors and we also build a website

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,040
you know to introduce our attack in

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
detail and

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,799
also there are some video demonstrations

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
so if you are interested uh please go

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,479
ahead and check it out later after this

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,520
presentation all right so before we jump

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
into the mid of our presentation i want

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,159
to show a quick video demonstration to

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
give a hand on what we can achieve using

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
our attacks okay so

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,240
once we generate a sufficient iemi

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
signal with certain parameters say

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
frequency voltage amplitude signal shape

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
things like that and we can generate a

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
short tab to induce a keystrokes we can

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
also turn that into a long press and we

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
eventually can turn into that any

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,600
duration omnidirectional swipe as you

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,759
can see on the screen and you can also

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
notice that there are three uh

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,119
acrylic shapes between the antennas and

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,598
between our target device so you can see

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,520
like the attack is launched from the

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
remote from a distance

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
so

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
one second

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
in detail today we'll be going to for

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
example a bit of background knowledge

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,959
and the theoretical analysis on

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,520
touchscreen devices and how to generate

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,840
a precise touch event and finally we'll

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
go to how do we conduct a practical

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
attack using such techniques

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,319
so for more than capacitive touchscreen

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,680
which everyone is using right now i

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
probably are holding that in your hands

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
right now and there are two main type of

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
capacitive touchscreen sensor technology

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
self-capacitive and mutual capacitive

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
sensors so a self-capacitive system

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
measures the change

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
in capacitance with respect to the

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,959
earth's ground while on the contrary the

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,840
mutual capacitive touchscreen devices

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
which allows the use to to use two

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
electrodes together and then it measures

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,599
the capacitance change when user finger

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
touches it so in our work we many target

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,200
on mutual capacitance touch screen as

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
it's actually going to be the major

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
capacitance technology that has been

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239
using widely in the field

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,440
so once we have a proper target that we

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
want we decide to attack now let's take

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
a look at this fundamentally how mutual

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
capacitance touchscreen works so the

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,000
mutual capacity touchscreen often

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
consists with

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
multiple pairs of transmitting and

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
receiving electrodes and excitation

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
signal generator qt sensor adc and micro

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
microprocessor etc etc

94
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,200
and when a human finger is presented on

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
the touchscreen so it alters the current

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,400
capacitance of the touchscreen and this

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
change can be either positive can be

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
either negative really depends on human

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
impedance variation and

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
so now we can see that fundamentally all

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
things this capacitance touchscreen just

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
does just you know measure the

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
capacitance and see if it changes if it

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
changes then there's a finger charge

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
that's it right so it's pretty simple

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
and but internally how does this

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
mechanism is implement in circuit level

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
so here we show a simplified version of

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
the touchscreen design which is also

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,478
known as charge transfer circuit

111
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,880
topology and on the left side we can see

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,759
that there's a we use a voltage source

113
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,280
to represent how electro's on touch

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
screen is charged by excitation signal

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
and on the right side we can see there's

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
an opm design to turn this kind of

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,919
capacitance in of the mutual capacitor

118
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,479
cm into a voltage view where you can

119
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,360
just use adc and such to measure it and

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
so this is why it's actually called

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
charge transfer circuit because the cm

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
gets charged and then the capacitance is

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
transferred to cs afterwards

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
so in order to make this circuit working

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
properly the switch of the chart transit

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
uh transfer topology is maybe

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,039
coordinated and be switched on off in a

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,199
pattern and in general this different

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
switch will be on off you know based on

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
the charging period sensing period

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
resetting period and such the frequency

132
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,199
of this switching signal is also

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
important uh to conduct attack which we

134
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
will discuss later so now we know that

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
human fingers touches us if the human

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
finger touch the screen then there will

137
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,320
be capacitance change but what about

138
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
when we have a emi noise so the emi

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
noise that is directly applied on the

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,680
touchscreen is equivalent to a tiny

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
voltage source that interferes with the

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
capacitance sensing part and eventually

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,880
be recognized as the voltage change and

144
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
the finger finger charge so now we have

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
a sufficient idea on how what is a touch

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,320
screen and how it exactly it works and

147
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
what makes our work different than

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,120
previous approaches so we know that if i

149
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
work in siri you know to act like

150
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
fingers but what kind of emi signal

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
actually works and can be recognized as

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
a touch event so here comes our one of

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,720
our major contribution we couple the

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,199
theoretical analysis and the actual

155
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,639
attack vectors

156
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,039
as we see before that the charge

157
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,919
transfer sensor also known as qt sensor

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,400
measures the capacitance right and if

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,479
there's a finger touch finger touch the

160
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,240
capacitance changes the voltage change

161
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
the voltage output of opm changes you

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,039
know if there's touch so now let's say

163
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,039
if we are using a sine wave i am a

164
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
signal as v and you know perform this

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
similar approach approach and we can

166
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
also see the major voltage changes and

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
the passive threshold and basically in

168
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,199
siri we just induce attachment

169
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
using our current model we can get the

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,560
needed amplitude and frequency to induce

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
enough voltage changes and that can be

172
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
recognized as a touch event although we

173
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
don't really show a very detailed uh

174
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
duration process over here because like

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,039
in the paper we spent two and a half

176
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
pages on doing that so we don't have

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
enough to in time time today but

178
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
uh the needed voltage is actually

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,479
associated with the mutual capacitance

180
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
charge transfer capacitance and qt

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
sensor switching frequency and the

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,520
switching signal duties etc

183
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,759
so we also provided the needed frequency

184
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
here but you should notice that most

185
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
importantly that the frequency of

186
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,160
inducing a successful attack is actually

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,479
not unique there's multiple frequency

188
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,000
you know based on our serial analysis

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,599
removable frequency can be used to

190
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
induce a successful touch event and but

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
that's just a theory like we need to

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,319
validate it right so how do we validate

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
our model and analysis we use a

194
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
chromebook which is equipped with

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
touchscreen diagnostic software to

196
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
perform the data collection and

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
while we're applying the imi signal and

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
we use two copper plates once on the

199
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
front of the panel the lead and once on

200
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,120
the another one is on the back side of

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,160
it to induce the iem

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,720
as antenna so the chromebook

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,759
diagnostic software will tell us when

204
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
where and how event touchy bank is

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
generated so now we can try all the

206
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,479
combination of the e field the strings

207
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
the frequency and see if our equation is

208
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,520
correct or not right so by recording the

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
minimum e field that is and associated

210
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,400
frequency that we can induce

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
the touch event we can notice that

212
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,639
there's a pattern of the recorded uh e

213
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,520
field which is aligned with our equation

214
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,759
and our analysis so in a word mentioned

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
that different touch event a different

216
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
touch screen will have like a different

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
parameters and the design is a little

218
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
bit different but still our analysis

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,399
will just allow us to narrow down what

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
could be the combination of the e-fuel

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
strength and what could come

222
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,200
and what could be

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
the uh iemi signal attack frequency so

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
you can just perform this kind of attack

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
quick and fast

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
so once we know how to generate the

227
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,360
touch event using our calculated imi

228
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
signal parameter and we now need to

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,279
resolve the issue

230
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
how do we make this attack accurate and

231
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,680
precise so comparing with the previous

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
approach it was which was published on

233
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
smp and usenix recently and another one

234
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,399
of our major contribution lies on

235
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
generating a precise touch event and

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,880
conducting solo experiments

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,600
so

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
what is a challenge exactly you know of

239
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
generating a precise touch but the

240
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
challenge comes from sensing and driving

241
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
mechanism used by different touchscreen

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
controller in general there are two type

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
of the method to perform scanning or

244
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
driving on electrical grid so one of

245
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,040
them is sequential and one of them is uh

246
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
it's parallel so the sequential scanning

247
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
scanning mechanic mechanism will excise

248
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,200
the x or y electrodes one by one and

249
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
then sends each line on y or x

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,279
electrodes respectively and where

251
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,920
the parallel scanning will try to encode

252
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,399
this excitation signal and drives x or y

253
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,720
electrodes on the same time and then

254
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,040
sensor the other side of the uh

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
electrodes

256
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,200
and try to measure the capacitance so on

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
this slice we can also see how this kind

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,519
of driving signal actually looks like

259
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,360
you know on a real device one of them is

260
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
collected on iphone 11 or pro and

261
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
another one is correct on pixel with

262
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
respect to a

263
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
parallel and sequential driving

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
mechanism so the previous approach

265
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,160
generally only works on you know on

266
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
sequential driving mechanism where

267
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
because you know there's a certain

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,519
pattern and this padding is actually

269
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
pretty easy to identify right so the

270
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
attacker can measure the driving signal

271
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
and choose what is the correct timing to

272
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,680
inject the iemi signal and however it

273
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
like for example just like this like the

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,279
attacker trying to measure and see okay

275
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,680
this is the time this column or this row

276
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
is measured this is excited i'm going to

277
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
inject i am a signal at this precise

278
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
moment to uh make sure to make this

279
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,839
press

280
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,760
touch event precise

281
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
but as you can also see because the

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
parallel scanning is all on the same

283
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
time so it won't really work when the

284
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,399
touchscreen

285
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
uses embedded parallel driving mechanism

286
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
so our attack which on the country does

287
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
not require a particular driving

288
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
mechanism instead we use antenna design

289
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
where it can generate

290
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
actually a very focused field to apply

291
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,839
the interference on the very specific

292
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
and narrow region on your touch screen

293
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
and we apply this appropriate emi signal

294
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
and we wait for that place to be scanned

295
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,519
by the touchscreen controller which is

296
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
just like human fingers right so your

297
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
fingers is actually like pressing the uh

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,399
pressing the screen and it will be

299
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
scanned sometime and we are basically

300
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,480
mimicking the same way that that works

301
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
so just like a human finger that comes

302
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
our title in the invisible finger right

303
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
so another advantage brought about

304
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,480
attack is that we don't not need to

305
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
analyze how this driving signal of

306
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
different touchscreen controller and

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
this is how they are designed and where

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
are the correctly timing yeah you need

309
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
to measure that you need to know okay

310
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,519
this is line is the one i'm going to

311
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,120
attack right so we don't really do that

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,079
kind of thing

313
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,720
anymore all we need to as as you can see

314
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
that we don't need to do all any kind of

315
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,880
encoding and we don't care that what is

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
the driving signal looks like so we test

317
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
our attack on different smart cell phone

318
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,360
tablets from different vendors including

319
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,800
apple google oneplus and even microsoft

320
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,600
and

321
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
we also show that all the devices

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
vulnerable to our attack while the

323
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
previous timing based iem injection

324
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,040
which was published before and that we

325
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,079
only was tested on the nexus 5 and so we

326
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,040
increased our test test bench

327
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,360
largely and another noticeable

328
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
achievement our attack also on certain

329
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,000
time platforms like for example on ipad

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,560
pro and surface pro 7 we can even

331
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
achieve like for we can even perform

332
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,920
swipe gesture with any duration so in

333
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
general our attack works better on iot

334
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
ios device than android device we think

335
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,639
whatever the noise cancellation of

336
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,560
algorithm was employed on ios

337
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,360
touchscreen controller or just the os

338
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
driver level kind of actually makes our

339
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,320
attack more efficient and more precise

340
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,079
so now we have a way to know what kind

341
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
of emi signal we want to use to perform

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,480
a touch touch event injection and we can

343
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
also perform tab press and i mean

344
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
directional swipe and things like that

345
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
with such signal so but everything is

346
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
done by us just you know look into the

347
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
device and try to use our antenna you

348
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,639
know to inject the touch event right so

349
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,720
we're not even close to actually using

350
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,079
this attack a real scenario so then this

351
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,880
is our third contribution um

352
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
we present complete practical attack

353
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,839
vectors so a sequence now we have

354
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,200
established a serial background

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
knowledge and actual setup you know to

356
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,360
induce a touch event but we're still

357
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
missing a really important part right so

358
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,079
in real scenario attack devices probably

359
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,800
is attached at the you know as a under

360
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
the table and the phone for example you

361
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,199
see the victim walks around walks

362
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
towards the table and then place his or

363
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,600
her cell phone directly on the table and

364
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
the phone will be randomly located so as

365
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
the attacker we won't know that where

366
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,639
the phone is located and so in that case

367
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
we develop a phone locator techniques

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,639
and also for the attack scenario there's

369
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,560
multiple touches at multiple uh

370
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
locations and sometimes there is even a

371
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,440
swipe gesture this kind of like a

372
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
gesture involved if you want to perform

373
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
a successful attack so in that case we

374
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
develop a touch event detector to

375
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
resolve this issue so as for the phone

376
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,199
locator a little bit recap on what the

377
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,199
uh driving signal is actually looks like

378
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,199
on different uh device and we can see

379
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,959
that for different role or column the

380
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
driving signal actually looks different

381
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
this applies to either sequential or

382
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
or parallel driving mechanism and we can

383
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
use this pattern to recover where the

384
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
phone located so we know ahead that how

385
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,680
our antenna is located how our antenna

386
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,000
is organized and we call and we can use

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
our antenna to measure what the signal

388
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
looks like on the touch screen and using

389
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
these two information combine these two

390
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
information together we can now know we

391
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,279
can now use that to recover the precise

392
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
location and precise orientation of the

393
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
target device and we can also see that

394
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
if we are using of we are if we are

395
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,279
using more antenna than we are the more

396
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,800
accurate we can recover the phone

397
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
location for instance like we are using

398
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
12 antennas simultaneously right now and

399
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
we can locate our target device without

400
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
any displacement so as for the touch

401
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,480
event detector we notice that there's

402
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
many of this smartphone will actively

403
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
increase active scanning period when

404
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,279
zero to attach and it's detected so it

405
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,120
can make it it runs a little bit more

406
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
smooth and runs a little bit more

407
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
accurate

408
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
so as shown this figure once we stop

409
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,560
this type of inject emi injection the

410
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
driving signal pattern that we measured

411
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
from is actually different depending on

412
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
whether this injection is successful or

413
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
not so this will tell you that the

414
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
previous iem attack is successful not so

415
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
you can long you can decide whether i

416
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
should perform the next run of the year

417
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
my injection to repeat that or should i

418
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
just move the antenna to a different

419
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
place and then perform for the next

420
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
stage of the attack so combining all

421
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
these different aforementioned

422
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,320
techniques together now we have achieved

423
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
a successful attack on the following

424
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
scenarios and you can find the detail of

425
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,560
this kind of attack on our paper so for

426
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,639
the clickbank attack we have malicious

427
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
application installation on android

428
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
device we can also connect to malicious

429
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,519
bluetooth profile on ios device and

430
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
for more complicated gesture based

431
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,839
attack we can send messages you know

432
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,440
which of all involved with different

433
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
keystrokes and we can also use uh use

434
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,040
press and hold on paypal icon to choose

435
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
a qr code we can just scan it and then

436
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,839
you know transfer money right and more

437
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,560
complicatedly we can use omnidirectional

438
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,880
gesture attack to unlock your cell phone

439
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
if you are using gesture unlocking

440
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
mechanism and i'm pretty sure there's

441
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
more interesting attacks which you can

442
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
achieve using our techniques but as for

443
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,720
the mitigation we propose and evaluate

444
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
two mitigations in our paper from vendor

445
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
side we can use pressure detection to

446
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,880
decide whether their legitimate user

447
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
touch or from the user side a very

448
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
simple fabric uh friday fabric is

449
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
totally enough to protect yourself from

450
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,280
the emi attack so um again like our all

451
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,199
of our details are our papers our video

452
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
demonstration is stored on our website

453
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
so if you're interested there's more you

454
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,319
know fun videos where you can watch and

455
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,160
so that'll be for all for today and

456
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,839
thank you guys for listening my talk

457
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,039
please let me know if you have any

458
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
questions or suggestions all right

459
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
all right let's thank our speaker thank

460
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
you

461
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
and one really quick question for you uh

462
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
yeah so you mentioned being able to you

463
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
know change the or

464
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
recognize the position of the phone yes

465
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
can you actually recognize the type of

466
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
device that you have because it seems

467
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
like you have a variety of um accuracies

468
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,520
yes that might

469
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,039
change your results right right right

470
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,320
that's a really good question because

471
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,440
like as far we uh we run tests we run

472
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
tests around on around like 11 different

473
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
type of device from different vendors

474
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
and as we can see that when we measure

475
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
that the driving signal that we can

476
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
measure are totally different on

477
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
different devices so the moment you see

478
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
that you can just

479
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
categorize that into a certain device

480
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,160
fantastic thank you i just want to have

481
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,559
one quick note before we uh we take uh

482
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
questions from the microphone i've been

483
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
trying all session to get the hop in to

484
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
work to take questions online and i i

485
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
can't so folks who are watching this

486
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,360
online my apologies you're not being

487
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
ignored i just can't see you at all so

488
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,760
with that we have a big line of folks

489
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
here and plenty of time please ask away

490
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
yeah uh thanks for the talk uh i'm tren

491
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
wang from irsu

492
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,039
so have you already applied your attack

493
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,880
to

494
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
multiple finger touch so the multiple

495
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,799
finger target what we does it like

496
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,600
every antenna we use can be generated

497
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,360
for like a single touch at single

498
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
position so the way we does for

499
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
multi-touch is applying different

500
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
antennas at different positions and

501
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
apply for the iem signal at different

502
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
locations so we've done that on ipad

503
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
we've done that for the surface we've

504
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,679
done that on certain iphone but that's

505
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,919
not really generic where we can use on

506
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,760
like for example a lot of android device

507
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
yet oh so there's no uh inter

508
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
interference there's no interface like

509
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
we actually measure interface like the

510
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,080
antenna distance the minimum antenna

511
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
distance can be around five millimeter

512
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
and uh because i like the shape of the

513
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,559
tenon we use so like they really cause

514
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,120
the interference between the uh imi ten

515
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,039
that we use

516
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,520
one quick question yeah so have you uh

517
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
uh so i wonder uh because the touch

518
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,160
screen event the target event can also

519
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
capture the touch area and the touch

520
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
pressure yeah still think that would be

521
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
an easy way to

522
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,840
right exactly that's actually another

523
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
another way to mitigate this kind of

524
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
attack that's precise uh precise yeah

525
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
thank you yeah make sure you um

526
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,360
introduce yourself as you ask your

527
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,600
questions

528
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,679
okay hi i'm surya there from penn state

529
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,640
um

530
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
so first and foremost fantastic

531
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,200
presentation and work thank you and uh

532
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,840
the first question that i had for you

533
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,960
was you said that the minimum distance

534
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,880
between the antenna and the screen is uh

535
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
five millimeters five millimeters but

536
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
what's the maximum distance how

537
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
so uh the way we does this kind of the

538
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,840
multi-touch or anything like that is

539
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
actually we build antenna array as we

540
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,120
also show on the video like we have

541
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
antenna over here we have antenna over

542
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
here and the maximum distance doesn't

543
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
really matter so it depends on what is

544
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
the size of your uh

545
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
of your target device and how many

546
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
different channels of imi signal you

547
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,720
want to apply this on so like the

548
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,559
distance the maximum distance we don't

549
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,000
really have a limitation for that it's

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
more or less like

551
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
if we get too close they may this

552
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,120
antenna is going to interfere with that

553
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,520
antenna so it makes the uh result is a

554
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,840
little bit inconsistent okay yeah

555
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,159
awesome and uh you mentioned that

556
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,080
placing your entire setup underneath the

557
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,440
table to attack on that so uh i'm sure

558
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
that you probably have some of this

559
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
stuff on your demonstrations but

560
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,360
what kind of materials of the table have

561
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,679
you actually tried this on good question

562
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,559
unless the table we also have done the

563
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,880
evaluation in our paper as well so

564
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,679
unless your table is using use like a

565
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
con is made with some kind of metal

566
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,000
which yeah which will block this yeah my

567
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
signal otherwise wooden acrylic

568
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,159
everything just works fine okay yeah

569
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,080
yeah so the fundamental part is like

570
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
your table cannot block the iem a signal

571
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,159
that's it all right yeah all right thank

572
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,400
you thank you so much for answering

573
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
hi i'm daniel antonioli from eurocom

574
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
and in your evaluation slide you've

575
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
shown that you attack different

576
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,679
platforms from different lenders

577
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,240
and i was wondering if you disclosed

578
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
these attacks to the vendors so what did

579
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,200
they say that's a good thing uh where

580
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,280
like we think this type of attack

581
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
although we show how to practically

582
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
attack but there's still a lot of effort

583
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,559
you need to do it's not like you're

584
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,159
walking in some conference like you can

585
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,679
expect that kind of thing happens like

586
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,880
as you also notice that how giant

587
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,440
our if amplifier can be so in that case

588
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
we think at this moment we don't really

589
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
see a

590
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,159
emerging threat that people will be

591
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,760
using this kind of attack

592
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,720
to to

593
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,960
uh to actually you know attack people

594
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
and but more importantly we think this

595
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
is more or less like how the touchscreen

596
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
controller vendor instead of how is a

597
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
smartphone vendor because they normally

598
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
just purchase this kind of solution from

599
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
admiral from you know max attacks is a

600
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,760
kind of uh vendor we all we did talk

601
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
with some of them and they think it's

602
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
just a matter of you know whether they

603
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
want to use a more advanced noise

604
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
elimination algorithm or not but they

605
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
don't really think this uh

606
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
this attack you know they just say yeah

607
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,559
this this is a type of like a

608
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,480
interference but that's it

609
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,159
yeah so yeah the practicality of the

610
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
attack is kind of right right yeah if

611
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,640
you go back to the slide about the

612
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,720
attack scenario uh

613
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,240
the attacks in arrow

614
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
the attack

615
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,559
yeah yeah

616
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,960
so i was wondering how are you detecting

617
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,840
when

618
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
you can you know send this malicious

619
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,280
click to install an app

620
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,919
so okay i see that case oh and second

621
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,520
question is

622
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
uh sometimes when you have to already

623
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,000
interrupt we have about 30 seconds left

624
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
so if you want to get maybe one of those

625
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
questions in that would be great and

626
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
then please yeah i mean

627
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
right right so okay yeah

628
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,840
uh yeah so for the uh malicious

629
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,280
application installation like what we

630
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,679
does like we actually send uh so that's

631
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,080
our assumption we know the target device

632
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
target devices the phone number so we

633
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
can just send a message over there and

634
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
at over there there will be a preview

635
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
where we can know this preview is

636
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
actually located and we just touch in

637
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
injector type event at that precise

638
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,000
array every starting area then we can

639
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
just open that event open that window

640
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
and then try to proceed for uh

641
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,320
installation and this is definitely

642
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,080
complicated because we measure that

643
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,559
there probably are five six distinct

644
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
touch events should be involved and so

645
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
you have like a six or five antenna

646
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
placed at different place different

647
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,720
location to inject this type event one

648
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,039
by one at a different location to to

649
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,840
eventually install this type of

650
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,760
application all right thanks

651
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
thank all of our speakers this is the
