1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,240
all right hi everyone thanks again for

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,560
your patience i'm sophie and i'm excited

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,120
to talk about our work

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,679
so ar and vr or augmented reality and

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,080
virtual reality devices are being used

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,679
in some really sensitive contexts these

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,640
days like medicine the military and more

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
and further they are projected to become

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,199
the next generation of personal devices

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
so either way these devices will be in

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,039
the hands of users who are interacting

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,119
with sensitive data and those users will

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,640
need authentication to keep that data

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
safe now passwords are obviously the

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,558
most

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,320
obvious option

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
they're the default on most other

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,000
platforms but passwords don't really

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,480
work on ar and vr super well

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,239
when a user tries to authenticate using

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
a password on ar and vr they see this

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
virtual keyboard floating in front of

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
them and they have to click with their

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
hand or controller by selecting

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
individual keys

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,640
and i speak from experience this is not

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
a usable or accessible process by any

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,399
means

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,800
and unfortunately this poor usability

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,199
also means that there's poor security by

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
using passwords and air in vr for

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
example the slow speed of actions as

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,280
well as the observability of those

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
actions means users are vulnerable to

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
shoulder surfing

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
fortunately ar and vr present some

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
unique possibilities some interesting

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,479
inputs and outputs that could

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
potentially allow them to help us move

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
beyond passwords for example we could

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,400
leverage these sensors for multi-factor

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
authentication or biometrics the

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,600
possibilities are really exciting and we

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
argue that now is the right time to

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
synthesize authentication for ar and vr

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
so that sub-optimal techniques like

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,079
passwords are not set in stone

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,200
our work does that with a

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
non-traditional sok

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,880
so we don't just look at academic

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,920
literature we take a more broad approach

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
that helps to get a bigger sense of the

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
gap between research and practice

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
we start with a survey of users and

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
developers to see what their needs and

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,079
wants are for ar and vr authentication

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,079
and from their comments we distill a set

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,360
of 20 evaluation criteria

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
we then use these criteria to evaluate

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,160
the state of ar and vr authentication in

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
current apps as well as in methods

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
proposed in prior work

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,400
in this way we can get a good

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
comprehensive sense of the state of ar

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
and vr authentication

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
i'll start by talking about our survey

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
and evaluation criteria

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
so for our survey we wanted to ask two

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
main questions for users which

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
authentication methods have they used on

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,640
air and vr and what did they think about

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
the usability and security of those

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,519
methods

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,440
for developers we wanted to know which

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
authentication methods they chose to use

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
when developing apps and what influenced

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,920
those decisions

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
we recruited our participants from

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,160
online platforms like reddit and ended

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
up considering responses from 139 users

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
and 49 developers within those users

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
finally we took their comments and

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
defined our set of evaluation criteria

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
that reflect the needs and wants of

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
users and developers

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
we identified 20 properties for

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
evaluation which fell into four main

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
categories in no particular order

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
deployability

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
usability accessibility

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,920
and security i'm not going to go into

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
all these in detail

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,159
um

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
but when you scan over these properties

95
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,519
you may notice that there is some

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
overlap with prior work for example

97
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
notably but know it all's quest to

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
replace passwords was inspirational to

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
us

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
but the difference between our work and

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,239
prior work is that our work specifically

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,920
notes the unique challenges of ar and vr

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
for example

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
since these devices are moving towards

105
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
standalone authentication for ar and vr

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
will need to be low power consumption

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
since these are already power

108
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,400
constrained devices

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
they will need to not require the user

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,720
to have a secondary device and they will

111
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
need to be acceptable for users who want

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
to authenticate in public

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,159
again this is just a taste of the

114
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
properties we came up with please see

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,879
the paper for more details

116
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,480
so now that we have our evaluation

117
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
criteria we're going to use that to

118
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
evaluate the state of ar and vr

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,519
authentication currently used in apps

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,200
and later we'll compare that to methods

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,839
proposed in practice

122
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
to evaluate the state of current air and

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,960
vr auth we looked at two devices the

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,199
hololens 2 an ar device that is

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
standalone and the htc vive a pc

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
tethered vr device

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
for each device we investigated the

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,800
authentication methods used in apps as

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,639
well as the authentication method used

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,840
when the user first puts the headset on

131
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,800
over 178 apps we identified seven unique

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
authentication methods in use and we

133
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
evaluated each of these methods on the

134
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,440
properties i talked about before

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
the most popular method we found or the

136
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,199
type of method is knowledge based

137
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,320
methods by far so this was passwords

138
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,639
pins and paired accounts so for example

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
logging in with the users microsoft

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,639
username and password

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,120
and in fact these were so popular that

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
of the 78 apps that used authentication

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,880
72 percent of them only offered a

144
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
password or a paired account

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,199
uh so we hypothesized that this

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
popularity may be due to their great

147
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
deployability in our survey users valued

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,120
methods that can be used across

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
platforms which is certainly something

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
that these can do

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
but unfortunately as i talked about

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
before these methods have very poor

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,919
usability and accessibility on ar and vr

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,800
and as a result the security is also bad

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
so let's instead look to

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
some possibly better methods on air in

157
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
vr token-based methods

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,520
we identified two token-based methods qr

159
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,560
codes and a short code which is where

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,479
short code appears on the headset and

161
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
the user enters that code on another

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
device

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
these have a bit better security than

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
the methods i talked about before due to

165
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
their one-time nature

166
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,160
and also they have better usability and

167
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
they don't the user doesn't have to

168
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
enter something on the cumbersome

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
virtual keyboard they can instead just

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,280
look at a qr code for example

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,039
unfortunately these methods have the

172
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,520
caveat but they also require a secondary

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
device which if these devices are going

174
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
to be standalone the requirement of a

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,479
secondary phone or laptop is not going

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,240
to align with the future direction of ar

177
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
and vr

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,400
so

179
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
these are the two most promising

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,199
methods that we found

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
iris scan and something called an

182
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
automatic paired account

183
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
which is a little bit different than the

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,080
regular paired account i talked about

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
earlier so i'm going to go through an

186
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
example

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,680
that we saw in some htc five apps

188
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
so the user first logs into their

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
viveport account to use the headset

190
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
and that that's done in the pc

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,039
and once they put the headset on they

192
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
can now access their library of apps if

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
they open an app which uses automatic

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
paired account

195
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
they are automatically authenticated to

196
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
that viveport account without having to

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
re-enter a username or password

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
and that means that automatic paired

199
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840
account is extremely usable

200
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
and it plus iris scan

201
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
which we know and love are the most

202
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,039
promising methods we identified

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
as i said these have great usability and

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
accessibility

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
beyond the initial login automatic

206
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
paired account does not require the user

207
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,440
to do anything

208
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
an iris scan is of course effortless as

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,160
well

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
they both have strong security by

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,919
removing the observable actions of

212
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,280
passwords

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
and additionally iris scan is very

214
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,560
accurate at least microsoft's

215
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,400
implementation

216
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
for deployability they differ a bit

217
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
automatic paired account is as

218
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
deployable as a regular paired account

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,400
which is very deployable

220
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
but iris scan is of course not available

221
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
on all devices and not even all ar and

222
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
vr devices so that may hinder its use in

223
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
the future

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,479
and additionally both have some

225
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,720
potential privacy issues for automatic

226
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,639
pair to count there is a possibility

227
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
that one device manufacturer could learn

228
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
about all the accounts a user has on

229
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,160
their device and for iris skin of course

230
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
there's the use of biometric data

231
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
but all in all these are some very

232
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,720
promising methods and i think are a good

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,080
direction to look for in the future

234
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,199
all right so we've talked about the

235
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,440
state of authentication and current apps

236
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
let's now turn to

237
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
authentication for arvr proposed in

238
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
prior work

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
to evaluate proposed methods we first

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
queried google scholar for papers that

241
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,479
presented new authentication methods

242
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,799
specifically for ar and vr

243
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
and this was kind of a specific search

244
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,958
so we didn't come up with a ton at first

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,559
and we crawled the references of the

246
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
papers we found to identify more

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,799
relevant work we ended up finding 38

248
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,160
papers which presented 43 mechanisms in

249
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,320
total which is a lot more than the seven

250
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,200
we identified in practice

251
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
we evaluated each of these 43 methods

252
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
and used the reported results in each

253
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,240
paper to do the evaluation

254
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
once again knowledge based methods were

255
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,160
the most popular

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,720
and i have some examples up on the slide

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
they fell into two main categories

258
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
though within those categories that are

259
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
very varied

260
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,640
numeric pins and graphical pins so for

261
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
example number one by changadol is

262
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
numeric pin where the user speaks the

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
red digits that correspond with the

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
white digits of their pin

265
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
and all in all these have good

266
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,800
deployability just like the incumbents a

267
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
lot of them are already supported by the

268
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
os a lot of them can be used on all

269
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
platforms or most platforms

270
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,399
and they also have some improved

271
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
security over the incumbent methods for

272
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
example the use of obfuscation like in

273
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
number one

274
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
can help prevent that shoulder surfing

275
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,800
issue or the use of gaze

276
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
to enter stuff instead of using

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
observable actions can also prevent

278
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
shoulder surfing

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
additionally these changes can help to

280
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
improve usability but the usability of

281
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
these methods is still not great because

282
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
the user has to enter a secret

283
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,160
and that brings me to the proposed

284
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,680
biometrics

285
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,640
we saw many very interesting biometrics

286
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
in our analysis and they fell into two

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
categories once again physical

288
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,880
biometrics which measure the inherent

289
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,440
shape of the user's body and behavioral

290
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
biometrics which measure their

291
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,040
characteristic movements or behavior

292
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,279
and what was great about these methods

293
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,600
specifically the physical biometrics is

294
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
that they are very usable and accessible

295
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
the physical biometrics we saw require

296
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,880
almost no user effort at all for example

297
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
number five the sound conduction method

298
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
called skull conduct measures the

299
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
characteristic frequency response of

300
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,920
sound through the user's skull and the

301
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
user doesn't have to do anything while

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
that's happening

303
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,240
unfortunately though usability is is one

304
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
of the main draws of biometrics the

305
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
behavioral biometrics didn't quite get

306
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
that benefit as much

307
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
and that the reason for that is that

308
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,079
they require the active movement the

309
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,079
behaviors that that make it a behavioral

310
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,519
biometric

311
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,000
and those can be move excuse me moving

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
virtual balls from a bin to a tower

313
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,680
or walking but either way

314
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
the the requirement of these active

315
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
movements reduces the usability of these

316
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
methods

317
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
further biometrics as a whole are not

318
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
quite deployable they are definitely not

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
supported by the os yet and

320
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,079
you really can't use a lot of these

321
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,720
methods on other platforms

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
further a lot of these are quite in

323
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,279
their early stages

324
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
the accuracy proves that these are valid

325
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,440
methods of authentication but there are

326
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
still false positives and false

327
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
negatives that harm security as well as

328
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
usability

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,480
but overall i really think that

330
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
biometrics are a very interesting

331
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,000
direction we need to move forward in for

332
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
ar and vr

333
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
and finally we saw three multi-factor

334
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,360
methods so these provided a knowledge

335
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,839
base method in conjunction with a

336
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
biometric

337
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
and what was great about the

338
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
multi-factor methods is that they had

339
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
the best security in our analysis if

340
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,480
someone needs to break into

341
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
an app that uses a multi-factor method

342
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
they need to guess the secret and then

343
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
they need to spoof the biometric

344
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
so this layered approach is great for

345
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
security and additionally these are some

346
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
of the only methods that could say the

347
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
word quasi platform agnostic for example

348
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
this number nine is a rubik's cube pin

349
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
where they also measure the

350
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,279
biometrics of the controller while

351
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
you're entering the pin

352
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,639
and on other platforms this could just

353
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,519
be flattened to be a pin right

354
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,279
however of course this would reduce the

355
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
security a bit as a pin is not really

356
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
resilient to guessing on its own

357
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
but overall being platform agnostic is

358
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
really important to developers as we saw

359
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,959
in our survey so this benefit i think is

360
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,200
something that makes us

361
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,880
really consider multi-factor methods in

362
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
the future

363
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,399
i will leave you with some future

364
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,760
directions

365
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
so first of all i've said this a bunch

366
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
of times in the talk we need to focus on

367
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,959
deployability

368
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
getting these methods in the hands of

369
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
developers will help us get them in the

370
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,360
hands of users so deployability is of

371
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,279
the utmost importance

372
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,639
further we need to strengthen these

373
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,880
biometrics there are so many exciting

374
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
options that we saw in our analysis

375
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
but in order for them to get used we

376
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,680
need to strengthen their accuracy

377
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,839
consider the privacy implications and

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,560
provide platform support

379
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,079
further we need to consider this

380
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,680
automatic paired account option this

381
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
federated login

382
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
it provided seamless authentication for

383
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
users but we didn't see it on the other

384
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,639
device we analyzed the hololens 2.

385
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
so we need to look at why this is not

386
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,560
more widely used and what the drawbacks

387
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
might be

388
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
and finally in the meantime when we move

389
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
towards more usable methods

390
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
let's try and make password managers

391
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
more available to users on air and vr to

392
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
reduce their burden in the meantime

393
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,639
summary we created evaluation properties

394
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
for air and vr authentication and used

395
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
them to evaluate the state of current ar

396
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
and vr apps

397
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,560
the authentication and current air and

398
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,240
vr apps as well as proposed methods my

399
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,079
contact information is on the slide so

400
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,920
please feel free to talk to me with any

401
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,890
questions and thank you

402
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,959
[Applause]

403
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
hi i'm dan bailey i really enjoyed your

404
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
talk thank you so much for it i had a

405
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,720
question about the automatic parrot

406
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,560
account how do you see those working

407
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
with wireless devices

408
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
could you elaborate a little bit more

409
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
sorry well i can see that if you are

410
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
using an htc vive and a plug straight

411
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,320
into your computer yes all you need to

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,639
do is log in to your computer and now

413
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,720
you have a trusted usb connection off to

414
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,959
the off to the vive but that's not

415
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,560
always the case with you know wireless

416
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
devices yeah that's a great question um

417
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
so

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
a lot of these devices whether they're

419
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
tethered or not require the user to sign

420
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
into an account in order to use the

421
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,320
device so for example the hololens 2 you

422
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
sign into your microsoft account

423
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,880
so theoretically that microsoft account

424
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
would just get leveraged instead of the

425
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,399
viveport account which is used on the

426
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
htc five does that make sense yeah

427
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
thank you

428
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
thank you

429
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,760
do we have any other questions

430
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
yeah go ahead

431
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
hi so with the physical and biometrical

432
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
evaluation methods did you notice any

433
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
privacy issues such as fingerprinting

434
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,279
that could be employed with those

435
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,839
no we didn't we more considered privacy

436
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
as just a general issue like the fact

437
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
that a method uses biometrics at all

438
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
so we didn't really get into that but

439
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,800
thank you for asking okay thank you

440
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,160
maybe we can take one final question

441
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
yeah

442
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
hey kurt thomas google i was wondering

443
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
when we talk about ar vr space

444
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
how do you think about recovery or even

445
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
shareability which are all great things

446
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,959
we have with passwords right now

447
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,920
um

448
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,079
shareability like using having shared

449
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
devices

450
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,519
more the ability to say like i can share

451
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,199
my passwords with anybody there's not

452
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,560
like a notion that it's intrinsically

453
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,120
tied to me like a biometric would be

454
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
ah i see yeah we didn't really look into

455
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
that in our analysis at all um and i

456
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,839
know we're running out of time so do you

457
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,199
want to grab me after and we can talk

458
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
about it happy too thank you

459
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,160
yeah let's thank sophie again for the

460
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
interesting talk
