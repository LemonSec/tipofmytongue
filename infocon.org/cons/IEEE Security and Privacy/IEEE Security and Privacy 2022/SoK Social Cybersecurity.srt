1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,240
okay

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,400
hi

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,799
um hi everyone my name is uc woo and i'm

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,480
a phd student at georgia tech's school

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
of interactive computing and today i'll

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,559
be presenting our sok paper on social

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,240
cyber security that was co-authored with

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,600
my advisors keith edwards and travikdas

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
so many end user smp behaviors are

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,480
inherently social we share info about

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,800
ourselves with our social networks ask

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,199
friends and family for s p advice and

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,800
also negotiate with others to protect

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
our privacy

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
so whether you call it social cyber

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,239
security or socio-technical cyber

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
security or community oversight or

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
network privacy or any number of other

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,040
names

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
these emergent perspectives on end user

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
s p beyond the individual share a common

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
goal to understand s p behaviors and

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,039
threats in an ecosystem of

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,600
interconnectedness and influence

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
so our methodology for taxonomizing the

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
social cyber security literature

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,760
landscape spans three phases one is

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
gathering private relevant prior work

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,399
two identifying common themes across

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,719
these papers and three grouping themes

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
and into taxonomically significant

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
significant domains

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
so first we began our search with some

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
keyword searches such as human and

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
societal aspects of security and privacy

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,759
and social aspects of security and

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,880
privacy

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
and these searches quickly snowballed to

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
include the terms above and these

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,880
keyword searches resulted in about a

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
thousand articles that mostly fell under

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
the umbrella of usable security and

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
privacy from the venues listed on this

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
slide

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
so to further pare down these papers

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
just to those that were specifically

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
including some element of social

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,520
coordination or cooperation we asked

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,079
questions like does this work advance

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,759
our knowledge of how

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,399
social groups uh jointly navigate s p

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,439
decisions behaviors threats or tools or

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,880
does this information advance our

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,439
knowledge of how s p threats tools or

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
advice affects groups differently than

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
individuals so for example work on

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
sharing passwords with others qualifies

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,799
as social cyber security since it

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,479
involves an element of negotiation and

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
trust in others

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
but work on general passive password

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
usage and usability does not so this

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,318
left us with approximately 100 articles

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,239
and then for each of the papers we

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,840
identified the core research question

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
methodology

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
analysis results results and etc and

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
then we applied a reflexive approach to

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,080
thematic analysis so i performed the

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
initial coding and i tagged these paper

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
summaries with granular codes like

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
dating or password sharing or location

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,560
etc and then our research team

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,239
participated in repeated discussions

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,080
together to iteratively organize these

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
codes and generate categories from these

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
codes

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
so across literature we identified four

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
main behavioral domains

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
one negotiating access to shared

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
resources which includes sharing media

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
accounts devices files physical access

83
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,080
to workspaces

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
rideshare houses etc

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
um shared in social authentication which

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
includes user reliance on others to help

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
them authenticate as well as systems

88
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
that facilitate group authentication

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
managing self-presentation which

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,080
includes disclosing personal info to

91
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
build trust self-censorship audience

92
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,480
selection tools context collapse and

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
curating public profiles

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
and finally influencing others s p

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
behaviors which includes consulting with

96
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
friends and family for advice sharing

97
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
experiences with others social proof

98
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
nudges to influence behaviors and

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
cross-cultural consideration for

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,720
appropriate s p advice

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,319
and then within each domain we also

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,159
looked at how these behaviors drift

103
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,760
differed across different levels of

104
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
social distance which was loosely

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,200
adapted from hull's proximity theory and

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,040
proxemics is the study of how people

107
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
non-verbally communicate their level of

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,239
intimacy with each other by arranging

109
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,519
each other within like a physical

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
environment so a hall identifies

111
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
basically forest spaces the intimate

112
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
space the personal space social space in

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,480
the public space

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
and these scales are just a generally

115
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
canonical reference for work on social

116
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
relationships and interpersonal

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,519
distances

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,280
and then within computing these scales

119
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
of course extend beyond physical

120
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
proximity

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
and then for s p behavior specifically

122
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,159
as we unpack in the slides to come the

123
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
ways that romantic partners families and

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
households social acquaintances and the

125
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
public share resources credentials

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
advice and about themselves with each

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
other are all distinct from one another

128
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
so let's move on to the meat of the sok

129
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,160
domains

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,759
in this section we consider the sharing

131
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,238
of digital services like netflix banking

132
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,600
work accounts

133
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
physical devices and physical

134
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
environments

135
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,080
so there's often a necessary conflation

136
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
between sharing content and sharing the

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,199
authentication information that

138
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,520
facilitates access to the content even

139
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
though passwords and pins generally come

140
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
with advice to never be shared

141
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
partners and households do so anyway via

142
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
granting access to devices media

143
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
finances etc cetera

144
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,840
so that's we include the majority of

145
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,440
password-sharing practices in this

146
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
domain

147
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
so within intimate relationships

148
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,040
partners share a variety of devices

149
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
accounts and resources bank accounts

150
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
media descriptions calendars like i

151
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
mentioned before

152
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
but these sharing practices also present

153
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
significant psychological hurdles

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
especially when the relationship ends

155
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
and within the context of intimate

156
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
partner violence or ipv these hurdles

157
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
grow due to the intimacy and in-person

158
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
nature of these relationships of users

159
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
can easily access the survivor's devices

160
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
and accounts

161
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
within family and households there's

162
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,440
actually a lot of similarity to intimate

163
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,680
relationships but more broadly there has

164
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
also been empirical work on how smart

165
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
home devices can unintendedly share

166
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,479
personal information with other

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,479
household members

168
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,000
within social acquaintances there has

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,680
been

170
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,520
participatory design work on encouraging

171
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,400
groups of users to envision social

172
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
solutions to the access and s p problems

173
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
they face as groups but more

174
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
specifically we find that people in the

175
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
workplace frequently share passwords

176
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
with co-workers via unofficial means

177
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,320
like slack email and post-it notes and

178
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,919
while there are technical systems in

179
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,600
place for access control such as like

180
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
key card access to physical maker spaces

181
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
or work environments these systems are

182
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,680
typically static and don't contain a lot

183
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
of nuance such as like if someone has to

184
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,919
access a space in an emergency

185
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
and then finally within the public

186
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,880
there is little social s p literature

187
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
actually but there are a few case

188
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,840
studies about tensions and trust and

189
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
privacy and car ride and accommodation

190
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
sharing with strangers

191
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
specifically there's been like evidence

192
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
of this negotiation of trust where users

193
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,520
want to know more about those who are

194
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
sharing resources with them even when

195
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
they're trying to hide as much info

196
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
about themselves as possible

197
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
and there as a result have also been a

198
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
few examples of work specifically trying

199
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,039
to anonymize writers and write your apps

200
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
and here you might notice that some of

201
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,759
these are highlighted and some of these

202
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,520
are not i'll go over what these mean

203
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
later on but just kind of keep them in

204
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
the back of your minds and like maybe

205
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,840
consider why they're different from the

206
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
others

207
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
so moving on to sheridan social

208
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,639
authentication we consider situations

209
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,000
where authentication credentials are

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,919
shared for purposes other than giving

211
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,240
access to a resource as well as systems

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,560
designed to support group authentication

213
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
so as previously mentioned sharing

214
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
passwords and sharing access to

215
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
resources are often complete conflated

216
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,039
but we didn't find specific literature

217
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,039
on joint or coordinated authentication

218
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
by couples

219
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,160
but within family and households there

220
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
has been some work done on users who

221
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
face accessibility challenges relying on

222
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
their family or close household members

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
to help them authenticate themselves

224
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
and these include people with visual

225
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
impairments those with language barriers

226
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,039
and users who have less technical

227
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,319
education who might share their

228
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
passwords and pins

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,360
not to actually share their financial

230
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
resources but because they face burdens

231
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,479
communicating or proving their

232
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
identities

233
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,000
and then in the workplace there has been

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
past work on the pitfalls of updating or

235
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
removing credentials so for example when

236
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
commonly shared passwords don't get

237
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
updated often enough people who leave

238
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,039
the company can have on

239
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,880
unauthorized access

240
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
and then in place of passwords

241
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
researchers have this tried to design

242
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,199
more like quote socially aware systems

243
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,960
for example there's trusted contacts on

244
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,039
facebook where users can rely on a

245
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
specific list of friends to help them

246
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,479
log in if they ever get locked out

247
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
in other examples employees shared

248
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,039
knowledge or secrets such as identifying

249
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,720
friends and photos to authenticate group

250
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
membership or secret knocking or tapping

251
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,960
patterns which are individually like

252
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
distinguishable since different people

253
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
knock in different ways

254
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,479
and then once again at the public scale

255
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
there are fewer examples of coordinated

256
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
authentication behaviors but we did find

257
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,919
work on nextdoor which is a neighborhood

258
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,160
oriented social media platform which

259
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,319
authenticates users a membership in a

260
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
physical community by either physically

261
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
mailing them a unique code or relying on

262
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
neighbors to vouch for them

263
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
and here again notice that there are a

264
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,639
few more use cases highlighted than than

265
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,280
in the previous section

266
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
managing self-representation refers to

267
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,279
the way that users share information

268
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
about themselves to their social circle

269
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
so this sharing unlike sharing resources

270
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
in the first domain specifically means

271
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,120
how users share their personal

272
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,559
information

273
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,519
so in

274
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,120
intimate relationships people hide

275
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
information about themselves because

276
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,839
they're embarrassed or worried about

277
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
doing something wrong but also to

278
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
share to establish trust in their

279
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
partners but ipv survivors actually face

280
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
pretty unique challenges so for example

281
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,399
when leaving an abusive situation

282
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
survivors might create profiles with

283
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,519
false information about themselves so

284
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,360
that their abusers can't find them

285
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,680
but they bear this burden themselves and

286
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,519
there aren't other like existing systems

287
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,839
to help them do this more naturally

288
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
within families and households most work

289
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,320
refers to how parents leak information

290
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
about their children online whether

291
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
through posting photos of their kids or

292
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
through surveillance apps that

293
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,720
themselves leak data to unknown third

294
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
parties

295
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
and then at the social level some users

296
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
manage interpersonal relationships as a

297
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
proxy for controlling who can see their

298
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
posts since context collapse means that

299
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
their direct control over these

300
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
audiences is diminished so for example

301
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
teens and younger adults use coded

302
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
language or self-censor themselves

303
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
online instead of like using existing

304
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
audience selection tools

305
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
and then conversely older adults are

306
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
less concerned with context collapse and

307
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
would prefer to like quote lock

308
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
everything down and like not post at all

309
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
about themselves but even adults adult

310
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,480
adopt habits from teens to signal

311
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,720
information about themselves for example

312
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
by checking into locations online or

313
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
sharing certain digital music playlists

314
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
to appear cooler to those around them

315
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
rather than like legitimately wanting

316
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
other people to hear their music

317
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
and finally within the public as users

318
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
conduct more of their lives online the

319
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
boundaries between intimate and public

320
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
relationships are increasingly fuzzy

321
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
of course in online dating users often

322
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
purposefully hide themselves from people

323
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
they know and are aware wary of

324
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,000
revealing about themselves even as they

325
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
extensively research potential partners

326
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
this hints at some sort of socially

327
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,480
expected public sharing but the extent

328
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
of this sharing is not super clear so

329
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
for example users on grindr feel

330
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
compelled to hide their hiv positive

331
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,040
status due to fear of stigmatization but

332
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,560
other users actually purposefully

333
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
disclose the status for the very same

334
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,839
reason

335
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,000
more broadly users make assumptions of

336
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
why others hide information about like

337
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
health status from the public and these

338
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,839
assumptions might pressure individuals

339
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
into revealing more about themselves

340
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,880
than they really want to and this

341
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
extends all the way to companies like

342
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
fitbit trying to nudge users into

343
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
sharing health data with insurance

344
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,959
companies

345
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,560
and finally of course there have been

346
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
end user tools that could help users

347
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
circumvent track tracking and obfuscate

348
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
their identities

349
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
tor of course is cooperative by design

350
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
and that like it requires volunteers to

351
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
run relays

352
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,399
but even though there have multiple

353
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,920
similarly cooperative tools developed

354
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
these tend to resist mainstream adoption

355
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
so there aren't like demonstrable

356
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,959
effects of like a

357
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
collective coordinated use

358
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
and once again please note that there is

359
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
not much highlighted out of all the

360
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
the cases i have mentioned

361
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
and this final domain advice and

362
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
influence covers how social groups can

363
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,200
influence each other's s p behaviors

364
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
so at the intimate level uh user

365
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
behaviors tend to mirror that of the

366
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,079
family household scale which i'll

367
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,480
discuss in a bit but in ipv scenarios

368
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,399
because abusers often control setup of

369
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,160
devices and households to surveil

370
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,680
survivors

371
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,360
survivors must seek advice from outside

372
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
of their relationship and they might go

373
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,800
to social workers or lawyers who might

374
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
not be best qualified to give them

375
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
advice

376
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
and this power and balance continues at

377
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
the household level where the most

378
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
knowledgeable or technically literate

379
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,880
member is going to be tasked with

380
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
setting up devices and networks and

381
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
giving out advice

382
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,320
and younger kids ask their parents for s

383
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,480
p advice and older adults in turn also

384
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
ask their adult children for advice

385
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,639
in both cases those being consulted

386
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
prefer more lock down modes

387
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
to s p that are intended to protect

388
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
those that are more vulnerable but also

389
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
kind of takes away their agency

390
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,279
and then at the social acquaintance

391
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,880
level there's been extensive evidence

392
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,240
that simply sharing stories and

393
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
experiences about s p with those around

394
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
you can instill a sense of camaraderie

395
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,519
and

396
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,079
social responsibility to protect and

397
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,000
learn more about them and observing

398
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
others positive behaviors has been found

399
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,200
to be the most frequent trigger of

400
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,470
change in smp behaviors

401
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,880
[Music]

402
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
and

403
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,480
i will actually try to wrap up more

404
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
quickly i guess

405
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,959
and then at the public scale there have

406
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,240
been a lot of papers exploring

407
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,720
demographic and cultural variations

408
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
um in how users approach ncp smp so

409
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
their differences across gender age

410
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
countries social economic status etc

411
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
and we i cover all these in the paper

412
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
and also other work has challenged the

413
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,040
portrayal of users as lazy or

414
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
unmotivated and adopting behaviors and

415
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,560
has instead called for more public

416
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
advice that specifically targets those

417
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,839
at risk

418
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
and finally please note that there are

419
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
like no highlighted use cases in this

420
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
behavior domain

421
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
so throughout all these domains i've

422
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,440
highlighted a few use cases and i will

423
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,279
discuss why they're actually highlighted

424
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,600
so in our sok we used ackerman's social

425
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
technical gap or the difference between

426
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
what users desire socially and what is

427
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,040
supported technically as a lens to

428
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,199
outline potential areas for future work

429
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,279
so this gap is extensively cited in

430
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
broader hci literature

431
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,839
to illustrate how technical systems may

432
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,199
fail to account for human social

433
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
behavior

434
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
so we developed three questions to

435
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
assess this gap across all the use cases

436
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
and then i'll go through each of them in

437
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,920
more detail

438
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
so for the first question

439
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
are there existing systems that help

440
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
facilitate this social use case

441
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,920
the answer is kind of of course like a

442
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
great deal of

443
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
behaviors and use cases involve some

444
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
sort of technical system but there's a

445
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
distinction between accident systems

446
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,600
that were worked around or modified to

447
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,079
fit social needs and novel systems

448
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,760
designed directly to facilitate these

449
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,199
behaviors

450
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
and as an example of the former is the

451
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,880
fact that while audience selection tools

452
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,120
exist on social media platforms teens

453
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
choose to use coded language instead to

454
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
reach their intended audience

455
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
and we also highlighted examples of the

456
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,000
latter throughout so for example the

457
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
social and uh shared authentication

458
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
domain we highlighted systems that

459
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
support group authentication by using

460
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
secret knocking patterns or shared

461
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,000
secrets

462
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
um we also highlighted tora as an

463
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
example that was social by design as

464
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
well as next doors authentication

465
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,880
methods but overall there are a few

466
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,360
examples of these novel s p systems that

467
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
require direct social interaction

468
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
specifically in the advice and influence

469
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
behavior domain

470
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
and on the second question can users fit

471
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
the affordances of existing smp systems

472
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,920
without altering their ideal social

473
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,360
behaviors short answer is no

474
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
many smp systems are designed to be

475
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
ignorant of social context and force

476
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
users to choose between security and

477
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,839
social accessibility

478
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,399
so like even in domains without direct

479
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,920
technical system oh sorry um

480
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
uh oh sorry uh even though like audience

481
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
selection tools like i mentioned exist

482
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,399
on social media platforms um teens like

483
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,880
choose actively not to use them

484
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
and even in domains without direct

485
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,079
technical system like influencing other

486
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,480
s p behaviors users are expected to

487
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,040
abide by institutionally set advice for

488
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
existing technologies

489
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,279
and finally the last question can users

490
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,279
use these existing systems as intended

491
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
to meet both their ideal social

492
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,199
behaviors and smp goals and once again

493
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
typically no so i'll go back to

494
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,560
passwords and personal devices again

495
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
they're not designed to be shared but

496
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,360
people do it anyway

497
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,399
and

498
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
since these devices and passwords fail

499
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,240
to account for human social behaviors

500
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
these systems no longer serve their

501
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
intended purpose

502
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
um and this shift and intent also means

503
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
that essence p s p preferences fall by

504
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,920
the wayside so like when a user shares

505
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,839
their netflix account their burden with

506
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,199
their making their private account

507
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
details visible and having personalized

508
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
recommendations being disrupted or

509
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,560
exposing their password to others

510
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
and like this may change how they use

511
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
the app entirely

512
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,040
and like production ready systems like

513
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,279
tor and like also track me not and ad

514
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,040
nauseum which and also employ

515
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
collectives for up obfuscation

516
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,480
um

517
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
exist um

518
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
uh but also like once again they're not

519
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
widely adopted

520
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,759
so to summarize across the majority of

521
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,000
social cyber security work there has

522
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
been extensive evidence that users might

523
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
must either modify their ideal social

524
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,920
behaviors to realize their s p

525
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
preferences or modify their id s p

526
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,759
preferences to reduce social friction

527
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,160
um so where do we go from here there's

528
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,600
been a lot of work that identifies the

529
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,800
social inadequacies of s p systems so in

530
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,639
that sense we see a need to design

531
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,279
systems with more social observability

532
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,599
cooperation and stewardship and we also

533
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,839
found little existing work theories or

534
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
systems or empirical or otherwise on the

535
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,919
public social scale

536
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,439
so we think that collective action

537
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
systems could be explored as a mechanism

538
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
for users to directly advocate for more

539
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
human-centered smp solutions

540
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
especially against things like web

541
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
tracking and surveillance technologies

542
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,039
rather than relying on experts to tell

543
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
them what's right

544
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,400
thank you and i'm happy to take any

545
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,290
questions now

546
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:38,149
[Applause]

547
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,799
thank you so much for your amazing talk

548
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
loved how you summarized all the

549
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,240
research that there ever was on this

550
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,640
topic in a couple of minutes um

551
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
before someone else can get a question

552
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,600
and um

553
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
so if someone wanted to actually you

554
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
know work in this field after reading

555
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,919
your paper uh where should they start

556
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,240
have you where were they like did you

557
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
find any like gaps and holes were like

558
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,919
huh i there should have been research on

559
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,679
this but there wasn't

560
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,039
um i think something that is like sticks

561
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,200
out most that's like most actionable

562
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,559
right now is like

563
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
uh ending account sharing so like for

564
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
example if you break up with someone um

565
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,720
and like you shared your netflix

566
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
password with them you kind of have to

567
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
either have an awkward conversation or

568
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,000
like secretly log them out and stuff um

569
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,280
and i'm sure there could be like better

570
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,120
ways to like design something like that

571
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,600
um and this also extends to things like

572
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
utility bills like people who used to

573
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
live in the same house as you or like

574
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
share other resources that it's like i

575
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
think those that's like a very

576
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
actionable domain

577
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
yeah

578
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,960
that that makes sense uh that's

579
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
interesting um

580
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,280
from a uh

581
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
i want to say like from a threat

582
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
perspective uh would you would you say

583
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
the um

584
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
the majority of like what you were

585
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,880
looking at was more like um

586
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,400
this is terrible this is terrible or

587
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
would you say it's more like from a

588
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,679
usability perspective or more from a

589
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,760
this is impractical but it's not

590
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
terrible perspective

591
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
what's like your overall assessment of

592
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,120
where we are

593
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,000
um

594
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
i guess like

595
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,679
uh my overall assessment is like

596
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,559
everything is not like super ideal like

597
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,080
users can

598
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
eventually get to the things they want

599
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,200
um

600
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,039
say like just to use the password

601
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,720
sharing example again like

602
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
um

603
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
they can eventually just like change

604
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
their password or like have an awkward

605
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,760
conversation with their ex or whatever

606
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,320
um but like that's not like ideal like

607
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
that could be avoided if there are like

608
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,600
better ways to like technically support

609
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
that

610
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
thank you thank you for this assessment

611
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,919
does anyone else have a question in this

612
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,160
room

613
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,440
all right it doesn't look like it thank

614
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,360
you again for your talk

615
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,678
and your paper
