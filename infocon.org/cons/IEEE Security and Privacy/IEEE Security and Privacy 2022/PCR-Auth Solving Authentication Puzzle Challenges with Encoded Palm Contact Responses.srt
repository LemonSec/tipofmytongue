00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,240
hi everybody

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,640
i'm lon huang from asu

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,240
today i will introduce our pcros solving

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,559
authentication power challenge with the

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,880
encoded pump contact response

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
the authors are me and my advisor dr

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,199
chanwang

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,000
biometrics such as faces fingerprints

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
and erases have been widely deployed to

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,560
verify users however

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
due to the increasingly advanced

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,880
recording technologies 3d printing

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,719
wireless ear shopping and malware

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,440
the uterus biometrics under two major

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
replace threats

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
which are the physical forgeries and

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,879
authentication data

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,760
use

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,840
addressing the replay issues has become

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,760
a critical task for ensuring the

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
biometric security

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,960
and one solution is live lease detection

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
which requires motions to prove the live

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,000
faces or leverages heat maps to detect

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
live fingers

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
while these methods are required the

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,680
user's participation were

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,720
subject to additional sensor overheads

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,799
and to further address the data replay

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,200
issues behavioral biometrics are

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
integrated with the change response

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
protocols

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
specifically the user is required to

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,960
respond to a random challenge for

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,240
authentication

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
by tapping speaking or eye tracking

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
however existing biometric change

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
response solutions or require active

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,720
participation from the user which are

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
both time consuming and

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
intrusive

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
instead

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
this work aims to develop a biometric

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
based change authentication or synthesis

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,560
system for the handheld devices which

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
not only solves the replay issues but

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,000
also

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
requires no human efforts

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
and we propose to leverage acoustic

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
signals to interact with the gripping

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,320
hand to capture biometric features after

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
being generated at the speaker

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
a portion of the steamer's signals goes

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,479
to a direct path to reach the smartphone

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,680
microphone

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
and in addition

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,759
some signals go through more complicated

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
reflective paths

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
and the speaker sound induced the device

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,360
surface to vibrate

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
which further creates the sound at the

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,720
same frequencies and also the harmonics

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
and

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
as a result the signals received at the

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
microphone

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
contains three major components which

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
are the direct pass sound the reflection

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
sound and the surface vibration sound

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
when the user holds a mobile device by

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,760
hand

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,519
the contact inpump on the device surface

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
i would exert the interference on all

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
the three uh singular components in form

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,519
of absorption

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
reflection damping and refraction

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
and the secret equation explains how the

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
three signal components

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
are influenced by the

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
uterus contacting pump regarding both

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
the amplitude and the phase

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
and we then define the palm contact

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,480
response which is the pcr

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
describing the gripping head biometric

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
with three signal components regarding

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
the signal frequency

86
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,879
and due to the euro's distinctive

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,200
physiological pump characteristics such

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
as the hand geometry as well as the

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,000
behavioral characteristics such as the

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
graphic

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,519
the same speaker sound will result in

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,959
different

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,519
sound at the microphone corresponding to

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
different pumps

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
to choose the feasibility we play a

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
short sharp signal using a smartphone

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,519
speaker

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,120
the right figure

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
shows the received signal that the

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
microphone

101
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
when the smartphone is held in the

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
user's hand or placed on the table

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
and from the comparison we observe that

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
your scripting hand

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,799
suppresses the speaker sound by average

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,480
of 3 db

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,959
moreover when the chirp signal spread

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,159
switched from the 18k to 22khz the

109
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,080
signal amplitudes are degraded with

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
different scales

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
and furthermore we found while the

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,319
direct pass signal sound dominate the

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,239
first 25 milliseconds

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,560
the reflected sound and the device

115
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,799
vibration sounds became significant

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
after the speaker sound stops

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
and we then study the feasibility of

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,720
using pcrs to distinguish users

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
this figure shows the spectrogram of the

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,199
received chirp signals when two users

121
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,520
grab the same smartphone twice

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
and it is evident that the time

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
frequency images are consistent for the

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
same user but are distinctive among

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,520
different users

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
and specifically not only the dominate

127
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
direct pass signal but also the sound's

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
affiliated shows distinctive patterns

129
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
among the two different users

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
the results indicate that we can

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
leverage the temporal and frequency

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
information to achieve robust user

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
authentication

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
we now present the chain response model

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
the pcr encoder is created for each user

136
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
which is pre-trained with all of the

137
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
uterus handgrip biometric features

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
and when the user sends their

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,039
authentication requests pcrl generates a

140
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,120
one-time challenge

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
and the handheld devices place a

142
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,120
one-time challenge in coded stimulus

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,919
signals using the smartphone speaker and

144
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
in meanwhile its microphones record the

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
signals to obtain the encoded pcr

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,919
next the pcr supplies the pcr decoder to

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
verify the code and make the

148
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,599
authentication decision

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
and we then introduce the flow of our

150
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
system

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
upon each authentication request

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
the pcr encoder first detects whether

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
the device is under intentional

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,479
ultrasonic interference

155
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,120
if not the pcr encoder generates a

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
one-time challenge

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
and selects the ultrasonic processing

158
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
accordingly to encode the user's head

159
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,320
grip biometric into a pcr code the

160
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
microphone data is the input of the pcr

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
decoder

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
after being pre-processed the data is

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
failing to the channel filtering based

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
pcr code extraction to pick up the pcr

165
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
digits from the audio

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
and in procur particular we derive the

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,919
spectrogram to capture the pcr code in

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,240
both time and frequency domains

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
and the one-time change control channel

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
filter sits on cutoff frequency to

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
extract each pcr digit

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,520
the obtained pcr digits are then sent to

173
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
the cm-based pcr decoder for

174
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
verification where the same scores are

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
returned

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
and we further develop a cluster-based

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
method to verify the pcr code by

178
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
integrating the same scores as well as

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,720
the snr so of all the pcr digits which

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,639
examines both the user's biometric

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,600
features and the coding sequence

182
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,759
the access permission is granted only

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
when the pcr code successfully recovered

184
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,960
the one-time challenge

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
for the pcr encoder we designed the

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,919
stimulus signals to be a number of 25

187
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
milliseconds long and 350 hertz wide

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,840
share process within the range of 17k to

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
22khz we select 10 exclusive layer band

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
channels from this ring to represent

191
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,240
decimal digits

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
and the bottom two figures illustrate

193
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
the stimulus signals for encoding a four

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
digit pcr code

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
where as many as 10 to the fourth power

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,719
pcr codes can be generated

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,120
the raw audio data is first

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,639
pre-processed

199
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,080
and the bandpass filter with the

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
passband 17k to 22khz is used to remove

201
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
the noises outside of the stimulus

202
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
singles frequency range

203
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
and synchronization is being performed

204
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,199
by leveraging the evenly spaced chair

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
process

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
and because each pcr digit is encoded

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
onto one of the predefined channels we

208
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
use the bandpass filter to extract each

209
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,400
pcr digit by scoping down the

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
corresponding channel

211
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,800
we then derive the spectrogram of each

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
pcr as the biometric features to

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
describe the pcr in both time and

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,879
frequency domains

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,120
in order to balance the spectrogram

216
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
resolution and also the decoding

217
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,400
algorithm complexity we divide each pcr

218
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,639
spectrogram into three pieces

219
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,120
which separately describe the different

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,039
stages of the pcr

221
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
and specifically the first special gram

222
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,479
many captures submit the pump's impact

223
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
on the direct pass signal

224
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
while the second and the third focus on

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
the reflective signals and the induced

226
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,960
surface vibration sounds

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,120
we use cn to distinguish people's hands

228
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,960
from each pcr digit

229
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
the spectrogram of each pcr digit is

230
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
taken at the input and the output of the

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
same scores which are basically the user

232
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
and angular probabilities

233
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,640
since each pcr is divided into three

234
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,399
consecutive pieces

235
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,880
and each smartphone has two microphone

236
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,839
channels a pcr digit can be decoded into

237
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
12 second scores

238
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
and next we develop a cluster-based

239
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,279
method to verify the pcr code by

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
integrating the biometric features as

241
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
well as the coding features

242
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
the proposed clustering algorithm

243
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,200
explores the relationships between the

244
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
pcr digits

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
rather than treating each

246
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
digit alone

247
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,519
this figure illustrates the 2d

248
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,760
clustering results we observed that the

249
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
uterus cluster is clearly separated from

250
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
other uterus the fixed silicon hand and

251
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,320
different replay attacks

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
for the experiment we explore we

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
experiment with six different mobile

254
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,720
device models which all have two

255
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
microphones invaded

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
and we recruit 40 participants and

257
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
collect the data in two sessions at

258
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,600
different dates

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
with the first session be used for

260
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
training and the second for testing

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,839
and in each session the participant is

262
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,360
asked to re-grab the phone from the

263
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
table 40 times in order to include the

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,040
behavioral inconsistency

265
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,399
this table presents the overall

266
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
performance of the selected channels

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
when microphone 1 microphone 2 or both

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
microphones of a samsung s8 phone is

269
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,959
used

270
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,200
we found that the 40 participants pcrs

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
are distinguished clearly on the 10

272
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,680
channels achieving an average of 91

273
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
accuracy when two microphones are used

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
we thus choose the 10 channels for

275
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,880
decimal encoding

276
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
we now present the performance of pcros

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
with different code lengths and compare

278
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
it with the naive decoder which trades

279
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
each pcr digit along

280
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
the left figure shows the user

281
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
verification accuracy

282
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
when one to six digit pcr codes are used

283
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
respectively

284
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
we can observe that when using longer

285
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
pcr codes the performance of the live

286
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
decoder decreases drastically because it

287
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
requires all the pcr digits to pass the

288
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
verification

289
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,360
while the accuracy of our cluster-based

290
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,839
pcr decoder

291
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,600
increases and the roc curves of the four

292
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,279
and six digit

293
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,120
pcr codes in the right figure further

294
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
confirmed the high performance of pcrs

295
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
we then studied our system performance

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
under noise

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
including daily noise as well as the

298
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,320
dedicated ultrasonic noise

299
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
which are all measured by the ultrasound

300
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
pressure level

301
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
the figure on the left shows our system

302
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
works well under these noises

303
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,160
where a 60 gpcr code can still achieve a

304
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,959
93 percent accuracy under a 50 db

305
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,600
ultrasonic noise we thus choose the 50

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
db at the threshold to detect the denial

307
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
of service attack before running the

308
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
authentication

309
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,839
and it is important to note that some

310
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
pressure levels of daily noises are

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,640
always under 30 db in the ultrasonic

312
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,519
band

313
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
which means our system generally works

314
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
for most scenarios

315
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
and figure on the right compares the

316
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
performance of our system with the

317
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
traditional method without coding under

318
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,760
the side channel replay and the software

319
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,920
software level replay attack

320
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
we found that without coding the

321
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
traditional biometric method suffers

322
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,519
from 87 percent for success rate

323
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,440
even encoding the biometric with a

324
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
single decimal digit could reduce the

325
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,279
far by a factor of 10.

326
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,639
we further consider two new types of

327
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
synthesis attack where the adversary

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
listens to each coding curve during the

329
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
authentication and simultaneously sends

330
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
the corresponding militia signal to

331
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
launch attack

332
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
we first simulate the synchronization

333
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,639
disturbance attack by replaying the

334
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,760
uterus pcr digits with double nominees

335
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
which postpone the entire

336
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
synchronization to pick up adversarial

337
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
digits

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,160
the figure on the right shows the system

339
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,639
performance under this type of attack

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
as the attacker has to listen and then

341
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,160
attack

342
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
the delay is unavoidable we thus

343
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
consider the entire adversary pcr code

344
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
sent with different delays

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
we observed that when the attack data

346
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
are included in training the fdr is over

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,079
6 ddpcr 4 to 0 for all cases

348
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
we then simulate the adversary

349
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
perturbation attack by using the

350
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,519
perturbation noises to modify the

351
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
original speaker into the user's pcr

352
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,959
digit

353
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
due to the delay

354
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
the attacking sound can only modify

355
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,800
partial frequencies the attack has two

356
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,120
cases depending on whether the

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
perturbations are synchronized well with

358
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,680
the speaker sound as illustrated by the

359
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
left two figures

360
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
and the figure on the right shows the

361
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
system performance under this type of

362
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,160
attack

363
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
where different synchronization errors

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
are considered

365
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
we can observe that when the attack data

366
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
is included in training the 6d pcr code

367
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,399
can also achieve the zero percent far

368
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,200
for all cases

369
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
and to summarize

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
we proposed a solution to address the

371
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,959
replay issues of biometric

372
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,360
authentications by integrating a coding

373
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,560
technique with biometric acquisition

374
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,240
we extract the uterus hand grid

375
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
biometrics while acoustic sensing which

376
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,120
is a combination of the theological and

377
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,199
the behavioral biometrics of the user

378
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,040
scraping hand

379
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,199
we encode the uterus biometric into

380
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,959
biometric codes

381
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,880
and develop the same base algorithm to

382
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
decode the unique biometric code

383
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,680
we also investigate the new attacks by

384
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,839
assuming the adversary can repeat the

385
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
code replicate the biometric or forge

386
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
both

387
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
and thanks for listening please feel

388
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,120
free to ask any questions

389
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,079
thanks the thanks for the talk long so

390
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,880
there is a question from hoping by

391
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
daming young how does pcr handle those

392
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
devices having built in eco cancellation

393
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,079
uh design which discard the echo of some

394
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,800
stimulus signals does pcr heart require

395
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,320
specific type of devices yeah actually

396
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,800
we have now tested the device with eco

397
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
cancellation but

398
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
as

399
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,839
to my knowledge

400
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,560
the echo chemical solution is mainly

401
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,519
designed for the audible band but our

402
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,279
system using the ultrasonic sound so

403
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,680
we will try to test those devices maybe

404
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
our ultrasound would pass the their

405
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,760
cancellation algorithm

406
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,279
so there's a question on the mic let's

407
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,399
go ahead

408
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
hi this is uh

409
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,800
from purdue university it's a nice talk

410
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
so my question is uh does your system

411
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,880
require the user to hold the phone in a

412
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
specific way like

413
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
sometimes i hold my phone with my left

414
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
hand and sometimes i hold my phone with

415
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,959
my right hand or sometimes i hold my

416
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,880
phone with both hands does that affect

417
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,279
the system yeah actually it's a very

418
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,800
good question

419
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
so if the user wants to use both hands

420
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
he has to train the

421
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,759
train the

422
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,959
both hand to our model and in order to

423
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,600
include the behavioral inconsistency

424
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,240
which you said that users could hold the

425
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
phone in different postures

426
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,120
we just

427
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
collect the data like

428
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
by asking the user to re-grab the phone

429
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,920
from the table 40 times and in that way

430
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
the user could uh

431
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,360
like

432
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
there could be differences when the user

433
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
re-grabbed the phone so

434
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
by doing that we

435
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,320
include the behavior inconsistency and

436
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
for some other scenarios like if you are

437
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
sitting or lying down

438
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,759
that may need more training data for

439
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,240
to make the system work

440
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,519
great thank you you're

441
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
uh alex young in red balloon security so

442
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
i was just curious so you've mentioned

443
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
as one of the factors affecting the

444
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
sound this amount of fat so i was kind

445
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,839
of curious

446
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,720
do you have a sense of how much it might

447
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
get confused by users gaining you're

448
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
losing weight

449
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,920
uh

450
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
uh i i didn't quite get that can you

451
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
repeat that you you mentioned that this

452
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,920
the kind of the the um shape of the

453
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
reflected sound is among the fractures

454
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
is amount of fat in the hand

455
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,800
yeah so if the user loses weight or

456
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
gains weight and when there is now more

457
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,760
fat or less fat do you have a sense how

458
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,079
whatever problem that might be yeah yeah

459
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,799
that's also a very interesting question

460
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,919
so

461
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,959
so if the user loses weight uh i mean

462
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
the half size or the

463
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,160
the fat in the hand may just change so

464
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
in order to do uh

465
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
by

466
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
solving that problem we may need the

467
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,959
user to

468
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,280
like retrain the model

469
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,720
like for a period of time like or

470
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
another solution is

471
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
if we already know the user's

472
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,559
biometric um i mean if we already know

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,280
the user already login to the system log

474
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,200
into the smartphone

475
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,880
and we can

476
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,919
uh we know the identity of the user we

477
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
but in this period we can just launch

478
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,200
the training process to update the model

479
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,039
to gain the user's most recent

480
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,120
hand grip biometrics thanks your

481
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
that would be like a password change you

482
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,720
change your biometric uh with over time

483
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,120
uh you mean it will be like a password

484
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,799
change like you log into your system and

485
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,320
then you change your password here in

486
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,880
this case you retrain the model so yeah

487
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
with the new hand

488
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,200
so one question i had about in your

489
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
slide 14 where you show these different

490
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
clusters

491
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,280
it's i might have looked at incorrectly

492
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,039
but it seems like the fake hand and the

493
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,240
other person's uh points are overlapping

494
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,760
so i'm just wondering like yeah fake

495
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,400
hand is applicable for some people it

496
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,360
can be

497
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,320
yeah

498
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
since the fake hand we use is a fixed

499
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
silicon handle which is very similar to

500
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
a real human's hand so that's why the

501
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,400
cluster of the fixed side is very close

502
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,799
to the other user's hand

503
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,240
so

504
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,280
i mean the thick hand shape and also

505
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
the size is very close to

506
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,799
to human head

507
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,400
and can you speak a little bit about

508
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
this registration process or like what

509
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
the how much time does it take what the

510
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,919
user has to do and do you need like

511
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,280
additional device or everything can be

512
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
done on a mobile phone for for during

513
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,400
registration yeah so for a specific

514
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,960
