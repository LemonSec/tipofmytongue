1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,920
now it's working yeah thanks for the

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
introduction sasha welcome everyone to

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,680
the presentation of our paper how does

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,759
usable security not end up in software

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,800
products

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,559
this is my colleague marco goodflash my

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,559
name is jan klemmer and together we are

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,080
presenting joint work with our core

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,880
authors nicholas busch yasmina ja angela

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,600
zasa and zashafar

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
let's start with the first look on some

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
motivating examples of our work

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
and one thing we see and i think that's

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
a common problem is that cryptography is

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
often hard to use and one of the best

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
examples and probably one of the oldest

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,399
ones is

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,760
secure email and encrypted email and we

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,360
know at least for 20 years since the

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,840
seminal paper by written at tiger that

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,760
pgp has several

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,840
usable security problems

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,719
and even today if we look about what the

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,559
adoption of secure and encrypted email

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,000
is

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,079
my colleague chris outlined it in his

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,280
talk it's only about

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,359
0.0.6 percent of encrypted email and

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
what we can conclude from this is that

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,359
if we have a security mechanism that is

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,159
hard to use we only see that there's a

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,400
very poor or low adoption

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,159
another great example are passwords and

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,320
their related challenges

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,119
so

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,040
we also know that passwords might be

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
very secure if chosen and handled

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
correctly but in the end we know there

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
are problems like reusing passwords

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,640
pinning them on a monitor and writing

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,360
them in a post-it or simply choosing to

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,520
short or easily guessable passwords and

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,759
again that shows that human factors

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,720
somehow impact security

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
this and other examples also from

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
research show that if we want to achieve

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
effective security in the end we do not

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
need to only consider security alone but

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,439
also usability and human factors

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,360
and while there is actually lots of

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
research and our community gained many

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
insights especially on end user usable

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,600
security

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,079
we think there is some problem and maybe

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
some yeah lack of usable security

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
knowledge in the industry because we see

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
many software products that still have

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
yeah let's say much room for improvement

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
regarding usable security and might have

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,120
severe issues in that area

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
and this brings us to what we did in our

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
paper

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
so for us we think it's somehow unclear

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
whether companies and their software

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
teams take care of usable security if

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,640
they know what usable security is at all

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
and how their processes for usable

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,440
security look in the wild

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,959
and in this paper we answered the

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,200
research question which factors in the

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
software development process and in the

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,160
company's influence usable security what

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
are contributors and blockers for usable

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,840
security in the software development and

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
third when and where in the software

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
development process are important

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
decisions made that influence usable

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
security

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,519
to answer and explore these research

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
questions

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
we somehow needed to get insights into

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
industry and the software development

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,319
teams

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
and therefore we decided to conduct

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,159
interviews and in the end we conducted

86
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
25 semi-structured 90-minute interviews

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
with important stakeholders from the

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
software development process so on the

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
one hand obviously this includes

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
developers

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
but it was a very diverse set so we also

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
talked to manager and sea level roles

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,000
and also

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
guys more from the usability side so for

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
example ux experts

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
and also in terms of the companies it

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
was very diverse so from very small

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
companies to very big companies with

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
more than 5 000 employees working in

100
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,760
different industry branches for example

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
on security products like password

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,400
managers but also other things like

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,200
variables or automotive

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
we recruited the 25 participants on

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
various channels so

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
one thing was our professional networks

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
and uh freelancers from upwork we uh

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
yeah that we are the

109
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,840
most common recruitment channel but we

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,159
also had some participants through um

111
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
social media advertisements

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,280
and

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,200
every participant then had to fill a

114
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,280
pre-questionnaire which handled getting

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,439
content gathering some demographic

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,000
information and especially also some

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,599
background on their

118
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
security and usability

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
experience to prepare and

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
yeah save time in the interview in the

121
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
end

122
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
the actual interview started with some

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,919
warm-up questions and some individual

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
questions that

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,639
yeah

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,880
got us more about the background of the

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,199
participant and then in the actual main

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,919
part of the interview we try to focus on

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,919
an example from the participants

130
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,639
professional career and we split our

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
sections

132
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
five sections

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
in the interview guide so

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
we tried to reconstruct somehow the

135
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
software development process and

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
therefore we started basically with the

137
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
first section

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
we called the communication phase so

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,639
that includes basically requirements

140
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
engineering and gathering and then going

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,479
on through a modeling phase a planning

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
phase contract and construction phase

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
which actually handles the

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
implementation and ending with the

145
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
deployment phase

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,919
and

147
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,400
in each interview we did this in two

148
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
sections so first we

149
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,880
did all these five sections for

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,080
usability with a deep focus on usability

151
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
and then in a separate

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
section in the same interview also for

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
security to focus on both and depth

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,440
before we then in the end focused on

155
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,280
yeah the intersection of both which is

156
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
usable security and ask some specific

157
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
questions on that

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
so more details on that especially on

159
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,639
coding are

160
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,479
in the paper but this is just the

161
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
overview and with that i would like to

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,039
head over to marco for the results

163
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,560
okay thank you

164
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
so um let's start with the results

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,479
we basically analyzed those

166
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
software teams in terms of whether they

167
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
were able to

168
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,479
to understand what usability means in

169
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,840
terms of security whether they were

170
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,960
aware of usable security and also we

171
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,360
analyzed them what kind of user standard

172
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
methods did they perform like do they do

173
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
proper user

174
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
research at the beginning do they do any

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,919
kind of usability evaluation at the end

176
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
and we came up with those four

177
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,199
categories

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
give me an example here um

179
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,880
for example this quadrant here um you

180
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
could see that we found five companies

181
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
which were a rare feasible security

182
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,880
which also did proper user research or

183
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,759
like which processes were characterized

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,880
by user centered methods

185
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
and in this for example um they weren't

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
aware of use both the qt's the majority

187
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
of all companies um we investigated here

188
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,440
and they also prefer they really had the

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
lack and users android methods

190
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,599
i will guide you to through those

191
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
categories now

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
um let's have a look on that

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
okay is the first one on the table you

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,840
see for example the kind of product the

195
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
teams

196
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
worked on you also see the company side

197
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
and whether they were aware or like

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
whether they have uh use of hundred

199
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
measures within their processes

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
so we saw a lot of misconceptions there

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
about usable security and what we also

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
experienced within this category was

203
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
that

204
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,039
usability or

205
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,680
ux experts were really rarely involved

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
if at all

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
in the next one we also

208
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
found two companies which

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
did pretty well in terms of usability

210
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,599
but security was of lower priority

211
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
priority for them so even one

212
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
participant described that they

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
specifically decrease the security to

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
increase the usability and that is kind

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
of a usability trait of what we saw here

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
and this is indeed also a misconception

217
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,680
because this is way more complex than

218
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,759
just trading usability against security

219
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,879
or vice versa

220
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,000
the next

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
group here is this is actually the group

222
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,879
which performed best from all we found

223
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,840
here

224
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,120
so for example um the

225
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
um the

226
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,720
participant which reported us about the

227
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,599
password manager explained that they had

228
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
indeed usable security as part of the

229
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
business goals yes the password manager

230
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
indeed solves a huge usable security

231
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,759
problem

232
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,800
and

233
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
we also thought that there was a lot of

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,879
um

235
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
active user feedback gathering so most

236
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,200
of the product teams they had um

237
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
dedicated so they actively gathered

238
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
feedback from their communities

239
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,039
and we also saw there that there was at

240
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
least one person who tried to build the

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
gap at the bridge between the usability

242
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,279
people and the security people

243
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
the next group that was also really

244
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,560
interesting because um we found six

245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,160
companies uh within this category

246
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,959
and five of them were specifically um

247
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
focused on security and they were all

248
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,839
aware of usable security that usability

249
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,880
is important for security

250
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
but

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
only one company had an actively

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,920
involved designer within the processes

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
and also

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
they did not perform um

255
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
well user-friendly methods in the

256
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
process they were they really had a lack

257
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,399
of in that in their processes

258
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
and even one uh when

259
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
participant described it that they were

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
looking for a ux designer with a

261
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
security background and as they didn't

262
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,200
found anyone they just continued as they

263
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,440
usually did

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
so um let me now conclude this a little

265
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,560
bit and give you the most important

266
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
things which we found out that

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
blocks usable security or that

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
contributes usable acuity but for more

269
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
details i would recommend you to just

270
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
have a look at the paper because there

271
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
are more factors

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
so we start with the first one here

273
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
limited resources we saw

274
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,399
we got quite a lot um the answer like

275
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,800
we don't have time for anything um we

276
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
don't have budget for that so we don't

277
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,200
have budget for security or usability

278
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,279
and also a lot of people told us that

279
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
they like had really pressure to develop

280
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
features and record this like the

281
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,599
functionality first attitude

282
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
the next point here i also explained

283
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,200
this

284
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,959
a couple of minutes ago

285
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,200
we found a lot of misconceptions about

286
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
usable security what this actually is

287
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,240
and even we got participants which

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
described us that if the technology is

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
not used correctly it's definitely the

290
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
users for it and they were really

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
blaming the users for that

292
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,600
but we also

293
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,720
experienced that usability is indeed

294
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
sometimes not taken seriously we saw

295
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,680
this as we had a lot of requirement

296
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
specification in terms of security but

297
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
when it comes to usability it was more

298
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
like yeah yeah we were just doing this

299
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,519
so it was not often specified within the

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
initial requirement phase

301
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,880
a next point here um we saw also that i

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,040
already told like designers or ux

303
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
experts were really involved valley and

304
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,240
we also got direct statements from our

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
participants that

306
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
there wasn't

307
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,959
there weren't either sure whether the

308
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
designer in that case was able to grab

309
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
the fronted engineer in terms of

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
security

311
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
so that really kind of a communication

312
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
barrier

313
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
and now let's come to the things which

314
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,040
we um

315
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
figured out to be contributing towards

316
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
usable security and um

317
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
for example we saw that there was at

318
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
least one per in the context which did

319
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
well there was at least one person

320
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
which actively tried to build the gap to

321
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
close the gap between usability people

322
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
and security people and that does not

323
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
necessarily have to be like a usable

324
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
security champion which may have equal

325
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
domain knowledge on the security or

326
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,399
usability side we quite often saw cases

327
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,480
where we had like security people who

328
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
knew a little bit about usability or

329
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,480
vice versa

330
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
and even one participant described that

331
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,959
he he involved his design team in threat

332
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,800
modeling activities with the security

333
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
team

334
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,240
the next thing of course if we think of

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
the password manager example they had

336
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,000
definitely a commitment towards

337
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
usability

338
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,600
and

339
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
sometimes we also experience that

340
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
usability was indeed

341
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
demanded by the company lead or its

342
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,959
customers

343
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
the next thing here of course

344
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
like software teams have to be aware

345
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
about usable security and they also

346
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
need to have at least a little bit of

347
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
knowledge what they can do to improve

348
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
the product's usability

349
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
okay let's come to some takeaways to

350
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,519
conclude here a little bit so um we have

351
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,480
seen that several factors impact user

352
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,240
both security

353
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
and also that decisions are made at

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
different stages by different

355
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
stakeholders in the software development

356
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,519
process so this is not only about

357
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,279
developers

358
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
and we also have theme that this topic

359
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,360
is also interdisciplinary in practice

360
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,639
so um what could we recommend people in

361
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,279
industry so first of all like try to

362
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
figure out whether people are aware of

363
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,680
usable security if not create awareness

364
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
try to strengthen the communication

365
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
among subject matter experts so like

366
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,560
maybe security people or usability

367
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
people

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,399
try to do everything quite early in the

369
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,839
process so please do not just

370
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,600
stick at the end and do only usability

371
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
evaluation try to do this early measure

372
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,760
and track your activities um you're

373
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
trying to integrate and you're trying to

374
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
adapt

375
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
and

376
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
last message here may be usable usable

377
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
for qt champions may be helpful but rare

378
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
and we have seen that it also work for

379
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,079
the companies when you have people who

380
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
have either domain knowledge on one of

381
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
the sites

382
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
so for research um we have seen

383
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
so what does it mean for research we

384
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,160
have seen that there is quite a huge

385
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
knowledge gap between industry and

386
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
academia

387
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
um so like we're just at the point where

388
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
people are not aware of what usable

389
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,920
security is

390
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
and we have also

391
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,920
seen that we need kind of a holistic

392
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
view on the software development process

393
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
because it is not only about developers

394
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
their decisions made at different

395
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
stages

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
and

397
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,480
we also have seen that we have teams

398
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,639
which have really have a lot of pressure

399
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,880
which really pressed to

400
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,279
produce features and we can't demand

401
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
from them to just change all the

402
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,160
processes from today to tomorrow so we

403
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
also need uh

404
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
lightweight um

405
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
measures that we also could help them

406
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
like maybe secure defaults or any kind

407
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
of tooling which they could easily

408
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,839
integrate

409
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,920
so and with that

410
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
thank you for listening and we're up for

411
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,900
christians

412
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:27,360
[Applause]

413
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
all right do we have questions

414
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
i think like they may you come to the

415
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,920
microphone oh yeah

416
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,959
yeah so do you know if there is any

417
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,440
government in any country or any agency

418
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
that has identified this problem and

419
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
that has given recommendations or

420
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,519
may try to

421
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
have some standard for the companies to

422
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,160
follow to solve this problem

423
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,639
at least what so what we've experienced

424
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,680
in our cases that

425
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
we have we found a lot of requirements

426
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
in terms of security but the specific

427
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,160
crypto standard has to be used that pen

428
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
test has to perform stuff like that but

429
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,399
what we haven't seen

430
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,199
is like specific requirement for usable

431
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,680
security so like in any case that you

432
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,839
that software has to be tested and we

433
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
can test if

434
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,839
if users can use it or not that is what

435
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
our research is about we can test this

436
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
and that's something we did not found in

437
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,360
that that extent there

438
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,199
so

439
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,160
okay thanks

440
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
hi this is naman from wisconsin uh did

441
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,279
you find any key differences in open

442
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,040
source software versus

443
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
private software

444
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
oh yes i think we had um

445
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,199
let me think one or two open source

446
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,480
projects

447
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
so um

448
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,279
it's just like

449
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
maybe this is more like a feeling right

450
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,440
now but um

451
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,319
in so they really had communities in the

452
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,480
in the one open source project which

453
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
they talked about they had really a

454
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,199
community where they tried to get

455
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,119
feedback but also um they had also not

456
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
really involved our

457
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,400
design team there

458
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
so um

459
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,319
it was also mainly driven by one

460
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,240
development team

461
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,640
thank you

462
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
hi chris anasia carnegie mellon um

463
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
did you

464
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
record anything say for more traditional

465
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
like waterfall

466
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
based development approaches versus

467
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,600
devops-based development approaches and

468
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,320
how that impacts how usable security

469
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,840
integrates into the software development

470
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,679
process

471
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,840
oh that's a nice question

472
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
um so

473
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
just um to give you some information so

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
we mainly had agile teams

475
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
so i think we had one or two companies

476
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,080
who did waterfall in software

477
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
development

478
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
so and if i remember correctly

479
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,480
there's like

480
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
i think the loop of feedback within the

481
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,840
waterfall was less

482
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
effective i would say like you know you

483
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,640
just do it once and then it's developed

484
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,880
and the kind of user feedback which we

485
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
saw on those companies which did pretty

486
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,480
well in this five context

487
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,559
they really tried to get in the feedback

488
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,480
and there was something which was

489
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
lacking a little bit i would say in the

490
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,960
one waterfall case we had um doing the

491
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
interviews

492
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
so i mean so one of the comments you

493
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
made was there's a lot of pressure for

494
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
feature development right where because

495
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,559
i mean this almost feels like a case

496
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,360
where

497
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,440
the feature development is driven harder

498
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,880
in agile in in devops and whereas you

499
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,760
know

500
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,280
you don't get your product out as fast

501
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,120
or maybe even the product that you want

502
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,480
with waterfall but you could probably

503
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
get the usable security in and i'm

504
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,799
wondering how you would give advice to

505
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,760
um

506
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
you know for the companies to kind of

507
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,320
adjust between the two and get the

508
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
feedback they want in usable security

509
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,880
in the development process between the

510
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,000
two models

511
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
so i mean like what could we recommend

512
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
to people who like do waterfall

513
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
development well in both processes right

514
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,200
because

515
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
the because you put so much on the front

516
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,039
end in waterfall

517
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,039
um you have more time to actually work

518
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
through that usable security up front

519
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,120
but you know that kind of you know you

520
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,720
can't make any adjustments right so

521
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
that's the obvious achilles hill

522
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
i think one important point is um

523
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,480
that we sometimes think that we just

524
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
like could

525
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,840
could get people to do things you know

526
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,520
like um and we can't developers so in

527
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,000
agile terms teams are responsible for

528
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
developing their own processes for like

529
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
improving their things but we need to

530
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
give them also the time and room and

531
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
that is something i think that is on the

532
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
list of the management who really should

533
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,919
like the commitment towards usability

534
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,760
which should allow those teams to

535
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,799
develop to to adapt their processes and

536
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,280
then we also need to give them tools

537
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
like knowledge what they can do

538
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
so i don't think it's just that we could

539
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
force them to do something we need to

540
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
give them room and space also for

541
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,600
develop towards more usable security

542
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,918
thank you

543
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,520
hello masterfuner from mpi first thank

544
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,600
you for the great talk and i do have a

545
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
question regarding open source

546
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,520
development teams versus industry

547
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
in industry you basically have

548
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,360
the different

549
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,080
difference between developers and

550
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
designers and ux experts

551
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
and in open source team did you get any

552
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,640
notion if the teams are more mixed or

553
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
people having different roles in the

554
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,960
same person

555
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,440
oh yes so we had like

556
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,200
an open source project i think it was

557
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
about a secure messenger that was

558
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,960
developed

559
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,039
open source and they really working as

560
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,520
on chronos as they had people sped all

561
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,720
over the world so they worked a lot with

562
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,200
commits so in security terms

563
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
and they really had rarely meetings so

564
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
because of that kind of time zone

565
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
difference and people are spread all

566
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
over the world and like all those people

567
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
and at least in that case were not

568
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,039
working specifically and only at that

569
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,960
project it was like we had like three

570
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,039
main developers and then like a team of

571
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,600
like like say like 10 or something which

572
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,679
also contributed to that kind of project

573
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,360
so that may

574
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
make things a little bit more difficult

575
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,960
in terms of user feedback and agile

576
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,039
development

577
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
great thank you

578
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,440
all right let's thank jan and marco

579
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
again
