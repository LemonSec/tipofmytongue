1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,919
hello and welcome to our talk my name is

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,359
christian schramsky and today i will

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,000
present you the results of our paper 27

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
years and 81 million opportunities later

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,080
investigating the use of email

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
encryption for an entire university

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,400
we analyzed 81 million emails over a

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,640
time span of 27 years to identify the

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
usage of email encryption at a large

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
german university we've looked at s1 and

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
pgp specifically

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
but everyone on our team already

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
expected low numbers because everyone

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,039
already knows that no one encrypts right

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,920
so why is this important then

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
email encryption has a long history of

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,760
research with many prominent papers such

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,520
as the paper why johnny can't encrypt

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,480
from 1999 and many more johnny papers in

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,800
the following decades however there's

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
one issue with these research papers

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,800
there were mostly only short lab studies

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
with few participants to evaluate the

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
usability of different email encryption

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
tools which were used as a base for the

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,840
common knowledge that email encryption

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,480
is too hard for layman

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
of course there were a few papers that

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
looked at real world data however none

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
of these looked at email encryption in

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
general the 1996 paper from woodticker

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,640
at all looked at how email users handle

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
an increasing volume of incoming emails

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,920
for that they looked at

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,000
2482 emails from 18 users this was

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
reproduced in 2006 by fisher at all with

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,880
600 mailboxes and 28 660 emails

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
the closest to our topic was in 2005 by

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,439
root at all where they analyzed which

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,200
security mechanism would have been the

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
best choice for the users

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
for that they looked at 139 000 emails

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
from 17 users

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
in 2009 we wish had all analyzed public

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,880
pgp key databases and looked at 2.7

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,960
million pgp keys to analyze key

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,840
properties and graph topologies

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
in 2018 there was another paper by

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
avigdor a grapply at all where they

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
analyzed 5 million emails to label email

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,840
threads with machine learning techniques

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,600
from that we can already see that there

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
has been no research on the actual real

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,479
world usage of email encryption so far

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,119
so our research questions were can we

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,719
confirm the security community's

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,119
anecdotal knowledge about low adaption

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,280
and provide ground truth and can we

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
validate results from previous work and

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,800
can we identify underexplored challenges

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,720
of course ethics and data protection

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
important for such a project so we spent

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,280
over a year on preparation to adhere to

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
the strict german privacy protection

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,560
laws the european general data

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,080
protection regulation

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
and oil short gdpr

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
we also involved the data protection

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
officer and the works committee early on

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,519
this took multiple alterations to

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,280
discuss open questions and fixture

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,879
effects issues

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
we made sure that researchers never got

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,200
access to raw data when needed data was

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
pseudonymized with secure hash functions

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
with random sorts that were unavailable

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
to the researchers

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
the whole data collection

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
pipeline was executed by the university

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
it staff who operate the email

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
infrastructure

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
and we of course reduced the amount of

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
data to the absolute minimum we required

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,879
to investigate our research questions

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
how did the data collection pipeline

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
work

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
it was structured as follows in the

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
first step we created a dedicated email

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,879
box with as many predefined test cases

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,120
as we could come up with and export this

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
as a json file to develop our data

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
collection and set organization scripts

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,920
after we finished the local development

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
the script was run by the university iit

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,000
staff against our own email boxes to

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
identify further issues

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
we repeated this step until we

98
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,000
encountered no further errors on our own

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,840
email boxes

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
in the third step the scripts were again

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,319
evaluated by the university it staff and

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
then executed on the secondary email

103
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
server

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
during the theodomization process we

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,319
also used additional asserts to make

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
sure that no personal data would be in

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
the results to account for weird email

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
clients that might write something into

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,640
unexpected header fields that should not

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,720
contain any personal data

111
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
if one of the inserts failed the whole

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,159
email data would be removed and marked

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,519
as an error

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
as a last step the resulting csv was

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
analyzed by the researchers to answer

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
the research questions

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
so let's continue with the results

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
in general our dataset covers a time

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,160
span of 27 years 37 089 users and about

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
81 million emails

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
five point four six percent of all users

122
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
ever used s mime or pgp at least once to

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
send an email

124
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
however that also means 94 94.5 percent

125
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
did not

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
smile certificates are free at our

127
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
university and most email users in the

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
data set are highly educated so we can

129
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
assume that this data set over reports

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
on email encryption in comparison to

131
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
other populations where users would need

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,479
to pay for an smarm certificate

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
we could observe an expected

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
exponential growth of email between 1994

135
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
and 2020 as you can see in the graph on

136
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,840
the right side

137
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
the skates are logarithmic so the

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
percentages are very hard to see here

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,240
in total we found that overall only 0.06

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
percent of the emails were encrypted and

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,520
2.8 percent were signed

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
in general smim was more widely used

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
than pgp

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,280
let's take a look at the different user

145
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
groups

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
these user groups were assigned to one

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
of five

148
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
user groups based on the sub-domains

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,759
these user groups include scientific

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
staff students external and lastly

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,160
nx internal which is used for subdomains

152
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
that don't exist anymore

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
the svm and pgp usage differs between

154
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,840
these groups

155
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,240
starting with fm we can see that users

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
from the staff group have the highest

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,360
usage of smart signatures with

158
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,960
3.26 percent of all send emails being

159
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
signed and the scientific group on the

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,720
other hand only signs two points

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
percent of the emails

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,479
furthermore students are only signing

163
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,120
0.43 of their emails

164
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
if you look at pgp we can see that the

165
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,039
order changes while the amount of signed

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,360
mails in general is much lower

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,800
users in the scientific group lead with

168
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,039
0.56 percent of signed p2p mails which

169
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,800
is only a quarter of the signed smm

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,199
emails that they are sending

171
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
second place are students with 0.32

172
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
of signed pgp merits

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,840
and lastly followed by staff users with

174
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,479
0.06 percent of signed mails

175
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
these results are not surprising since

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
most staff users are most likely using

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
pre-configured devices and work at the

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
university for a longer period

179
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,759
while students are using their own

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
devices

181
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,120
let's take a look at the most commonly

182
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
used clients for email encryption

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,880
the leader by a large margin is

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
thunderbird in combination with anecd

185
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
which accounted for 65 percent of the

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
sent smile and pgp emails

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
this is followed by outlook which was

188
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,240
used for 18.2 percent of the send s mime

189
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
and pgp emails

190
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
third place is taken by apple mail

191
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
however we cannot determine the

192
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
percentage of send emails as the copy

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
placed in the outbox by apple mail does

194
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
not contain the xml header which is

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
included in the actual send email

196
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
one thing that we could observe was that

197
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
the usage of multiple clients led to a

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
huge difference in signed smile emails

199
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,039
as you can see if only a single client

200
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,199
is used the percentage of signed emails

201
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,960
after the first signed email is on

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
median over 60

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
however if two or more different clients

204
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
are used by a user the percentage of

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
signed emails drops heavily

206
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
this indicates that users might have

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
problems configuring their certificates

208
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,639
on a different client

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
interestingly the percentage is growing

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
with more clients used which indicates

211
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,080
that power users might be able to

212
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,960
configure their clients

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
for pgp the picture looks a little bit

214
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,000
different

215
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
in general the amount of signed emails

216
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,319
is much lower it seems most users test

217
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,639
it and drop it later on again

218
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,120
however we can again see that the usage

219
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
of more than one client leads to a lower

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,160
usage of pgp

221
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
let's take a look at the pgp keys

222
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,319
themselves

223
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
as we can see in the early years dsr

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,560
keys are the most dominant choice around

225
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,039
2008 the usage of asr started to

226
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,080
overtake dsa until 2013

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
13 where most keys are using 2048 bits

228
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,319
which then changes to 4096 bits

229
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
with the introduction of autocrypt 2017

230
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
the key sizes of new sr keys are lowered

231
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
to 2048 or 3072 bits to accommodate

232
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
header size limits in emails

233
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,240
in 2019 elliptic curve crypto keys are

234
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
starting to gain traction in summary we

235
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
can conclude that pgp key types and

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,519
sizes are technology driven only a small

237
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
number of insecure keys exist

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
however more than a third of the keys do

239
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,800
not have an exploration date set

240
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,399
in contrast to pgp we could observe that

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,000
some algorithms and configurations

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,279
clearly dominate

243
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,959
default settings are widely used and

244
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
hardly customized more than 90 of the

245
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
keys were of the asr 2048 type

246
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
this means that elliptic curves and

247
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,800
larger sr keys are not relevant

248
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
fortunately we were able to identify

249
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
very few small asr keys and the last key

250
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
with sr512 was generated more than 10

251
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,519
years ago

252
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
this should no longer be valid today

253
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,720
on the other hand keys of airs are 1024

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
were still generated in 2020

255
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,600
for digital signatures we could see a

256
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,959
similar picture

257
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,279
77 percent of the certificates supported

258
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
chart 256.

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
fortunately the last md5 certificate was

260
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
generated in 2017.

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
in summary the trolling algorithms are

262
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
very homogeneous with the configurations

263
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
in the smile

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
the trust system in smart circuits is

265
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
based on third parties the certificate

266
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
authorities here we could identify clear

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,399
dominance of the deutsche telecom as

268
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,800
root certificate authority of 65 percent

269
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
of all certificates this also includes

270
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
certificates from sub-tas

271
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
the deutsche telekom is a big telecom

272
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,040
company in germany and signs the root

273
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
certificate of the dfn which is used by

274
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
most german universities to sign their

275
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
certificates

276
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
in contrast only 12 percent were

277
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
self-signed and thus not confirmed by a

278
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
third party

279
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
the use of asman thus tends to take

280
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
place in the context of organizations

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
unlike pgp keys smarm certificates have

282
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,720
a final expiration date after that the

283
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
certificate is invalid and it cannot be

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
extended users must then create a new

285
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
certificate and have it reconfirmed by a

286
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,519
certificate authority but this is done

287
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
and if so when

288
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
630 email addresses from the university

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,920
used their smart certificate one-third

290
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,279
of them actually had two or more

291
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
certificates

292
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,320
so of the few people some actually

293
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
created a certificate more often but

294
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
when

295
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
we were able to identify 364 rollovers

296
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,240
and 229 of them occurred in time before

297
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,680
the expiration

298
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,519
for 42 certificates there was a period

299
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
of time without a relativity kit

300
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,160
the university informs about the

301
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
exploration of a certificate by email

302
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,680
this occurs a few weeks before

303
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,440
expiration and is marked with the red

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
line in the graphic

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,560
many users heeded this notice and

306
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
generated a new certificate

307
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
in addition there's a large number of

308
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,040
rollovers which occurred fine in advance

309
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,399
one year and more

310
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,240
the reasons for this can be manifold and

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
are not clear to us but in many cases

312
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
such kids are probably simply lost

313
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
let us now look at some findings from

314
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
related work

315
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
buy it all reported that participants

316
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
had concerns and misconceptions about

317
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
how keys are managed across multiple

318
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
devices

319
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,839
similar comments can be found in early

320
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,320
publications on end-to-end encryption we

321
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,079
observed the impact of these concerns in

322
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,200
practice

323
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
in our data set we could see that even

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
the use of multiple email clients

325
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
significantly reduces the use of

326
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,399
end-to-end encryption one reason for

327
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,399
this certainly that the transfer of keys

328
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,240
between applications and especially

329
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
between devices is complicated

330
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
furthermore we could observe only three

331
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,519
instances of private pgp keys being sent

332
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,920
via email these emails were sent by the

333
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
users to their own mailboxes

334
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,680
probably in an attempt to distribute the

335
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,440
key to a different device

336
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,519
this is not necessarily a problem as

337
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,959
long as the chosen path race for the

338
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,800
private key is adequate

339
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
this means private key leakage through

340
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,240
email attachment was not an issue for

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,880
our users

342
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
at waterhead or argues that

343
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
semi-automated key distribution allows

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
users to send secure email

345
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,079
others argue others argue similarly and

346
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
we also agree with the statement s-mime

347
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
supports this by sending the certificate

348
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
with every signed email

349
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
at the same time however we observed

350
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
that significantly more emails were

351
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
signed than encrypted in addition we

352
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
could see that encryption was not always

353
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
used even after a successful key

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
exchange only 3.4 percent of emails are

355
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
encrypted so people did not always

356
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,680
encrypt although it would have been

357
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
possible we cannot say why but one

358
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
possible solution would be automated

359
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
encryption if it is possible

360
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
in summary previous research has so far

361
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,519
only focused on short-term studies

362
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
and we have conducted the first

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,399
large-scale analyzers of e-mail

364
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,959
encryption with a focus on swim and bgp

365
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,360
over a time span of two decades

366
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
we could observe the impact of the usage

367
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,760
of different multiple email clients

368
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
and we could observe the key exchanges

369
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
via email and the impact on further

370
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
encryption

371
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
our key findings are entry and encrypted

372
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,959
emails are very rare and we were able to

373
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
check the effect of certain events for

374
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
example the snowden leaks which doubles

375
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
the percentage of encrypted emails from

376
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,279
0.035

377
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,959
to

378
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,920
0.07 percent

379
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
and the covered 19 pandemic which lead

380
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
to an increase of general email traffic

381
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
as well as a slight increase of signed

382
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,560
emails

383
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
but at the same time a decrease of

384
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
end-to-end encrypted emails

385
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
furthermore in 2020 one-third fewer

386
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,959
certificates were issued to users

387
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
and we could confirm common beliefs and

388
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
results from previous lab studies

389
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,240
and with that i would like to thank you

390
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
for your attention

391
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:12,720
[Applause]

392
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,040
alright do we have questions

393
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,040
okay

394
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
so my question about by the way my name

395
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
is isa haril from qatar computing

396
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
research institute

397
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,680
my question is um about why do we have

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
this rare end-to-end encryption

399
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
is it because the organizations

400
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
themselves they do not encourage this

401
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,360
because you know i mean

402
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,320
maybe some tools like spam detection and

403
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
spam filtering they may not be

404
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,040
as effective when it comes to encrypted

405
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,000
emails i mean how can do do we think or

406
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
do you think that this could be one of

407
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
the reasons why we don't have that

408
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
adoption or popular adoption of

409
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,199
end-to-end encryption in addition to

410
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,839
usability and other things

411
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,440
sure yes i think that's one of the

412
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,639
problems that

413
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,000
most companies don't encourage it

414
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
at our university there was no rule

415
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,279
before we did the study that

416
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,920
the user should use smam it was always

417
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
an optional thing

418
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
during the covet pandemic which was

419
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
after our data collection

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,240
the university doctor also introduced an

421
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,639
rule that fm certificates should be used

422
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,519
by everyone so this might

423
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,920
have lead to an increase afterwards but

424
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,279
we can't say

425
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,240
that for sure because we did not

426
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,759
we did the collection before that

427
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,160
yuvraj from carnegie mellon thank you

428
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
for the talk so

429
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,360
i noticed you mentioned that like

430
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
there's multiple emails have different

431
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,560
administrative domains and everybody has

432
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,399
to sort of do that if you want into an

433
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,480
encryption so i was wondering now that

434
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
many people are on gmail or google apps

435
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
and if and they're moving to web like

436
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
using webmail if somebody like google

437
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
did this so that it was sort of not only

438
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,639
between

439
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,279
gmail.com but also if your google apps

440
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,959
would that help with that option just

441
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,399
because then you don't have to configure

442
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,759
anything because presumably it's all on

443
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,199
the web right so

444
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,519
do you see that might help

445
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,800
um sure i think if the if it would work

446
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
in within the webinar clients it would

447
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,360
certainly help with adoption um one

448
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,959
thing that would be needed was be

449
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,040
something like let's encrypt for

450
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
s9 certificates for email so that

451
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,399
those certificates would not be shown as

452
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,360
invalid

453
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
by most email clients

454
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,800
but if something like that would be

455
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,680
introduced i'm pretty sure it would help

456
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
at least with assigning efforts

457
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,000
automatically and also if encryption

458
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
would be enabled by defaulting then it

459
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
would certainly have adoption okay thank

460
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
you

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
hi jeremy epstein national science

462
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,039
foundation um

463
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,839
i'm curious if the increase in use of

464
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,359
smtp

465
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,280
uh over https or or over other

466
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,400
i'm sorry not over hbs over tls and

467
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
other encrypted email

468
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,679
uh at the point-to-point level is

469
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,919
reducing the perceived threat and

470
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,359
therefore

471
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,760
even though more people are aware of the

472
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,559
risk of unencrypted email because more

473
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,520
and more email is going encrypted not

474
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,679
end to end whether that changes

475
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,840
perceptions and maybe it's a rational

476
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
decision

477
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
not to bother with

478
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,960
svm or pgp

479
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,799
um i think in general there's a large

480
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,600
misconception among users that

481
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
email is

482
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
secure so um

483
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
in another paper that we did and we

484
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,039
heard from many users that they thought

485
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,039
that email email would be secure because

486
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,720
it's encrypted by default so they

487
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,919
do not

488
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,520
did not understand that it's not

489
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,160
end-to-end encrypted but think that it's

490
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,200
always

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
secure no matter how it's just how it's

492
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
sent

493
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
but it depends to some extent on what

494
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,240
your threat model is if your threat

495
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,520
model is is somebody in the uh coffee

496
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,679
shop listening to your email then it

497
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
doesn't matter if it's end to end as

498
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,520
long as it gets to the

499
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
gmail server or whatever encrypted

500
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
that's probably good enough but if your

501
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,679
threat model is a person in the middle

502
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
then it's a different animal

503
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
yes sure that there's a difference

504
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,840
all right any more questions

505
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,400
