1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,120
thank you first of all for the lovely

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,120
introduction hi everyone my name is

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
anantha swaneji i'm a third-year phd

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,440
student from arizona state university

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,519
and today i'll be presenting our work on

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,200
the investigation of security peer

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,920
review

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,520
process from the great work by david

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
balzarotti we observed that the academic

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
security community is experiencing an

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
exponential increase in its paper

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,720
submissions

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
and not just that

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,560
this significant growth is introducing

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
many challenges and issues throughout

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,399
the review process

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
members of the community are sharing

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,880
their frustrations and experiences

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,719
with these issues through blog posts

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,800
panel discussions and even platforms

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
such as twitter

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
and those who are not directly involved

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
with the review process like the

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
majority of us authors we are not fully

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
aware of how the peer review process

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,800
works

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
more specifically what goes between

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
submission and decision can be more or

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,520
less like a black box to us

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
we are more often of unaware of how the

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,720
science of security is evaluated

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,040
so in this work we use

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
qualitative analysis techniques

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
to investigate the peer review process

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,799
of evaluating security papers

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
thurston halls one of our program chairs

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
for oakland 2022 already explained in

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
great detail how the security or how the

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
reviewing process went for ieee smp 2022

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,079
during the opening remarks

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,920
but just to give a brief idea of how a

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
typical top tier security venue peer

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
review process would look like so this

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
is how it would go

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,119
a paper that is submitted to one of the

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,400
top four venues

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
would typically go through the paper

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
assignment process by chairs with the

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,560
help of bidding from reviewers

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
pc members can request some papers to

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,079
review if they are interested in

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,079
reviewing those

53
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,119
then after the assignment process papers

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,640
would go through several rounds of

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
reviewing including early rejections

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,759
based on the initial reviews authors may

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,479
want to submit a rebuttal a rebuttal is

58
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,159
a chance for authors to convince the

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,439
reviewers

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,360
and highlight the significance and

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
importance of their work

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
some of the papers might even be

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
selected during for pc discussions or

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,080
for extensive pc discussions before

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,040
getting a decision on those papers

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,080
awesome so by now you all know that we

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
wanted to investigate the security peer

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
review process we decided to interview

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
the peer in the peer review

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
we started with a list of pc members who

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
had served at least twice at top tier

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,800
venues

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
we then randomly sampled 70 to send out

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
invitations

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,200
21 of those agreed to have an interview

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
with us

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
and 12 even had

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,879
sharing experience

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
so over the years the community has seen

80
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
such informal discussions about issues

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
or experiences with the review process

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,519
such as

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,840
complaints about review randomness or

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,800
negative reviews or even exhaustion with

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
rolling the submission deadlines

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
what we wanted to do in this work is get

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,640
a more holistic view and understand from

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
our experts what they thought were the

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
systemic issues in the review process

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
after the long qualitative investigative

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
process we came across many insights

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
from our participants

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,720
learning from these insights

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
we learned what were the persisting

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
issues in the review process

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,120
many of our participants collectively

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
complained about randomness of reviews

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,040
randomness typically exists in the

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
review process when reviewers draw

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
different conclusions on the same paper

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
from our interview one of our

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
participants p7 mentioned that there is

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
a considerable amount of randomness even

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
at top venues in who gets to review what

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
they think of it how the discussion goes

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
and who is advocating for those papers

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
because of this randomness

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
authors might want to keep resubmitting

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
without making changes to their papers

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
and try out their luck

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
many members of the community may

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480
consider this as gaming the system

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
so p7 again in their interview said that

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,918
we as authors or reviewers cannot get

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,320
angry at this behavior of authors

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,918
and they expanded their response by

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,759
saying this

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
if we can be more accurate in our

119
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
reviews then yeah gaming the system is a

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
horrible thing to do but we are not it

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
works and so somebody whose job depends

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
on getting these papers in

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,120
why would you blame them for doing

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,600
something that works

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,000
another influencing factor that we

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
learnt from our insights is rolling

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,720
submission deadlines

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
with the increase in paper submissions

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,479
the academic security community also

130
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,000
observed the advent of rolling

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,360
submissions with major revisions

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,600
several years ago authors were forced to

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
manage their paper submissions to meet a

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
singular deadline per conference per

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,919
year

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
to improve the reviewing process

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
the concept of rolling submissions was

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,360
introduced where authors can now enjoy

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
the feasibility and flexibility with

140
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
their submissions

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
but some of my fellow authors might also

142
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
be struggling with procrastination

143
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
an interesting opportunity

144
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,320
that comes along with rolling

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,360
submissions with major revisions is that

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
now with now authors can revise their

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
papers upon feedback from reviewers

148
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
we have observed that the community is

149
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,759
also experiencing or experimenting with

150
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
this model such that

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
when ieee security and privacy

152
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,919
introduced rolling submissions

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,039
in 2018 they had 12 deadlines and they

154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
had the same model until 2020.

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,960
they moved to four deadlines in 2021

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,440
and now in 2022 we had three deadlines

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,960
moreover

158
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
the decisions or final outcomes that the

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,759
paper can

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,560
expect from the top venues is also not

161
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,199
consistent

162
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,319
we feel that the community is still

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
experimenting how to utilize rolling

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
submissions to its maximum potential

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,039
and not just authors but reviewers are

166
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
also experiencing this new challenge of

167
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
adapting with the changing model of

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
rolling submissions

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
this led to us wondering what our

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
participants thought of this revised

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
model of rolling submissions with major

172
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
revisions from the reviewer's

173
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
perspective

174
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
our participants mentioned that rolling

175
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
submissions or the revised model was

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
good to have

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
to review more fairly and it even

178
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,039
increased the review quality

179
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
the possibility of dialogue that came

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,479
with the revised model

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
helped convey reviewers expectations

182
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
instead of going into the vicious cycle

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
of rejections and resubmissions

184
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
moreover one of our participants p10

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
said that the revised model is forcing

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,199
reviewers now

187
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,479
to write more constructive reviews

188
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
apart from the obvious downfalls of the

189
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,199
rolling submissions i want to highlight

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
an interesting negative sentiment here

191
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
one of our participants mentioned that

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
now with revised model or reviewers

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
focus only

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,720
how on how ready the paper is versus how

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
significant the paper is one of our

196
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,199
participants p7

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,039
summed up the negative sentiment on the

198
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,199
revised model and said that it was a

199
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,120
growing pain to switch from single shot

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
to rolling deadlines

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
here i have grade some of the negative

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
sentiments to show that they were

203
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,639
commonly mentioned by our participants

204
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,639
and is also the general observation from

205
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
the community

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
using this opportunity i wanted to

207
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,960
highlight some uncommon issues where we

208
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,638
as a community can pay attention to

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
up until now we talked about the

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
security review process the issues that

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
our participants felt with the review

212
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
process and the new change that came in

213
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,560
the review process of rolling submission

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,400
deadlines with major revisions

215
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
let us go deeper and understand how

216
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
security papers are evaluated at top

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
tier venues

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we asked all of our participants which

219
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
evaluation metrics do you use to

220
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
evaluate security papers

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
among the many different

222
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
responses that we got from our

223
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,840
participants we observed that none of

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,720
the evaluation metrics were common

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
among all of those

226
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
this observation of ours was supported

227
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
by one of our participants p13 who had

228
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
shared a conference before when they

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
said in their interview that

230
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,919
security is an area where there are not

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,839
any kind of hardened established metrics

232
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
for evaluating security

233
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,839
however

234
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,519
our participants share certain

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,760
evaluation criteria

236
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,000
from here you can see that novelty was

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,720
mentioned by most of our participants

238
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
but did our participants mean the same

239
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,880
when they said novelty not really

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
novelty was the only evaluation metric

241
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
where we observed many subjective

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,839
responses from our participants in the

243
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,160
sense that some of our participants said

244
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
that they are evaluating novelty of a

245
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
paper through comparisons and

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
advancements over previous work whereas

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,519
others mentioned that they are looking

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
for a novel method novel technique novel

249
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
solution or novel insight from the paper

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
one even said that we are looking for a

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
wow element in the paper

252
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
so we observed that among our

253
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
participants novelty was in some sense a

254
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
judgment call and they used it as a

255
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
catch-all term

256
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
this observation of ours was also

257
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,040
supported by the chair participant p19

258
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,360
when they said that

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,680
novelty is definitely subjective this is

260
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,279
something where different reviewers will

261
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,360
see different values out of a paper

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
novelty is possibly multi-dimensional in

263
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,000
itself in terms of what are we learning

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
from this and what information from this

265
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,800
is valuable

266
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
in an attempt to understand how security

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
papers were evaluated we also came

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
across

269
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
52 red flags they were mentioned by our

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,120
participants which have tried to

271
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,079
categorize into three overarching themes

272
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,240
red flags are certain indicators in a

273
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
paper that reviewers identify to

274
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,839
recommend a reject for that

275
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,279
paper interestingly the number of red

276
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,360
flags 52 here

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,800
is almost three times the number of

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,320
evaluation metrics mentioned by our

279
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
participants

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
this may show that security researchers

281
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,560
look for concrete details when they want

282
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,120
to recommend reject

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
one of our participants p9 mentioned

284
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,959
that

285
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
we know that the acceptance rate is so

286
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
low at this conferences that sometimes

287
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
there can be a tendency from the

288
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
reviewer side to look for reasons to

289
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
reject instead of reasons for accepting

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,959
a paper

291
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
whereas another participant p10 said

292
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,160
that

293
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,079
but i think it's important to fight that

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,120
instinct

295
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
and to always frame reviews

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,839
constructively and positively

297
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
we have discussed many interesting

298
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,640
topics in our paper so if you are

299
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,200
interested please go check them out

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
before concluding my talk i would like

301
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,040
to discuss some of the recommendations

302
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,399
that we have mentioned in our paper

303
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,480
which we believe would be helpful for

304
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
the community

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
these recommendations might not be

306
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,399
immediately actionable but we feel that

307
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,680
they will definitely stir deeper

308
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
discussions within the community

309
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
further these recommendations

310
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,560
are based on the findings from our paper

311
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,800
and inspired by the discussions with our

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
participants

313
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
and they're further expanded based on

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
our understanding and deliberations of

315
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,719
the review process

316
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
from our interview data we observed that

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,519
many of our participants were not able

318
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,320
to

319
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
start reviewing early on

320
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
a quote from our participant p17 is an

321
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
example

322
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
so to help reviewers with timely review

323
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,959
submissions we make certain

324
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
recommendations

325
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
some of the pc members or reviewers

326
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,920
might be ambitiously accepting many pc

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
invitations

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,320
to avoid delegation and last minute high

329
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
level reviews

330
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
we recommend that program chairs request

331
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,200
reviewers

332
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
to limit their concurrent pc memberships

333
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
program chairs can ask reviewers to

334
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,000
submit paper summaries earlier than the

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
reviewing submission deadline

336
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,360
to ensure that reviewers do not postpone

337
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
even to start reading the paper at the

338
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
last minute

339
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,040
many of our participants

340
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
complained about negative reviews just

341
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,959
as the community is complaining about

342
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,839
negative reviews

343
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
we recommend that program chairs design

344
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
a list of quality indicators to monitor

345
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,639
reviewers performance

346
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
they can utilize the characteristics of

347
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,399
high quality reviews that we have

348
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,920
discussed in the paper as a starting

349
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,160
point

350
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
program chairs can recognize good

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
reviewing with a letter describing their

352
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,720
valuable contribution

353
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
or they can motivate reviewers to strive

354
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
for quality

355
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
with a good reviewer award

356
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,120
among the new changes made to the review

357
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
process of acm ccs 2022

358
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
they mentioned that they will now be

359
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
actively removing pc members

360
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
who fail to provide

361
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
timely and high quality reviews or even

362
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,880
fail to participate

363
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,360
in the active discussions in the active

364
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
rebuttal phase

365
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,120
from this we can see that the community

366
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,839
is not just realizing its issues but has

367
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,000
started to act toward its motivation

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
mitigation sorry

369
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
in the beginning of my presentation i

370
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
mentioned that the review process is

371
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,320
more like a black box to many of us

372
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
authors

373
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,199
so one way that we can make the process

374
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,160
or part of the process more transparent

375
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
is by including a summary of pc

376
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
discussions along with the final

377
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
decision that we get on our paper

378
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,839
this way authors will feel that they

379
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,440
have been acknowledged for submitting

380
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,680
their rebuttals as well as it will help

381
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
these authors to better understand their

382
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,240
final decision

383
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,920
another example of improving

384
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,240
transparency is involving bigger

385
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
audience in the discussions of the newly

386
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,639
proposed changes

387
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
such as the extended discussion that

388
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,399
happened during

389
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
when ieee security and privacy

390
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
introduced the new change of rolling

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,440
submissions in 2018.

392
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
overall we as a community can bring vast

393
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,959
audiences

394
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,800
and have different perspectives on

395
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
on some of the discussions or some of

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
the proposed changes that we feel

397
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
can be included in the review process

398
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,720
okay so what we can do as a community

399
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
going forward

400
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,639
firstly we can be positive and show more

401
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,680
interest in our review process

402
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
further we can design investigative

403
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,199
studies

404
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,560
to understand

405
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
what's working and what's not in our

406
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,399
review process

407
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,480
and we hope that the community

408
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
eventually will move toward a testing

409
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,000
based approach to bring rewind

410
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
refinements to its review process

411
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,320
thank you all very much for listening i

412
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,839
would like to extend my special

413
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
gratitude to our participants and

414
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,320
process on twitter and other informal

418
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
platforms

419
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800

428
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
did your paper get accepted right away

429
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
here except you're sorry right away or

430
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
did you have a major revision no yeah we

431
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,199
use the device model okay cool um

432
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
and the second thing is um people

433
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,600
tweeting will never tweet hey this was

434
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
good about the reviewing process right

435
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
they will always tweet everything sucks

436
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,079
yeah

437
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,759
did your participants have anything

438
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,120
positive to say at all about the

439
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,639
reviewing process

440
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
yeah i did mention some of the positive

441
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,880
components or positive sentiments on the

442
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
rolling submissions um so what we wanted

443
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,920
to do is we never asked our participants

444
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
in our questionnaire that what are the

445
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
issues with certain things for example

446
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,519
we ask three topics regarding the review

447
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,079
process uh rolling deadlines or the

448
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,800
revised model delegation process and the

449
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
overall sentiment or the overall

450
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,920
thoughts on the review process

451
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,759
so we ask

452
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,880
we do not

453
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,680
uh

454
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,360
kind of uh

455
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,279
prime our participants into saying that

456
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,440
oh just talk about the negative points

457
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,199
we just ask what do you feel about these

458
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,399
things what do you what are your

459
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
opinions on these things so

460
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,880
yeah we we got both the sentiments

461
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,559
positive and negative sentiments for

462
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
these two three topics yeah

463
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,760
okay thank you

464
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
hi uh noel university of maryland uh

465
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,400
obviously security is an extremely broad

466
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
discipline when it comes to areas of

467
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,640
study for the reviewers i was curious if

468
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,160
that came up at all in your feedback

469
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,839
right you know one of the challenge i

470
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,439
can imagine is like oh we have a lot of

471
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,600
people who work on crypto but not a lot

472
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
of people who work on human factors

473
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,679
stuff and so that did that did that kind

474
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,160
of disparity or anything that's sort of

475
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
made up disparity but did that ever come

476
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,280
up in the

477
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
comments from your participants

478
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
oh

479
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,760
if i'm understanding a question

480
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,679
correctly um something that

481
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
interestingly came up in our interviews

482
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
was that the community

483
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
or the reviewers and in the sense that

484
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,559
reviewers and authors

485
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,600
are mostly motivated by hype

486
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
in the sense that if papers of certain

487
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
area are getting accepted then more

488
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,799
people would write papers on those

489
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,520
topics and those so basically the

490
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,840
community will see more interest in

491
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
certain area in certain period of time

492
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,039
then there will be saturation and then

493
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,640
people will move to different topics so

494
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,400
that's what we observed thank you

495
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,600
hi alex again welcome so i'm kind of an

496
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,039
outsider to the academic publishing

497
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,760
process so perhaps a naive question

498
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
do the reviewers like

499
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
do they get

500
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
guidelines for what to look for or is it

501
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
just passed on through tribal knowledge

502
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,679
and apprenticeship you basically do it

503
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,600
long enough and you pick up the habit of

504
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
what to look for

505
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,679
the viewers in the sense of reporting or

506
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,120
writing the reviews

507
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
well or for deciding which papers to

508
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
select and writing the reviews right

509
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
other kind of established

510
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
guidelines what to look for or

511
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
okay so

512
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
i've never reviewed a paper before but

513
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
from what i've understood from my

514
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,640
advisors and every and others uh

515
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,559
who have reviewed security papers is

516
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,679
that program chairs do send out uh an

517
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,480
instruction guideline uh as to okay you

518
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,039
have to follow these steps at each phase

519
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,520
of the review process i am

520
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
yeah that's what i know okay

521
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,120
thanks and i guess you indirectly

522
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
answered the quick follow-up but the

523
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,480
paper submitters

524
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
don't know what those are so they have

525
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
to kind of reverse engineer this process

526
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
but yeah

527
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
basically through an oracle access

528
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
wouldn't it make sense for the paper

529
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
writers to know what the

530
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,480
um kind of what the acceptance

531
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
criteria are

532
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,559
uh so

533
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
okay um

534
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,440
obviously we as authors are

535
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,919
not never aware of how what do what what

536
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,760
those instructions are for the reviewers

537
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
as to how they should follow the review

538
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
process or reviewing process

539
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,440
this was an attempt to uncover some of

540
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
those parts of the review process

541
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
we have discussed um

542
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
in our appendix

543
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
what are the criteria that our

544
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
participants mentioned when they want to

545
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
recommend or an except for the paper so

546
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,600
if you want you can check it out and

547
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
yeah further work further research or

548
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,880
future work can uh show more interest in

549
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
specific parts of the review process and

550
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
uncover other interesting things from

551
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,520
those

552
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
thank you very much yeah

553
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
all right let's uh thank our speaker

554
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,770
