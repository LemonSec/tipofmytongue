1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,399
all right

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,720
hi and good afternoon everyone my name

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,279
is paul start and i am with the max

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
planck institute for security and

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,480
privacy

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,160
in bochum germany

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,559
and in this talk i present our paper ir

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,160
shield a countermeasure against

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,480
adversarial physical layer wireless

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,600
sensing

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,920
and this is a joint work with my

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,439
collaborators

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
i'm from tiarcon colonial university of

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
applied sciences and at will university

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
boohom

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
so most of us have all kind of wireless

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
devices at home and these surround us in

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
our daily lives

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
and to just give a few examples

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
these are smartphones computers internet

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,399
of things and

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
smart home devices

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,360
and

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
all of those rely on wireless

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,280
communications

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
so while the data those devices transmit

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,520
may be cryptographically

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,879
secured um

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
the underlying radio signal propagation

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
can still reveal sensitive information

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,799
and

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
that is radio signal propagation depends

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
strongly on the environment of devices

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
and as we can see in the illustration on

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
the right hand side

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
transmitted signals are reflected by the

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,080
environment and change

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,240
such as

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,439
when there is

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,080
say environmental variations such as a

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
moving individual

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
and this can be observed then by an

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
adversary who

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,000
places a receiver on the outside of this

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
of this environment so by overhearing

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
standard communication signals as we

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,320
have seen before

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,880
there are known sequences which allow

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,759
the estimation of wireless channels and

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,960
this then

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
gives the adversary the opportunity to

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
monitor victim premises

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,240
and in our paper we introduce a novel

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
countermeasure

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,159
against such attacks which is based on

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
intelligent reflecting surfaces

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
and in particular the system which we

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
call ir shield is specifically designed

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
to mitigate

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
privacy violations due to adversarial

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,879
wireless sensing

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
and ir shield partly randomizes the

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
propagation environment

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
while it is device agnostic and does not

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
affect the wireless quality of series

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
so we demonstrate that ir shield defeats

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
a state-of-the-art human motion

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
detection scheme

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,599
in our experiments we used wi-fi devices

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
and each wi-fi packet begins with a

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
preamble and this is a known and

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
standardized waveform so based on this

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
preamble the receiver estimates the

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
wireless channel which is necessary to

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,519
demodulate the subsequently received

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,959
symbols

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,400
and

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
apart from this

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,000
this channel estimate which is also

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
known as channel state information or

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
short csi

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
can also be used for wireless sensing

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
so actually there is an entire line of

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
research

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
which actually which looks into how

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,680
these csi data can be processed

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
for various samsung purposes yeah and

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
there are some exemplary sensing tasks

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
which i have listed here and these

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
include detection of motion of

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
recognition of gestures of keystrokes or

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
even vital side monitoring yeah

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
and importantly because of the broadcast

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
nature of radio wave propagation

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
a passive eave dropper can simply

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,040
overhear these signals and likewise

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,159
apply this processing and naturally this

98
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,959
has

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,159
severe privacy implications

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,840
so such an attack

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,799
was

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
implemented in a recent paper

103
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,519
of suit i presented at ndss 2020 and

104
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
here the authors proposed a human motion

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,650
detection scheme

106
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,080
[Music]

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
where

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
where the attacker where the attractory

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
eavesdropped wi-fi signals so we took

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,720
this paper and implemented the attack

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
and we place the wi-fi out here

112
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519
in a room to constantly transmit

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
packets which are received by a second

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,639
party

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,759
and the second part is on the outside

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
so the second router here is the passive

117
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
eave dropper

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,680
and

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,639
listening to the wi-fi traffic from the

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,880
from the inside on a publicly publicly

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
accessible place

122
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,759
so we

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,240
when the environment is steady

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,759
the adversary observes a rather constant

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,320
csi amplitude over time

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
and when there is motion now the

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
adversary observes strong signal

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
variation in the environment over time

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,360
so it is

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
this variation

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
is particularly strong near the line of

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,199
sight

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,039
but

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
also between is

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
like noticeable in in other regions

136
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
apart from the line of sight when when

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,479
motion takes place

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,360
um further away

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
so to quantify this variation the orders

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
of the original paper

141
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
use the sliding standard deviation on

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
this observations and here we can see

143
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,720
that the two cases with and without

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
motion are well distinguishable

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
so the adversary uses a reference

146
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
measurement to

147
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,039
determine a detection threshold

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,880
and using this threshold the

149
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
adversary then effectively detects

150
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
motion in the entire room

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
so in our work we design

152
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,479
a countermeasure against such attacks

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
based on intelligent reflecting surfaces

154
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
or short irs

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,919
and an irs is a synthetic surface which

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
is similar to a large antenna rain

157
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,639
and it provides reflective propagation

158
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,039
path between a radio transmitter and a

159
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
receiver

160
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,199
and most importantly however the irs is

161
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
digitally configurable

162
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
to

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
adjust its reflection behavior

164
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
so this can be used to then create smart

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,919
radio environments

166
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
and in particular the irs that we used

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
can multiply each reflection amplitude

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,120
either by a minus one or plus one

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
allowing to

170
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,199
optimize the sum of the reflections

171
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,479
which arrives at the receiver

172
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
so when we now take a closer look at the

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
complex valued signal propagation

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,960
components of the wireless channel

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
there is an uncontrollable person

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
and there is an irs controllable portion

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
and in a wireless communication context

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,479
this portion can be optimized for

179
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,840
example say to maximize or minimize even

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,039
the received signal power

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,039
so as we designed ir shield we resolved

182
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
the following key challenges

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,160
so first of all ir shield is capable of

184
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,039
standalone operation independent of the

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,199
wireless devices in the room

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,840
so this was particularly challenging

187
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,160
because an irs is typically carefully

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,599
integrated into the wireless

189
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
infrastructure

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
and thus it requires some interaction

191
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
with the parities which are involved

192
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
and

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
second the irs which we use is a binary

194
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,000
configurable irs and it has 256 elements

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,720
so this gives us a configuration space

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,360
of two to the 256.

197
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,240
so

198
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
obviously this is too large to to

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
extract tailored

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
configurations

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,039
and um

202
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,639
we came up with a solution which

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,400
circumvents

204
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
or which finds these these

205
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
configurations which are suited

206
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,560
and finally um we wanted ir shield to

207
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
leave the wireless communication quality

208
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,960
of service unaffected

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
so as i have outlined before

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
the adversary motion detection is based

211
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,080
on detecting signal variation which

212
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,199
indicates motion in the environment

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
so now with the irs

214
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
we gain the capability of

215
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,440
producing artificial signal variation in

216
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
the channel like towards radio waves

217
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,560
only

218
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
and

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
the irs can now be used to to also

220
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
produce signal variation which then

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,880
diminishes the adversary's success

222
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
incorrectly detecting the motion in the

223
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,958
environment

224
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,679
so effectively ir shield obfuscates the

225
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,239
mapping from signal variation to motion

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
so we want to produce signal variation

227
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,440
with the irs and to do so we randomly

228
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,560
select five percent of the irs elements

229
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
and flip their state and repeat this

230
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
20 times a second

231
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
and in effect

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
there are gradual randomized changes on

233
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,839
the signal amplitude which are observed

234
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
by the address arena

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
however

236
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,839
remember that the adversary applies the

237
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,120
sliding standard deviation and

238
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
when we look at the sliding standard

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
deviation it

240
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
remains rather low and does not yet

241
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,920
mimic

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
the effect of human motion in the

243
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
environment

244
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,839
so to resolve this

245
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,839
and in order to create an increased

246
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,880
sliding standard deviation

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,680
we now interleave this these grad

248
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
gradual randomized changes with an

249
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,959
additional inversion of the irs and the

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
inversion step is illustrated here is

251
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
the 100 percent in the time and the time

252
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
series um

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
i mean it changes all of the 100

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,839
all of the irs elements and this yields

255
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
stronger signal variation because there

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,640
is more variation um and indeed as we

257
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
can see here from from the plots um the

258
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
sliding standard deviation on the bottom

259
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
now exhibits

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
stronger variations which are similar to

261
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
the effect of human motion in the

262
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,120
environment

263
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
so here we again see the results of our

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,399
motion detection experiment and

265
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,880
importantly um the adversary can well

266
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
distinguish the cases with and without

267
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,399
motion

268
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,360
and also the threshold um

269
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
derived from the from the reference

270
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,360
measurement is like appropriate to

271
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
detect the motion correctly

272
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
and now when we enabled ir shield and

273
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
repeated the the same experiment we

274
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
first observed that the adversary

275
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
derives an overly high threshold and

276
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
thus

277
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
and thus misses like most of the motion

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,800
taking place

279
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
and

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,720
the addressability does not detect

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
motion any longer

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,160
further

283
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
for some parts of the experiment and the

284
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
cases without and with motion

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
become barely distinguishable and

286
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
in this regions motion

287
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,959
motion detection becomes even infeasible

288
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,360
however for some other parts with

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
particularly strong channel variation or

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
signal variation due to the motion

291
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
in principle motion could still be

292
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
detected and

293
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
so next we

294
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,519
we will now look at how um

295
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
like how well or how this um

296
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
this this residual detectability um

297
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,920
is is distributed in the spatial domain

298
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,320
like uh answer the question where can

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,839
motion still be detected

300
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,240
so here we see the spatial distribution

301
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,640
of the detection rates and

302
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,600
without without ir shield being active

303
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,720
and

304
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
now when we enable ir shield

305
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
the detection is largely suspended in

306
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
the entire environment and

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,880
the detection rates drop to zero percent

308
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,240
except at

309
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
very close to the transmitter i'm not

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
sure whether this is visible here on the

311
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
on the screen but there remains some

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
five percent visibility in the um like

313
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
close to the transmitting devices

314
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,680
and as i pointed out before

315
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
um one mechanism why airshield works is

316
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
because of the miscalibration of the

317
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,720
adversary's threshold and now when we

318
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
assume that the adwords server is aware

319
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
of our countermeasure

320
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
an improved threshold finding can

321
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,079
restore some of the detection

322
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,720
capabilities of the adversary

323
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
and as we can see here

324
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
the detectability

325
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
using an improved

326
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
threshold finding is

327
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
restored within the line of sight

328
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,639
and thus

329
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
we recommend to position wireless

330
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,240
devices in a environment that should be

331
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,519
protected

332
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
such that motion in the environment

333
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
could only or best not take place is

334
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,279
always unlikely to take place within

335
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,760
possible line of sight to an adversary

336
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,800
which is positioned on the outside

337
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,200
on this slide we see the packet error

338
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
rates of the wi-fi communication or

339
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
short the pers and

340
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
here we see the affected error rates

341
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,959
with and without ir shield as a function

342
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
of the modulation scheme in use

343
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
so when we increase the mcs setting

344
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
which is a wi-fi specific term we

345
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
increase the

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
basically the transmission speed because

347
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,880
we use higher order modulations

348
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,000
and what we can see is that ire shield

349
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
does not degrade

350
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
the packet error rate when it is already

351
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,720
low

352
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
but

353
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,920
for

354
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,519
higher prs when there is already a high

355
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,760
packet error rate um because

356
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
higher order modulations in this case

357
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,240
were more susceptible to noise so this

358
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,279
indicates

359
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,720
that um

360
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,519
we we then we did this measurement in a

361
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,320
in a not in a high snr setting um we

362
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
also observed that

363
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,000
our shield does also not

364
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,519
improve

365
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
the packet error rates and overall we

366
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,800
can conclude

367
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,079
that our shield does neither degrade nor

368
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,920
improve the wireless quality of service

369
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,920
this slide concludes the talk

370
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,639
we have introduced ir shield as a novel

371
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
channel obfuscation scheme which is

372
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,360
independent of devices of waveforms and

373
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
wireless standards because it directly

374
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
operates on the physical layer using the

375
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
intelligent reflecting surface

376
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
we have designed the algorithms to

377
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
configure the irs

378
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,440
to operate in a plug-and-play operation

379
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
and we have shown that it does not

380
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,000
degrade the wireless quality of service

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
finally we have investigated

382
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,399
our shield against a state-of-the-art

383
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,959
human motion detection scheme and showed

384
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,120
that it can reduce

385
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
the detection rates to five percent or

386
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
less

387
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
and also our data sets are publicly

388
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
available and please check them out and

389
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,580
i'm happy to tag questions

390
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,919
[Applause]

391
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
okay i'm studio there from penn state uh

392
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
this is fantastic but i have a couple of

393
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,920
questions

394
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,880
so you said that uh the individual cells

395
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
on like i'm just calling themselves uh

396
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,480
are

397
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,600
either like you can set the reflectivity

398
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
in yeah on that panel

399
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,720
so

400
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,800
let's say that you have configured this

401
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,759
ir shield to battle your adversary

402
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,680
right

403
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
what would happen if the adversary now

404
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,320
repositions themselves

405
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
um we have actually considered this we

406
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,800
have multiple adversarial positions in

407
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
the paper and

408
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
in fact we

409
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,440
one important thing is that we have not

410
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
optimized the ios configurations to the

411
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,759
ad reserves position

412
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,240
in the talk here i only considered one

413
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
position of the adversary but we have

414
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,959
multiple

415
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,120
transmitting transmission positions and

416
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,880
multiple adversary positions and

417
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,959
combinations of them in the paper

418
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,479
um but because

419
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
you i mean the

420
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,000
the receiver in our case is hostile so

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
we have no control over the receiver and

422
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,120
we don't know the channel to the

423
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
receiver we don't even know that the

424
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
attack is ongoing because the attacker

425
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
operates passively

426
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,759
and this is also the reason why we

427
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,199
introduced a

428
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
a probabilistic algorithm which is based

429
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,839
on randomization of the irs surface so

430
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
so the the optimization example which i

431
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
give here is only to illustrate the

432
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,320
effect of the irs and what it can can do

433
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,279
okay yeah that's that's like a one shot

434
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
answer for my question uh

435
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,199
my other question is um

436
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,640
what material is that and how do you

437
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
like what's the mechanism that you use

438
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
to alter the reflectivity i'm really

439
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,520
curious and also what radios did you use

440
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,760
okay and yeah thanks for the questions

441
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,640
um

442
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,079
this is actually something which i have

443
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,520
omitted in the talk

444
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
because it would have gone way too much

445
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,480
into detail um the the the irs

446
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
prototypes was actually were actually

447
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,640
manufactured by our colleagues from

448
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
from the teja kern um marcus heinrich

449
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
and reina kroenberger and they have done

450
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
done a fantastic job in designing these

451
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
devices and

452
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,600
they are basically um

453
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,799
simple fr4 pcb material so they they are

454
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
pretty cheap

455
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,039
so there's a there's a i have a photo of

456
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
them um there there is a microcontroller

457
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
on the back side uh which controls like

458
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,799
here we can see the configuration

459
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
circuitry there are shift registers on

460
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,400
them and we then program 256 bit words

461
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
into these surfaces so um

462
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,320
and that's basically the mechanism and

463
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,120
by

464
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
like there's a unit cell which is

465
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
replicated like all over the surface to

466
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
to build the surface

467
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,760
and

468
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
this

469
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,039
like the reflection coefficient of each

470
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,120
element is altered by by switching a

471
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
parasitic element of a pin diode that's

472
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,919
basically it and so so that's that's

473
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,480
very fundamental rf engineering

474
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
how big is it um it's it's 40 times 30

475
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
centimeters

476
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
uh just one more question uh on adaptive

477
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,679
adversaries so if you had a i mean

478
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,679
you're adding random noise right and uh

479
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,360
so did you consider settings where the

480
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
adversary gets

481
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,080
you know the person's moving back and

482
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
forth in roughly the same location over

483
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
and over again and then you can

484
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,600
try to average

485
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
out some of the random background noise

486
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,440
based on the

487
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,320
ir shield yeah

488
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
and and does it is that effective is

489
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,400
that a threat model that's relevant and

490
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
that you considered and what type of

491
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
what can our shield do about um

492
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
so what exactly do you mean by by the

493
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,039
background noise and the um

494
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
sorry uh so you're you're injecting this

495
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
like randomized signal like different

496
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
effects yeah yeah and uh so i'm just

497
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
wondering if you get multiple samples

498
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
and a lot of like masking schemes where

499
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
you got inject randomness if you can

500
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
average it out somehow then you may be

501
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
able to recover the original like

502
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
interference due to the human motion

503
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
yeah so i was asking like in this

504
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
context if you have the person walking

505
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
back and forth you get lots of samples

506
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
of that particular motion etc that's

507
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
actually um a a good question which we

508
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,760
receive received multiple times thus far

509
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,039
and um

510
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,440
there are there like theoretically there

511
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,919
are ways to to remove the effect of the

512
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
irs on the

513
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:52,960
on the

514
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,200
on the actual adversarial observation

515
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,679
that would be possible um in domains

516
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,240
like say the time of arrival at the

517
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,919
receiver where you try to distinguish

518
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,080
different signal components

519
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,559
arriving at the receiver to to to maybe

520
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
separate them and another way would be

521
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,919
to to

522
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
to distinguish signals based on the

523
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,559
angle of arrival say um but since the

524
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,480
irs in

525
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
in our case is

526
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
like very close to the legitimate

527
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
devices um

528
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,840
when

529
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
when the attacker would like would do

530
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,440
it's it they are not not well

531
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
distinguishable from the from the actual

532
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
signals yeah because because the the irs

533
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
is rather close in our experiments to

534
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,159
the to the actual transmitting device

535
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,080
and um

536
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,159
we really we believe

537
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,559
but that's future work actually um that

538
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,039
there is a power constraint on this

539
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,960
because the irs i mean it has only

540
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,400
limited size

541
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,440
so it can only reflect limited power

542
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,000
so this is also the reason why um

543
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,679
while motion in the line of sight for

544
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
example when i block the entire signal

545
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,600
there is huge signal variation with a

546
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
with an extreme dynamic range and it's

547
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
then very hard to to to obfuscate the

548
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
channel um

549
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,159
yeah but but we definitely will look

550
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,360
into into

551
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,159
such schemes in the in the future

552
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,490
fantastic let's uh thank pagan

553
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,760
[Applause]

554
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
you
