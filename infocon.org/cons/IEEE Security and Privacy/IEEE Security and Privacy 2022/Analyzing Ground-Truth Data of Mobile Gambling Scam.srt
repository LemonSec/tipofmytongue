the victims from cashing out their

focused on detecting scam gateway sites

identifying scam campaigns our scan

website lifetime a key limitation of

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,119
this works was that they were based on

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
external measurement with limited

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,000
visibility to the kill chain of gambling

47

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,920
lure victims and what's the model's

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
operation of the scan platforms so far

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
little has been done to analyze such

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,400
mobile scan apps not to mention any

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
effort to understand the underground

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,680
ecosystem behind them

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
two answer the above questions based on

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
a valuable grant data set which contains

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
more than 1000 incident reports and the

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
scan apps spending from january 1st to

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
include how scammers establish a

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
scammers deliver the scan apps to

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
victims etc

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,080
we present the first systematic study of

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,720
mobile gambling scams by a qualitative

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
study of more than one thousand skin

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,440
instant report and

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
behavior analysis of risking apps

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
in our study we model the scan activity

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
to four stage and exam layer social

73
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,280
engineering tricks scan apps and hidden

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,000
payment channels

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,239
this research has been approved by our

76
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
institutions irb in our research we only

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,120
use the previously collected data and

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
any portable pi was removed before these

79
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,599
reports

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,280
were shared with us

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
and we only placed the deposit request

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
and then withdrew all these requests

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
after collecting the transaction

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
information

85
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
over the course of this paper we did not

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,480
interact with either the victims or

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,599
scammers

88
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
we are sure that the benefits to the

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
general public faced any knowledge that

90
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,840
the criminals might obtain from the

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
high-level details present in our paper

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
in our paper first of all we investigate

93
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,239
the social engineering tricks used in

94
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
mobile gambling schemes by conducting a

95
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
qualitative study of

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
more than one thousand scan instance

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
reports

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,880
we use the qualitative open coding

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,240
technique on

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,040
1461 scan incident reports and two cyber

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
security professionals independently

102
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
reviewed a random set of 75 incident

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
reports and the reserve inconsistency

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,880
while generating the initial code book

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
they then independently code the

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
remaining reports and compare their

107
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
result by equipment of alpha coefficient

108
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
a widely used statistic measure of the

109
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
agreement achieved when coding a set of

110
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
units of analysis

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
clipping of alpha of this study is 85

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
higher than the reliability structure in

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,039
social science

114
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,880
the first stage of the gambling scheme

115
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,639
is that the scammer establishing

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
connection to victim

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
however it's well known that it is hard

118
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
for every anyone to establish the

119
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
connection with the strangers after

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
investigating this gaming scene reports

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,919
we found that most scammers average role

122
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,720
play to bootstrap the attack

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
schemer's favorite professional role

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,919
play

125
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,520
about 22 percent scammers act as the

126
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
technical staff or gambling tutors who

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
can hack into the gambling system or

128
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,400
master gambling script to have victims

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
to profit

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,120
also many scammers establishing romantic

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
or close relationships with victims such

132
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
as boyfriend or girlfriend to build the

133
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,600
trust apart from that some schema choose

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
a law with higher social status

135
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,199
and prestige such such as law

136
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,080
enforcement officers to con contact

137
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,319
victims

138
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,800
as for the victim recruitment channel

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
different from traditional scams which

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
heavily relies on telephone

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
sms

142
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,600
and in email our study reports that

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
mobile gambling schemes contact victims

144
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
for more diverse

145
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
reasons such as house renting and job

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,479
hunting through various approaches such

147
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
as local volumes

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
and online qna platforms

149
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
a critical step in gambling scams

150
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
activity is delivering

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,680
apps to victims to achieve this goal

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
schemers leverage several psychological

153
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,919
strategies

154
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,680
we called a strategy as schema driven

155
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,319
when schemers persuade the victim to

156
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
download gambling apps

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
and the code of

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
victim driver means that a victim

159
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,000
proactively requests a gambling apps

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
after being baited for example scammers

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
continuously discuss

162
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
and show gambling profit gains in group

163
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
channels or posting their gambling

164
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,880
incomes on social media

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
interestingly when comparing this game

166
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
loss between the case called as game

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
driven and victim driver we found that

168
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,039
scam laws of victim jibber are

169
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
significantly higher than scammer driver

170
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
this difference indicates that the

171
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,639
social engineering tricks which lure

172
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,520
victim to request gambling apps

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,960
proactively are more efficient at taking

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,000
victim out of money

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,879
after delivering scam apps scammers

176
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,000
start to enforce the victims to deposit

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
mining continually

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,479
this step can be characterized into two

179
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,919
subtypes

180
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,520
the incentive and the pressure the

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,360
incentive strategy

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,319
a scammer will show the incentives for

183
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,800
continually deposing money such as the

184
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
winning bonus

185
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,520
and meanwhile

186
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
11 of scammers put psychological

187
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,680
pressure only victim if they do not make

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
deposits

189
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
although this gamer preferred to use the

190
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,319
incentive to lure victim we found that

191
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560
these two strategies pose similar

192
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,440
success rate

193
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
all instant reports in our study

194
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,919
are associated with the casual scams for

195
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,039
example

196
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,200
scammers prevent victims from cashing

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,120
out gambling incomes

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,559
and we categorize this schema logic into

199
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,440
two subtypes disable app functionality

200
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
and modify the account

201
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,480
most scammers deploy less gaming logic

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,279
by disabling scan apps functionality

203
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
which means that the victim accounts are

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
frozen

205
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
all this cash out function is disabled

206
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,680
meanwhile a 222 scammers directly wipe

207
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
out the victim balance

208
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,560
which

209
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
was coded as modified accounts

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,160
apart from above social engineering

211
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,480
tricks the schemers also carefully

212
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
crafted scan apps to help launch the

213
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
attack we will show how the app

214
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
customize their distribution channels

215
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
developer framework permission

216
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,320
declaration compatibility requirement

217
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,120
and network infrastructure to launch the

218
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519
attack

219
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
after comparing the packaging and the

220
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
bundle name of gambling apps we found

221
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
that none of these gambling scan apps

222
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
can

223
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
be found through reputable app markets

224
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
however settling apps on android and ios

225
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,760
requires configuration changes in

226
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
respective system settings

227
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
we try our best to figure out how

228
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
typical and non-technical victims manage

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
to carry out a series of actions to

230
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
satellite apps

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
by visiting scan apps download links

232
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,240
recorded in lead reports we learned that

233
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
the scammers typically provide

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,120
step-by-step tutorials for site loading

235
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,839
apps on app download pages

236
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
victims only need about four or five

237
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
clicks to set load an app following

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
these tutorials

239
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,399
as shown only size

240
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,640
and when we examine the developer

241
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,839
framework of gamma risk apps we found

242
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,200
scammers abuse online app generator oag

243
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
for short

244
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
to automatically generate scan apps as

245
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
well as scientist apps

246
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
compared with genuine gambling apps

247
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
gamers can absolutely request some more

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,440
dangerous permission to support social

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
engineering tricks such as keep user

250
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
sickness while sending push message or

251
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,839
constructing built-in im

252
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,560
we also inspect the compatibility of

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
gambling scan apps and genuine gambling

254
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,399
apps the blue one is gambling scan apps

255
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
and the broad is genuine gaming app and

256
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,000
the green and red is karma apps from

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
google play and third party app store

258
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,760
respectively

259
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,000
we found that gambling scan apps tend to

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,880
declare lower requirements for minima os

261
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
versions and to ensure compatibility

262
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
across versions

263
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
and thus can cover more victims even

264
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
though their development sdk versions

265
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
are not upstate

266
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,800
almost all skin has killer

267
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,640
minima sdk versions to be 19

268
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,320
aka android version 4.4 or lower what's

269
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
more we observe 80 scam apps that even

270
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,920
support android 4.0.4

271
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,639
which released in 2012

272
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
with target sdk

273
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,800
28 and 29

274
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
similar funding can be observed in ios

275
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,399
apps

276
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,120
besides the compatibility of genuine

277
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,680
gambling apps is consistent with

278
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,320
gambling apps but not with gambling scan

279
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,639
apps

280
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
we also set up the backend url

281
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
identification and traffic profiling

282
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
tool chain to discover the backend

283
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,399
infrastructure of gambling scan apps

284
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,480
we found that cameras can absolute

285
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
average distributors even low

286
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,440
distributor pools to distribute back-end

287
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
servers which significantly improves

288
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,240
scan app's robustness

289
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,880
after diving into this app's distributor

290
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,519
and back-end server domain lifecycle we

291
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,839
found that more than 55 percent of

292
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,399
back-end servers was registered less

293
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,160
than two years ago

294
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,519
and 12 percent less than one month ago

295
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,360
while the distributed domains was

296
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,320
registered 5 years ago and this

297
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,040
difference may help us to construct more

298
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
efficient detection strategies

299
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
and next we analyze the various payment

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
channels of mobile scan apps to

301
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,959
understand

302
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,920
gambling deposit operations and estimate

303
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
the revenue of online gambling scan

304
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
activities

305
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,279
since scan apps usually embedded with

306
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,680
multi-factor authentication method

307
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
before displaying payment

308
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,519
details we manually investigate 100 scan

309
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
apps to determine their payment channels

310
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,480
in addition to traditional

311
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
bank payment channels and online payment

312
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,839
service

313
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,200
reported in

314
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
previous works we observed

315
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
schemers heavily adopt a nominized

316
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
payment method such as cryptocurrency

317
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,639
including teaser and the cgpa and use

318
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
money more based

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,720
payment method such as

320
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,959
idle fish money more and we will

321
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,120
introduce the normal payment channels in

322
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
the following slides

323
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,480
and this figure shows that in the

324
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
payment channel of idolfish money more

325
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,920
in step 1 scammer recruits money most

326
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,639
who control seller and buyer of a free

327
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,519
market app named idolfish to transfer

328
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,720
gambling deposit more specifically in

329
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
step 2 when a victim found the account

330
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,560
to gamble a scan app will trigger a task

331
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,680
which is step 3 asks a

332
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
money more to generate an idol fish

333
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,360
order of the account and then return the

334
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,000
peer pay link which is a kind of link

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
generated to allow the payment by other

336
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
parties

337
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,040
in step 4 the peer pay link is

338
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
associated with the counterface idolfish

339
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
order to learn victim

340
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
after that

341
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
scan apps usually ask a victim to scan

342
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,320
the qr code to deposit money and the

343
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,199
peer pay link web page looks exactly the

344
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,760
same as the normal online payment web

345
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
page making the payment innocent

346
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,519
during a payment procedure victims do

347
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,199
not need to register in idolfish instead

348
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,079
they pay by the peer pay link

349
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
in the online payment apps such as

350
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
alipay

351
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
and when finishing the purchase on idle

352
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,279
fish the money more will transfer the

353
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,600
income and obtain commissions

354
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
let's surely take away based on a

355
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
variable ground choose data set which

356
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,000
contains more than one thousand instant

357
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,800

362
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,959
activities to four stage and exam layer

363
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,920
social engineering checks scan apps and

364
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,639
hidden payment channels

365
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,560
