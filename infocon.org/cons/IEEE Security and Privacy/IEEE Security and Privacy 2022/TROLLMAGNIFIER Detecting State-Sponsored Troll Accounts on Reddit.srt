1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,719
you

2
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,080
yeah thanks dave

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,760
um so

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,920
i'm here to present troll magnifier

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,839
which is a tool that we build which

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,760
detects state sponsor troll accounts on

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
reddit

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
so kind of start off discussing about

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,599
troll accounts we should discuss

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
what influence campaigns are

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,720
so

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
influence campaigns are basically

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,119
campaigns that are orchestrated by state

14
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,320
actors to polarize public discourse or

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,279
push particular agendas online

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,119
now we observed that there was a rise in

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,120
influence campaigns on social media to

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
manipulate public opinion

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
and these campaigns are usually

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
performed through instrumented accounts

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,879
also known as troll accounts

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
so a few examples of these influence

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
campaigns the first one is there's been

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,640
troll accounts employed by russian state

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,360
agencies which posted content on social

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,440
media to further kremlin's political

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
agenda

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
there's been influence campaigns

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
targeting u.s presidential elections in

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,760
2017

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,799
um where 2.7 k twitter accounts were

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
identified as a russian troll accounts

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
so let's talk about troll accounts now

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
the way we define it troll accounts are

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,880
created by these malicious actors to

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
engage in discussions amongst each other

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,200
and with real world users

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,720
and what they do is they interact to

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,040
push certain narratives and share false

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
information online

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
and while they're at it they would aim

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
to simulate legitimate discussion to

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
appear real and to blend inside these

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
communities

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
they've been all over the news

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,880
this is an article where 944 of these

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
accounts were identified and booted from

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,320
reddit

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
500 industrial accounts were caught

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
spreading fake news about u.s

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
presidential elections

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
and then again some more russian-backed

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
trolls that were targeting new elections

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,680
so they tend to like

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
be activated around these important

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
events

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,799
so how are these accounts currently

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,200
identified well in past research show

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
accounts um troll accounts are different

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
from

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
normal malicious activity and bots in

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
that they're controlled manually by

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
humans and um they do not show strict

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
synchronization patterns that are

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,319
typical of automated activity

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,520
so they would um and they're also more

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
similar to like regular users because um

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
the state actors would make these

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
accounts and control them manually and

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
try to push these agendas and appear

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,400
real as i discussed before so the past

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
research about mass created fake

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,879
accounts cannot work on this

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,319
so typically

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
reddit as i discussed before and some

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,519
social networks have identified these

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,840
troll accounts via ad hoc analysis but

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,000
we lack good automated techniques to

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
find these accounts

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,920
so we start off with our two research

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
goals we want to automatically detect

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,000
these accounts and we want to enable

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
content moderation so these accounts can

84
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
be flagged

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
so how do we detect them

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
well the key is in interaction patterns

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
as we observed that these accounts show

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
loose coordination patterns so what they

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
would do is um troll accounts that

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
belong to the same campaign would often

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,879
reply to one another and they would

92
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
follow up to discussions started by

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,720
other troll accounts to appear real and

94
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
keep the discussion alive

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
and as researchers we can learn these

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
interaction patterns and leverage them

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,519
for automated detection

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,599
so we start off by using this data set

99
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,120
of 335 russian sponsor troll accounts

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
which were identified on reddit and they

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
were active between 2015 and 2018.

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,040
they had around 7000 comments in total

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
and around 14 000 submissions

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
submissions are basically posts on

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
reddit like the main post that people

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
make and then others can comment under

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
it

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
um so we started off with the premise

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
that do these rule accounts interact

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
with each other more than regular

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
accounts you want to proof for it so we

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
compared the activity of these role

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
accounts with random users that were

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
active on the same subreddits as these

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,159
accounts were

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,319
and our very first finding was

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
that these role accounts are indeed more

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
likely to comment on posts that were

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
started by other troll accounts as

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,560
compared to random users

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,680
they would

122
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
be more likely to comment on the same

123
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,918
posts at other troll accounts than

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
random users are

125
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
and they would also be very likely to

126
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
share two posts with the same titles so

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
they would

128
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
take these posts and repost them all

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
over reddit and different subreddits and

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
stuff like that

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
and when compared with random accounts

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,479
on the same subreddits

133
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,280
so yeah so now we have an idea these

134
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
accounts do indeed show these

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
interaction patterns and we can leverage

136
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
these to distinguish them from regular

137
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,840
accounts

138
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
so now we'd like to present our system

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
which is the troll magnifier um here's

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
the entire pipeline for it but we should

141
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
break it down step by step

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,600
so the first step is pre-filtering and

143
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
it takes two input streams one a seed

144
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
data set and two

145
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
a bigger data set to find more troll

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
accounts from so in this case we use the

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
c data set of 335

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
russian trolls as i mentioned earlier we

149
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
use the same data set but really we

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
could use any data set to learn these

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
patterns and find more of these accounts

152
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
and for the reddit data we feed it um

153
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
all the comments and submissions from

154
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
2005 to 2020 there is a public archive

155
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
from push shift

156
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
that we use and from those accounts uh

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,199
the entire data we filter out accounts

158
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
that a commented on a troll account

159
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,240
submission before or made a submission

160
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
with the same title as a troll account

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
this gives us a small data set to a

162
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
smaller data set to work on to find more

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,039
potential trolls from

164
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
so after pre-filtering these accounts we

165
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,039
are left with around 53 53 000 accounts

166
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,759
to choose from

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
the next step is um building these

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
threads so in reddit if um some of your

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
info unfamiliar fit

170
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,759
there is a submission as i said before

171
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
and then people can comment under it and

172
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,000
each comment can have multiple comments

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
so the data set that we have

174
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
was raw json so these linkages were

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,440
missing but they had their ids so in

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
this step troll magnifier would recreate

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
this original thread structure to

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,520
perform additional analysis

179
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,880
next we move on to build the detection

180
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,800
model

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
some highlights from our preliminary

182
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
analysis which is a part of

183
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,039
building the model as well that these

184
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,440
troll accounts are created in waves too

185
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,560
so they would

186
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,479
on same date we would find multiple

187
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
accounts being created

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
and they would target specific

189
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,599
subreddits

190
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,120
they tend to delete some of their

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
comments and submissions after the fact

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
to remove any history of their

193
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
activities

194
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
and then we found instances of these

195
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
troll accounts as i discussed before

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,639
directly replying to each other on

197
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,680
different

198
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
subreddits to simulate a discussion so

199
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
these are some of the findings that we

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
have but we put all of these together

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,000
in a feature list for an account to

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
train our classifiers the first three

203
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
deal more with account information so

204
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,560
how many comments has an account made

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,479
how many submissions does it have and

206
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,840
the age of the account and then there's

207
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,759
a list of features that are more related

208
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
to interaction with troll accounts so

209
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,479
for example

210
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,319
uh the fraction of submissions that it

211
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,479
has with the same title as a troll

212
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,599
account

213
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
the fraction of comments on submissions

214
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
that other troll accounts commented on

215
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
which makes it easier to see if they

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
follow the same

217
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,919
patterns so with this feature list we

218
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
move on to train our classifier we

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,960
perform supervised learning learning the

220
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,639
typical behavior of these known trolls

221
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
and finding more that behave the same

222
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,080
way

223
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
we perform 10 full cross validation um

224
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
and random forest classifier seems to

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,080
perform the best on our data set and

226
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
when we run it in the wild we find 1248

227
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,400
potential troll accounts from the 53 000

228
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,599
data set

229
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,440
so next step is validation now

230
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,319
validation for this is tricky because

231
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,560
there is no way to know for sure if an

232
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
account is a troll

233
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
we shared our results with reddit but we

234
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
haven't heard back from them

235
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
so we kind of use proxy ways to go about

236
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,919
validating these accounts so there are

237
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
two ways we go about it account level

238
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
and group level

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,640
let's discuss account level first

240
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
so for each of these accounts we would

241
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,240
check if they're active on sub uh reddit

242
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
so whether they have been deleted or not

243
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
now deleted in this sense would be uh

244
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
whether they got involved in some

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
malicious activity and got deleted or

246
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
suspended from reddit which raises the

247
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
chance of that account being malicious

248
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,160
or

249
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
be flagged for some reason

250
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
we've found that 298 of these accounts

251
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,560
have been suspended or deleted as of now

252
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
and then we checked if they have any

253
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,720
deleted messages so we found that three

254
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
or four of these accounts deleted any

255
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
like some of their comments or

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
submissions which is as we discussed

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
before something that troll accounts do

258
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,920
they would delete their comments and

259
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,640
submissions after the fact

260
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
and then there's creation data analysis

261
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
um so this pertains to we see how many

262
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,640
of these accounts were created on the

263
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,839
same date as a known troll so we found

264
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
66 of them being created on the same day

265
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
as a known troll account

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
and then we get a bit

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
broader we would see the topics that

268
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
they discussed

269
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
we found that 359 of these accounts

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
posted a comment or a post that

271
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,240
contained one of the top 10 keyword

272
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,160
keywords that the troll accounts were

273
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,959
using the known troll accounts

274
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
so all in all um

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
824 of these accounts satisfied at least

276
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
one of the four conditions which is like

277
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,880
66 of the data set

278
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,920
of potential trolls

279
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,000
so next up is uh group level validation

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
so we want to see as a group how these

281
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,200
accounts were interacting to

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
potentially see if they are actually

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
trolls validate them so the first way we

284
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,839
go about it is by language analysis

285
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
so we found that crypto is a very

286
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
popular word that these troll accounts

287
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,279
would use so we trained three word to

288
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
egg models one on the known troll

289
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,720
accounts

290
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,959
the second one on these detected trolls

291
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
and the third one on the non-trolls the

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
rest of the 53 000

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
and we construct a graph of words that

294
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
were related to crypto for each model

295
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
and then we identify communities in it

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
using the luvian community detection

297
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
algorithm which

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,519
basically identifies in

299
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
colors um these in the same way in the

300
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
visualizations i'll show you on the next

301
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
slide

302
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
but all in all we find that the known

303
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,279
trolls and the detected trolls have much

304
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,839
more words in common which we have kind

305
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,560
of

306
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
um made bigger try to make bigger i

307
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
don't know if you guys can see um

308
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
the first uh on the left most side is

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
the graph for crypto for known trolls

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
the middle one is for the detected

311
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
trolls and the last one is for the

312
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
non-trolls

313
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
the words

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
highlighted are the words in common with

315
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
the known trolls and we found that

316
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
not only do detected trolls and

317
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
non-throws have much more words in

318
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,000
common um the non-trolls have a very

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,399
different language uh than these troll

320
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,640
accounts they would discuss the crypto

321
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
in a very generic sense

322
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,360
whereas the languages of the trolls is

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
much more generic much more informal and

324
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,560
sometimes inflammatory

325
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
next up is the time series evaluation so

326
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,279
again we plot the time series for these

327
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,959
three data sets the known trolls the

328
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
non-trolls and the detection trolls um

329
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
to see kind of any coordination patterns

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
that we would observe um so we find that

331
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
they do indeed show synchronization the

332
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,800
detected trolls and the known trolls and

333
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
burst the activity whereas for

334
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
non-trolls uh they're much more uniform

335
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
here's the left graph is for the

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,240
comments um the peak

337
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
uh on the at the 2018 mark is a

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,240
coordination pattern that we found for

339
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,959
the detected and the known trolls

340
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,680
and

341
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
and for the submissions as well we found

342
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,519
that the correlation and lag

343
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
is much less uh for the known and

344
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,680
detected shows which means that they do

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
indeed have a higher synchronization as

346
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
compared to that accounts that were not

347
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
flagged as trolls by our system

348
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
so once we have all of this uh we kind

349
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
of go over and see if we can find

350
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,399
something interesting in uh

351
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,639
as case studies to show

352
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,800
how these accounts were acting and what

353
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
they were talking about uh so the first

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
thing that we observed is these accounts

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,200
would manufacture conflict so they would

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,839
go up in teams of two and three and they

357
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,200
would try to create conflict and

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,440
controversy on

359
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
like

360
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
different topics so in this example

361
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
um there's three accounts of interest

362
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
men underscore like which is a known

363
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
troll account which was publicly uh

364
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
identified by reddit there's a troll one

365
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
which we detected so it's blurred out

366
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
for privacy reasons and there is another

367
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
account which was deleted by its owner

368
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
so in this thread

369
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,040
the troll one the for the detected troll

370
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
would first shame the turkish military

371
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,720
um and then men underscore like which is

372
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
a detective uh sorry non-troll would uh

373
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
say that turkish people are not to be

374
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,920
trusted at all sorry if there's any

375
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
turks here no mean defense

376
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
um and then the now deleted account

377
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
would accuse men underscore like of

378
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,959
racism this is textbook controversy they

379
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,839
would just throw back and forth um and

380
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,839
try to create you know

381
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
conflict in these subreddits and key uh

382
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,560
topics

383
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
the next thing uh so as i discussed

384
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,720
before these accounts want to appear

385
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,839
legitimate

386
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
they don't want to be flagged as trolls

387
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
so they would post content that is not

388
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,680
related to their primary purpose

389
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
so we found three accounts posting

390
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
amusing pictures of dogs to look more

391
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
legitimate and blend into the reddit

392
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,440
community

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,120
the leftmost is by a known troll

394
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,639
and the other two uh which are their uh

395
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,279
posters are blurred out again uh are by

396
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,240
detected trolls uh through our system

397
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
so these would post cute dog pictures

398
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,399
and memes and jokes to look more real

399
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
and hide their actual agendas

400
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
so

401
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
what are the takeaways

402
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
well the first thing we find is these

403
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,000
role accounts show loose coordination

404
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
patterns

405
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
they often interact with each other to

406
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
push specific narratives

407
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,360
we find 12 48 of these potential role

408
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,320
accounts in the wild

409
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,079
we all in all provide an automated

410
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,399
mechanism to detect these accounts

411
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
and we believe that our system can serve

412
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,480
as a blueprint for practitioners to

413
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
build production level detection systems

414
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
but as in all work we have our

415
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,079
limitations so the first one

416
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
is that we do require a set of known

417
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
trolls to start off with

418
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
and we do not have definite proof of

419
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,639
these detected accounts to be actual

420
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
trolls

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
but in future um we have a couple of

422
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
interesting ideas that it would be

423
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
interesting to investigate behavioral

424
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
features that are independent of the

425
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079
specific campaign that these role

426
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,600
accounts belong to

427
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
and

428
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
researchers should use ground truth to

429
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
investigate whether our system can

430
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
generalize to additional influence

431
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
campaigns

432
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,759
and it would be also interesting to look

433
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
at the actual narratives uh being pushed

434
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,560
by troll accounts we did go over a bit

435
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
in how they work and operate but it

436
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,759
would be interesting to you know in a

437
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
broader way analyze these strategies

438
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
employed by these accounts and how they

439
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,839
interact with each other to spread a

440
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,399
particular narrative

441
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
so yeah that's all from my side thank

442
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,510
you very much

443
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:20,079
[Applause]

444
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,839
thanks a lot we have some time for

445
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,240
questions if someone wants to uh please

446
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,279
hello uh thanks for the talk

447
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,399
uh so your system just uh depends on

448
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,199
this initial set of trolls and uh

449
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
because you're using connections between

450
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,360
the trolls it's inherently biased

451
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,759
towards the initial set from what i

452
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,800
understand

453
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
uh is that an issue one and if it is uh

454
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
what do you think the mitigation is how

455
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
do you make it more generalizable yes so

456
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
on our own um which is not published we

457
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
have tried like our system on additional

458
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,759
influence campaigns and this system does

459
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,720
indeed hold but yeah um that's a that's

460
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,279
a valid point but yes our belief is that

461
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,280
this can be generalized

462
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,599
all right

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,520
thanks very much interesting talk um

464
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,039
i was curious whether uh you assume that

465
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,000
the

466
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
trolls will eventually download your

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,880
tool

468
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,160
and uh start using it and adjusting

469
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
their behavior accordingly just as you

470
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
talked about the dogs

471
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
how much of this

472
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,280
is is an addressable problem and how

473
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
much is it is it just going to be a

474
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
continuing arms race

475
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
yeah um so we talk about in the paper a

476
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
bit about resilience to evasion so even

477
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,760
if they do get this and they try to

478
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,440
reduce their activity to reduce the

479
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,799
interactions um to appear uh to get not

480
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,960
flagged by our system they're kind of

481
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,840
you know

482
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,960
not effective enough anymore um the

483
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,799
primary idea of them is to be able to

484
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,320
interact and push these ideas if they

485
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,679
reduce their activity or their

486
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
interaction patterns um we might not

487
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
catch them but they're not getting

488
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,960
anything done either so

489
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,320
hi uh thanks for the talk how quickly

490
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
can your approach actually start

491
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
detecting these troll accounts because

492
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,440
you're relying on interaction so i

493
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
assume there's like a minimum threshold

494
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
of directions that has to be done before

495
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
the system can actually work

496
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,280
um

497
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,240
yes but this system also works on the

498
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
fraction of their entire comments or

499
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
submissions to as a feature so even if

500
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
they have a few and they're uh

501
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
interacting in ways trolls do

502
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
um

503
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
we would be able to identify them i

504
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
believe okay so the system could

505
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
actually be like deployed in the real

506
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,640
world and quickly like take down these

507
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,679
accounts the uh the bottleneck here is

508
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,960
the data so a collection of the data

509
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
when we use the push shift api um it

510
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
takes a bit of time to download this

511
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,679
data but the the bottleneck is there not

512
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,200
in training the system okay so given a

513
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,039
real-time feed the approach yes we

514
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,799
believe it could work okay thanks yeah

515
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,400
i don't know if you're familiar with the

516
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
work of adrian chen uh he was a

517
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,919
journalist who

518
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,400
basically studied russian trolling back

519
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
in 2015 and one of the things that he

520
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
found

521
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
was

522
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,039
the simplest way to identify russian uh

523
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,840
trolling was looking at the time that

524
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,360
they were posting it turned out to be a

525
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
nine-to-five job

526
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
for people who went to the same building

527
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,799
to work every day

528
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
is that something that you're able to

529
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
identify here as well

530
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
i mean they do have coordination

531
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,000
patterns timing is a big thing they get

532
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
created on the same dates they you know

533
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
sometimes post at same times

534
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
timing is definitely a big factor in the

535
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,799
way these accounts operate yes i wonder

536
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,679
if uh if you got help from reddit and

537
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,520
got perhaps these ip addresses could you

538
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
just relocate them to a building because

539
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,919
that's what he found yes yes dre

540
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,520
obviously has much more data than we

541
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,960
have much more information and that's

542
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,799
why we contacted them in the first place

543
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,440
haven't heard back got it but yeah yeah

544
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,919
fascinating stuff thank you so much

545
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,960
all right let's thank the speaker again

546
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,399
you
