1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,720
hello everyone i will present today

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,640
tachara cruising with design for

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,400
enhancing significant resource education

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,160
in interdependent systems this is mr

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,799
abdullah from ece alberta university and

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,320
that's based on the joint work with my

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,160
colleagues and advisors from four

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
different institutions

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,800
so the agenda for today will be as

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,320
follows i will start with the motivation

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,080
for our work and then the interdependent

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,720
system set up and then we can design our

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
evaluation and i will then conclude the

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,320
all

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,479
there are too many challenges in today's

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,719
systems security the first one the

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
security issues because everything is

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,320
now connected to the internet there is a

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,879
huge increase in cyber threats and the

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,920
second

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
issue is the high costs because the cost

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,719
of higher or the high cost of the

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,879
successful act so for example here i'm

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,160
showing

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
from the center for strategic and

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
international studies

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
that there is exponential growth in the

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,719
number of cyber attack incidents with 1

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,879
million plus reported losses in the last

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,199
decade on institutions and governments

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,040
and actually we explore in particular

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
the human decision making in security

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
the existence of human and

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
decision-making security has been

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
revealed and was explored in several

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,880
works but actually most of the

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,080
literature

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,240
considered optimal decision making such

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
as these similar works and surveys that

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,119
focus that humanitarian maker is

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,200
rational and has optimal decision making

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
strategy however behavioral economics

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
show that humans are already partly

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
rational and deviate from such classical

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,600
models

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
prospect theory for example showed that

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
actually human would deviate from such

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
classical models

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,520
in particular prospect theory showed

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
that human perceptions of losses and

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
probabilities would be different from

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
the true values which would lead to a

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,920
significant impact on the security

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
investments made by the stakeholders or

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
defenders in particular

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,000
it was it has been shown that humans

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
overweight low risk and underweight high

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
risk as shown here there are

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
a huge amount of the literature that

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
proved such behavior in vertical

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
here i am showing two similar papers of

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
predict and gonzalez that has this

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,959
mathematical form where alpha controls

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,720
the extent of overweighting and

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
underweighting if alpha equals one

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,959
actually here we have a rational

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
decision maker but if alpha is less than

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
one we have a behavioral decision maker

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
that overweight and underweight

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
probabilities depending on the region

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,959
now i provide the interdependent system

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
setup so we consider a directed acyclic

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
graph which is general

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
a general graph g with a set of nodes v

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
and set of edges e and each node

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,160
represent an asset in the system and the

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
attacker can start her attack from a

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
source node a

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
and we have multiple defenders each

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
defender is responsible for a subset of

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,239
the assets for example here defender d2

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
is responsible for defending

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
these green nodes

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,120
and when an acid v is compromised it can

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,959
be used by the attacker to attack

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
another acid vj if there is a connection

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,920
or edge between these two nodes

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,319
and this attack on that hvi vg has a

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,239
probability of success which is we

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
denote by bij

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,360
and we consider li as the financial loss

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
that the defender would

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,560
have if her asset vi is compromised by

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
that

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,959
under such attack we consider defense

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,959
strategies where we consider that the

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,200
defender can allocate resources on the

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
edges to reduce the attack probability

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
or risk where x ijk is the defense

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
allocation by defender dk on the lg vivj

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,920
and will assume that multiple defenders

102
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
can assign defense resources on the same

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
age for joint defense

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
therefore the successful attack

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
probability would be ideally a

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
decreasing function in the total

107
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
investment x ij on that edge

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
and also we capture the

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,239
real world scenario that each defender

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,080
does not have infrared budget but each

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
one has a limited security budget pk

112
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,920
where the summation of all of my

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,478
security investments are ever bounded by

114
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,358
these people

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
before going to formulation of the true

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
cost of our

117
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
problem actually i would like to

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
emphasize that each asset here can be

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
attacked using several ways or several

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,320
baths so here for example the node vj

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
can be attacked using this path with two

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,880
edges or these paths with three edges

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
and therefore the attack property on a

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
bath for example this red colored path

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
would be the product of the

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,680
probabilities of successful attack on

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
all of the edges on that path and to

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
assume that the attacker is a worst case

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,199
scenario or chooses the most vulnerable

130
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,600
death from the source node a to the

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
asset

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
and actually this general or worst case

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
scenario can be used to model unknown

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
attacker strategies

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
therefore the cost of the defender will

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
be given by this formulation

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,680
which is

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
for each bath we have a probability of

139
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
successful attack and we aim to minimize

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
the maximum bet among all of the

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
possible benefits to the svm if the

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,759
attack succeeded we will have a loss and

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
m but remember that

144
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,479
the we don't have a single loss but each

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
defender has several assets and

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
therefore will do summation over all of

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the losses of all of these assets

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
but we as humans are not rational

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
decision makers but we are

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
behavioral decision makers and therefore

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
here we

152
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
consider such uh behavioral bias or

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,919
misperception from birth theory where

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,919
the perceived cost is pretty similar to

155
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,639
the true cost but with the fact that the

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,880
defender would perceive the risk for the

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
risk of successful attack on each age in

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
that category

159
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
under such setup we seek to answer two

160
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
main research questions first one is how

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
does misreception would lead

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
to or affect the optimal security

163
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
investments and second how can we

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
incentivize stakeholders and encourage

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
them for better security decision making

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
to answer the first question

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,560
actually we explored the impact of the

168
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
behavior bias on investments and as

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
shown here actually behavioral

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
bias would lead to

171
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
some optimal investments which would

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,240
increase the loss so actually in our

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
previous work on hsccs last year we

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
showed that risk misperception would

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
lead to sub-optimal security investments

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
and these sub-optimal security

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
investments would lead to much higher

178
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,759
security loss for example here for this

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,919
symbol setup will have 2x increase in

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
the expected security loss i am just

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
asking you to imagine how would be the

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,680
full increase and the huge increase in

183
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
in the expected loss and the system loss

184
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
if we have real world

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
assets that actually

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
worth millions if compromised

187
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,039
but actually the need for the mechanism

188
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
design is twofold

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
the first reason that i just have

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
mentioned the effect of behavioral bias

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,720
that

192
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
sense behavioral defenders invest in a

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
sub-optimal manner and the second is

194
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
that even if the defenders are rational

195
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,160
they actually will invest in a selfish

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
manner each one will only care about

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
defending hair sub network

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
therefore we need central agency

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
investments or sales or that to lead

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
ideally to social optimal which is

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
surely better because it will lead to

202
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
essential cost and we proved in the

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,000
paper compared to selfish investments

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,599
so there are such questions we need to

205
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,800
answer can we design a mechanism that

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
help the defenders or incentivize the

207
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
defenders to invest in a better manner

208
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,840
to protect their systems and the whole

209
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,120
systems and make it more skewed

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
and actually the idea here is to do

211
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
to for the central authority to guide

212
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,240
the behavior defenders and we build on

213
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
text-based mechanisms and adapted for

214
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
security of interdependent systems

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
simply our setup is that the cost of

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,199
each defender is the original cost plus

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
attacks and these tax or term tk in the

218
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
security tax which is collected by the

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,319
central agents and we adapted two

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,759
mechanisms the externality and vcg

221
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
and also as i will explain later for

222
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,399
these two mechanisms and the effect of

223
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,719
bias on security tax amount we expose

224
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,240
that as well

225
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
and actually one other motivation for

226
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,039
our proposal that

227
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
cyber insurance is a very promising

228
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,040
direction so because the government can

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
make participation in cyber insurance a

230
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,040
requisite for the companies to receive

231
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
security funding and help them in their

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,839
business opportunities and there are

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
several proposals in the direction for

234
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,160
example the california proposal for

235
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
mandatory cyber insurance in that

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
and this central mechanism has several

237
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
properties but you are focusing on one

238
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
main property which is which budget

239
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
balance property

240
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
recall that ti is the security tax paid

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,160
by the stakeholder or defender di and n

242
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
if the total number of the defenders in

243
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
the network so we aim for wpb or we

244
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
budget balance which is the summation

245
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
all of the taxes made by all defenders

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,839
should be non-negative because if that

247
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
doesn't hold we will have a budget

248
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
deficit case

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
in which actually the mechanism would

250
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
require the mechanism designer or the

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
central agency to go and

252
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
take money

253
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,399
from her bucket and use or and spend it

254
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,160
which is actually external resources

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
which is not deserved and doesn't make

256
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
sense

257
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
so now i will uh focus my attention on

258
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,399
the externality mechanisms and how we

259
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
adapted to our problem

260
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
so actually the idea here of the

261
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
externality mechanism that

262
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
for each age if one defender invests on

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
my age i will my cost would be affected

264
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,959
by that so the taxes would be

265
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,440
depending on such externality which is

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,760
how much my cost as defender decay

267
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,839
decreased or increased depending on that

268
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
investments and therefore the total tax

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
would be simply

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
like summation over all of the

271
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,320
externalities by all defenders on my

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
network so the simple intuition for such

273
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
externality mechanism that each defender

274
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
will pay a tax amount and this tax

275
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,200
amount is proportional to how much i

276
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
gain or what is the positive externality

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
that i will gain or my cost will

278
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,920
decrease depending on other defenders

279
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
investments or my ages which is my

280
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
network

281
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
also we explore the effect of behavioral

282
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
bias on taxes

283
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
we prove that under

284
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,839
the externality mechanism the amount of

285
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
taxes uh actually made by the defender

286
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
is a decreasing function in here

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,240
behavior level also in other words the

288
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
behavioral defender will pay more taxes

289
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
compared to a rational defender

290
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,519
the intuition for that that the

291
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,640
behavioral defender will see a different

292
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
drop or higher drop in her perceived

293
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
loss or cost due to

294
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
cities from other defenders which would

295
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,320
encourage him or her to pay more taxes

296
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
the second and the more popular one we

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
adapted is the physician mechanism

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,320
actually the idea of c v

299
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,560
mechanisms depending on how i benefit

300
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,519
that's the society so here if x star

301
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
minus k is the equilibrium by all

302
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
defenders excluding dk and x-bar is the

303
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
equilibrium by all defenders including

304
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
dk the tax would be assembly the social

305
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
cost of others

306
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
excluding me minus the social cost of

307
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
others

308
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
excluding me but this one with my

309
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
investments and this one without my

310
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,200
investments so just

311
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,600
to go like similar without any math like

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,240
complexity the idea is that if the

313
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
defender decays investments make my

314
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
system worse then the tax amount would

315
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
be both of them in other words the

316
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,279
mechanism would have a penalty of the

317
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,160
defender because you made the society

318
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
more or less secure with more costs but

319
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,880
on the other hand if the defender

320
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,519
investments make the system better or

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,240
make the system with less social cost

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
the taxes would be negative

323
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,079
and therefore

324
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,959
actually the tax will reward you and the

325
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,880
defender will receive a reward for

326
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,519
enhancing our society by reducing the

327
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,600
social cost

328
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
so based on such setup and two

329
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,839
mechanisms we adapted for our problem

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,079
and the properties we proved now we go

331
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,240
to the evaluation our evaluation try to

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,560
answer these questions first what's the

333
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
gain of using mechanism design for

334
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,880
helping behavioral defenders to achieve

335
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,600
social optimal and second

336
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
how does the level of behavioral bias

337
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,160
affect the outcomes of our mechanisms

338
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
are

339
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
so to answer these two questions we

340
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
evaluate our approach using four attack

341
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
graphs based on real-world attack

342
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,279
scenarios and actually these scenarios

343
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,720
were built

344
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,760
using

345
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,320
like well defined standards such as the

346
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
nest guidelines and nesco guidelines

347
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
first we show the superiority of social

348
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
optimal over selfish investments or bme

349
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,880
as shown here the social cost under

350
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,600
social uh under social optimal solution

351
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,839
or sell or defense or

352
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
mechanism design or

353
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,120
social defense is actually much lower

354
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
compared to the social cost under

355
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,279
selfish investment especially with

356
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,360
behavioral defenders because each one

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
will be selfish and also waste his

358
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
resources

359
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
one other thing we observe that the

360
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,279
difference actually between these social

361
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,000
costs is higher as you see here the

362
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,519
dissociation cost is much higher

363
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
compared to the social optimal

364
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
especially with systems with high degree

365
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
of interdependency such as the scada

366
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
system

367
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,760
next we show the amount of taxes for

368
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
each mechanism so

369
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
to begin with the physician mechanism

370
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
each player will receive a payment or

371
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
pay negative taxes because it will help

372
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,360
and contribute to enhancing the society

373
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
cost

374
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
on the other hand the externality

375
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
mechanism each defender will benefit and

376
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,839
therefore each defender will pay

377
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,800
positive investments or balance however

378
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,959
in both of these scenarios

379
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,440
actually we show in our evaluation that

380
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
the amount of taxes increases and the

381
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,519
defenders has more bias or become more

382
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,760
behavioral

383
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
finally we also show the superiority of

384
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
the sheriff of our baselines so we

385
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
compare our approach to sharok with four

386
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
biz life approaches and the russian

387
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
decision making and we can create the

388
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
social cost under each build line

389
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,560
defense allocation as shown here

390
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,279
we we have four systems distributed

391
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,199
energy resource failure scenarios scada

392
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,360
control system ecommerce and voice over

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,720
ib and as shown here our approached

394
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,519
shahrukh has superiority or lowest

395
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,399
social cost compared to all of these

396
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
seminal baselines

397
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
just to conclude by talk we first

398
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,240
adapted to text-based mechanisms for our

399
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
general framework this framework

400
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,120
involves attack graph models that model

401
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,519
large-scale interdependent systems that

402
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
have multiple defenders

403
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
and each human defender in these

404
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,759
entertainment systems misreceived the

405
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,480
risk on each agent the attack graph

406
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
and also we proved the impossibility

407
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
result that there is no guarantee of

408
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
free budget balance in our

409
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
interdependent security game but more

410
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
details can be found

411
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,600
in the paper

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and finally we characterize the impact

413
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,399
of such misperceptions on tax maybe

414
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,399
payments made by each defender

415
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
we believe that our work will

416
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
help to build better mechanisms and

417
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
build better and implement better

418
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,440
security bonuses that can be applied to

419
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,839
enhance the two issues i have mentioned

420
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,160
in the beginning of my talk thank you

421
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,680
and i'm happy to have any questions

422
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
okay the perfect

423
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,240
author is on zoom so if there is any

424
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
question from the audience

425
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,639
feel free to

426
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,680
no questions

427
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,880
so i will ask one of mine

428
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
uh i was with if i thank you for the

429
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,839
this very interesting introducing topic

430
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,759
i was uh wondering if you give some can

431
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,040
give more insight of this um cyber

432
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,639
insurance that you are mentioning

433
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,839
because i understand the concept of

434
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,320
taxes and everything

435
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,480
in practice in real life

436
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,359
yes

437
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
thanks for the question

438
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,880
so actually the idea of uh having like

439
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
having our idea badminton and cyber

440
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
insurance in general is like to have uh

441
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,400
generally instituted the taxes being

442
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
just collected collected uh based on

443
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,080
like the social cost or the behavior

444
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
which leads to the security investments

445
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
it will just be something like bid up

446
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
front so i will

447
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,880
in the beginning the

448
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
the the company or the center company or

449
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,320
central agency will collect some like

450
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
pro amounts and

451
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,320
based on that i will transfer my risk to

452
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,160
here so that so

453
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,799
for example if my system is compromised

454
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,440
as like a stakeholder or as like a sub

455
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
company or even a company the the

456
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,559
central agency or the

457
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,919
the government

458
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,400
agency will pay such like

459
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,799
part of all of these security law system

460
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,640
but actually in the our current setup in

461
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
the paper we don't consider cyber

462
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,559
insurance so consider that

463
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
we will try to collaborate

464
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,960
and each one

465
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,440
make better security policies and based

466
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,080
on such policies we will

467
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,320
pay taxes or receive rewards from the

468
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
central regulator based on our behavior

469
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
or in other words our security

470
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
investments or security bonuses so

471
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
that's the difference between just

472
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
collecting taxation based on

473
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,960
uh the

474
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,600
behavior or the cyber insurance which is

475
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
mainly uh similar to the idea of the

476
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
insurance but your the the agency will

477
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,080
take the money up front and based on

478
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
that

479
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,679
like if my if my system is compromised

480
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,960
she will like hold like she will like

481
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,280
hold or pay some of the amounts or all

482
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
of the security losses that i wouldn't

483
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
have so like this like these two uh

484
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
ideas i think uh both of them are

485
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,760
applicable as i mentioned there are

486
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
several proposals and even several

487
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,720
several initial solutions for that uh

488
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
cyber insurance idea but so i think that

489
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
that would be like a very interesting uh

490
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,160
like extension though to our current

491
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
work

492
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,120
thank you so we have another question

493
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
yeah so i was wondering how exactly the

494
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
graph was constructed like it seems like

495
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
different companies have or defenders

496
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
have different ideas of

497
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
what their personal cost of not getting

498
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,720
attacked and what the attack

499
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
probabilities of successful attacks are

500
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,320
so how do you like build the graph

501
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
yes

502
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,039
thanks for the question so i actually

503
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,640
the idea for the

504
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,799
graph generation we try to see what are

505
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,480
all of the possible

506
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
like um

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
what's the possible attack scenarios

508
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,480
based on each like failure scenario so

509
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
we had like four like practical systems

510
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,799
which are the distributed energy

511
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,720
resource failure scenario the scada

512
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
control system the e-commerce and voice

513
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,080
over ib for each one we'll try we start

514
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
with some like well-known failure

515
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,919
scenarios and based on

516
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,440
these failure scenarios we will come up

517
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
with some like

518
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,200
a tech graph or graph that represents

519
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
such attack scenarios and for the

520
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,799
probability estimation or the

521
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,720
probability of attack default

522
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
probability of attack estimation or the

523
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,559
vulnerability estimation with we

524
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,640
followed actually the cve the common

525
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
vulnerability exposure database so based

526
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
on that each edge should represent an

527
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,120
attack we try to like

528
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,679
come up based on on this attack and

529
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,720
several factors in this like cve

530
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,799
database you can come up with some like

531
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,640
estimation what would be the probability

532
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,400
of the initial probability of attack

533
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,559
without any defense so based on that we

534
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
try to like

535
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
estimate the initial problems of attack

536
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,440
for each

537
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,679
thank you but surely that estimation may

538
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,039
not be like

539
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
it may not be the

540
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,080
the

541
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
i mean exactly the same as the province

542
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
of attack but that's one one idea would

543
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,679
try to like map david

544
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,919
like databases availability database to

545
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,240
use it to like come up with the initial

546
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,960
probabilities

547
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,240
one last question

548
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,679
okay we have one last question good

549
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,280
hi yeah that was a very interesting

550
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
presentation um i was wondering uh if

551
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
you consider this uh also low

552
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
probability events with catastrophic

553
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,520
failures you were mentioning that scada

554
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
systems are very interdependent but i

555
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
think another difference is that they

556
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
have this

557
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,559
basically rare events the black swan

558
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,880
events that are like occur maybe might

559
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
they might not occur in our lifetime

560
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
maybe they will maybe this only one is

561
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
like earthquakes right only one thing

562
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,960
and then

563
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
how the hell so how do you handle those

564
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
cases

565
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,720
yes uh thanks for that so actually we um

566
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,360
so uh all of that should like

567
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
be reflected in the initial probability

568
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
of attack estimation or even

569
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
regenerating maybe the attack graph but

570
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,679
actually like for

571
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,559
for our uh for our any for our current

572
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,960
work we don't have like

573
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
like variable uh variable probability or

574
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,240
estimation of the probabilities but we

575
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400
try to in our model incorporate

576
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,320
something called sensitivity so this

577
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,880
sensitivity tries to like

578
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,080
like uh

579
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,360
also

580
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,960
shows how the defense can like how the

581
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,840
security of this age or the security of

582
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,799
our like nodes can be changed according

583
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,480
to like our risk so for example if if a

584
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
an edge that has a very real

585
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
attack probability

586
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
will have two things the first one is

587
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,080
that

588
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,440
the probability of the initial

589
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,880
probability of attack we estimate would

590
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,159
be very low

591
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,760
and the second one

592
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
or the second thing we incorporated in

593
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
our model that the sensitivity of this

594
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,039
edge will also be like um

595
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,440
will be very high because like

596
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,240
if this is like almost very secure we

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
don't have to like add more resources on

598
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,600
that

599
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
on that edge up front so but but

600
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
generally i think that estimation will

601
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,400
be generally based on this initial

602
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,240
probability of successful attack because

603
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
as as i mentioned in the beginning of

604
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,039
the talk how we buy how our buyers can

605
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,880
affect that because i think that maybe

606
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
also

607
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,559
more extensions or more

608
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,120
trying to explore more what is exactly

609
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,679
the difference um between the low the

610
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,120
low probability

611
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
risk and high probability rest because

612
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,279
according to prospect theory like the

613
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,120
like generally we as humans we

614
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,600
overweight rare risks which is

615
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,039
overweight low probabilities and

616
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,600
underweight like high probabilities so

617
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
with we try to focus more in this paper

618
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
on the high attack probabilities or the

619
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
pro the

620
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
the higher risk but also i think our

621
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,880
framework like can can handle such other

622
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,279
cases but maybe more detailed like

623
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,000
analysis for seeing what or what would

624
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
be does it worth it like to spend more

625
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
resources on that or

626
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,679
like or

627
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
how much uh a budget should be allocated

628
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,559
to such ages like more detailed like

629
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
explanations i think that would be very

630
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,320
interesting like extension to our book

631
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
thank you very much for answering those

632
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,360
questions

633
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
and that concludes the

634
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
well we can thank so sorry we can thanks

635
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,039
again the author for

636
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,799
his presentation thank you
