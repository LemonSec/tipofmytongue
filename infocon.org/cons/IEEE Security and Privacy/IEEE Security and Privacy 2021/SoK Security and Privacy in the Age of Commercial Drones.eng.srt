00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,600
hello

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,279
and welcome to my talk security and

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,160
privacy in the age of commercial drones

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,639
this is a joint work ordered by venezie

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,679
juan viton

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,920
rio masuka asap shaptai and yuval

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
alovich

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,840
okay so let's start to discuss about

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,920
drones and drone technology has advanced

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,800
significantly in recent years

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,680
and also legislation and regulations are

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
evolving to allow rooms

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,760
to fly in populated areas for commercial

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
use

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,239
moreover drone shipments are expected to

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,320
increase significantly in the next

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
few years and the area in which drones

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,600
will

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,559
start to fill the sky is approaching

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,360
however we

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,760
ask a different type of question how

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
will the new era

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,879
affect security and privacy

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,039
so uh in order to understand the

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,360
motivation to explore security and

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
privacy

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,399
uh let's analyze what we've learned over

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
the last 10 years about drones

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,479
and security and privacy so first of all

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,000
the security of drones

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
uh can be leveraged by businesses for

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
legitimate purposes

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
however it can also be exploited by

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,600
malicious entities from various

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
malicious activities and i think that

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,759
you will agree with me that there is a

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,320
need

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
to secure drones from malicious entities

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,080
as well as

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
uh there's a need to secure society from

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
malicious activity conducted

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
by clerks

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
now in this study we focused on a

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
primary research question

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
has the technology needed to protect

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
drones and society from one another

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,920
matured enough to handle the upcoming

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
challenges and in order to answer it we

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,000
actually

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,880
uh define two secondary research

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,079
questions which are

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,159
are drones and their ecosystems

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
protected against attacks performed by

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,520
malicious entities

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
and the second one is is society

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,159
protected against attacks conducted

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
using drones now previous studies have

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,320
already appealed

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
this domain however we consider them

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,360
narrow

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
in scope and also they lack a systematic

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
approach for structuring

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
existing knowledge on drones and society

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
as a result there's a scientific gap

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
previous studies do not answer the

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
primary research question

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,440
and previous studies do not point

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
to the scientific gaps which should be

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
addressed

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
in this research we cover multiple

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
sectors um

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
we expose security and privacy from two

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,319
perspective which is the drones and

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,080
society

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
we develop a methodology and define

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
assessment criteria for reviewing

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,360
and structuring the existing knowledge

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
and finally we make holistic conclusions

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
that take both entities into account

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
now this research covers commercial

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
drones

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
and the technological needs required to

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
protect drones and society from one

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,239
another

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,840
are non-commercial drones and

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,680
non-technological needs are outside the

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
scope of this

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
research now

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,959
in the first part we try to answer our

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,560
drones that to answer the following

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,280
questions

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,879
and following question are drones and

93
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
their ecosystems protected against

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
attacks performed by malicious centers

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
so the first thing that we did is we

96
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,159
tried to identify the target we had to

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,200
enumerate them

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
and the drones ecosystem is comprised of

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
six

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,280
final targets which are the drones

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,799
chassis and package

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
the dome hardware uh the gun control

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,239
system

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,680
which is used to control uh the drone by

105
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040
the pilot

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
the first person view channel which is

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
the radio communication channel between

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
the drone and the gun control system

109
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,720
the pilot and the cloud servants

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
and regarding that industry profile we

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,519
assume that the attacker is any civilian

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,760
with the malicious intention to destruct

113
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,599
the legitimate task of flying drone

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
and we also assume that

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,799
the capabilities that the attacker have

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
is uh basically any equipment

117
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,439
that can be legally purchased with a few

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,159
thousand

119
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
dollars uh this includes sdl

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
it includes a computer a commercial

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,600
laser etc

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
now laser cannons and radio cannons and

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
predator birds

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,880
are weapons that the typical civilian

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
cannot obtain in the outside scope of

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
this fund

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
now in order to analyze the attacks

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,840
against drones uh we define

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
four assistant criteria which includes

130
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,919
the operational range

131
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,520
how close should the attacker do to the

132
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
drone the impact which is

133
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
what factor was violated the exposure

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,759
level which how fundamental is the

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,560
attack

136
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
and the complexity of the data

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
now we review each and every known

138
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,520
method

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,039
uh against uh uh each and every

140
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,840
uh attack method against a drone and we

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,960
map them

142
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,880
to the targets and we analyze them

143
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,639
according to the assistant criteria that

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,919
i previously

145
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
presented and in order to complete

146
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,039
the picture we also review

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
uh counter measures and again we define

148
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,320
assessment criteria for the

149
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
countermeasures

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,919
for example the type of security which

151
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,240
is prevention mitigation detection

152
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
or response uh the technological

153
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
readiness of the confirmation for

154
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,360
example

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
um and um other examples of the resource

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
overhead

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,639
and the maintenance required and the

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
changes to infrastructure

159
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,199
and again we analyze each and every

160
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,199
known counter measure

161
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,000
that can be used to prevent or mitigate

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
the attacks against drones

163
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
and we analyze them according to the uh

164
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,960
criteria that we find

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
and this helped us to have a broader

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
picture of

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,520
uh attacks and conquer measures against

168
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,639
drones

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,319
now based on this analysis uh we try to

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
find what is a severe attack or in our

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,800
conflict

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,600
scientific gap now is

173
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
and a target can be applied by a remote

174
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,000
attacker against the flight grown from

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
a medium range of at least 15 meters and

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,919
doesn't have

177
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,880
an effective counter measure and based

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
on this criteria we found

179
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
there are four methods that uh we

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,319
consider them

181
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,039
as severe attacks against drones for

182
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,120
example gps spoofing

183
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
and gps jamming that threatens

184
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,560
autonomous navigation and fpv channel

185
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,919
journey which threatens

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
a remote control navigation and also

187
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
there is um

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,440
a method that we presented two years ago

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,319
which allows the factory to extract the

190
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,400
biggest important point of interest

191
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
and this can be prevented but again with

192
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,240
a cost

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,960
that um should be paid in order to um

194
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,240
mitigate to prevent this attack

195
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,360
and the main conclusion that we uh made

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
is that drones and the ecosystems aren't

197
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,520
yet adequately protected

198
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,759
commercial drones that are used to

199
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,039
transport organs

200
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
to hospitals in our days for

201
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,199
transplantation

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
are exposed to severe attacks that can

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,000
be performed with inexpensive

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
easily procured equipment

205
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,880
and we define we actually uh suggest

206
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
future research directions including for

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,759
example examining

208
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,319
the aspect of attacking radiation how to

209
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,919
enter a drone during the afternoon

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,720
attack

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
and countermeasures for cyber attacks

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,720
against internet connected drones

213
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
uh which the next generation of drones

214
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
will be connected directly to the

215
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,000
internet

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
and not via the smartphone of the

217
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
comfortable system

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
now in the second part we try to answer

219
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,080
um

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
the following question is society

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
protected against

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,720
attacks conducted using drones and again

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
we identified three types of targets

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,759
which

225
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
are individuals organizations and

226
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,319
national facilities

227
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
and in this part we consider uh

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,320
the adversary as any pilot who uses a

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,799
drone

230
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,719
in order to violate the security and

231
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,719
privacy of either individuals

232
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,839
organizations

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
or niche or nations

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,599
and we identify four primary types of

235
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
threats against the targets which

236
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,160
includes

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
um spying cyber attack that can be used

238
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
that can be applied via drones terrorism

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
attacks

240
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,279
and also smuggling

241
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
now in order to analyze counter measure

242
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,399
against

243
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,399
these threats we define uh

244
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
assessment criterias which includes the

245
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,839
operational range again the

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,959
technological

247
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,000
readiness of the counter measure its

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
operation level

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,680
its cost its effectiveness and

250
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
performance

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
and based on this criteria we decided to

252
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
try to analyze the counter measure and

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
their effectiveness

254
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
however preventing the implementation of

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
attacks conducted using drones requires

256
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,920
a three-step process the first step

257
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,000
includes detection which is identifying

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
the presence of

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
suspicious drone in space now

260
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
we analyze each and every known method

261
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,360
um with the criteria that

262
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
we previously defined

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
and as you can see there are various

264
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
sensors that can be used to detect the

265
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
presence of a drone with

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,800
each have advantages and disadvantages

267
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
um we also uh the second step

268
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,320
is uh consists of assessment which

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
is determining whether the drone is

270
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,360
hostile or not

271
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
and in this case as you can see there

272
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
are few methods that they

273
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,200
use to assess the uh

274
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,600
the intention of the drone and basically

275
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,560
whether the drone is hostile or not

276
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
and finally there is the introduction

277
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,079
which our networks

278
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
use to disable goal and again we

279
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,079
analyzed them according to their

280
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,760
assessment criteria

281
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
now this is what we found this is what

282
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,519
we concluded uh national facilities are

283
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,600
primarily

284
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
susceptible to terrorism and smuggling

285
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,800
um

286
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
and detection can be achieved using

287
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
hybrid methods and

288
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
assessment methods in this case aren't

289
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,880
required

290
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
because these facilities are considered

291
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
no flight areas so you don't need to

292
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
understand whether

293
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,480
a detector drone is hostile or not any

294
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,519
drone flying

295
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,279
um over a national facility which is

296
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,480
considered first time

297
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,040
and as a result we concluded that given

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,959
that national facilities are isolated

299
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,800
and usually have the budget required to

300
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,519
purchase

301
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
the dedicated mechanism needed they can

302
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
be secured against

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
hostile governments now for

304
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,079
organizations

305
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,600
uh organizations that are nearly

306
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
susceptible to cyber attacks

307
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,079
uh however detection assessment and

308
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,120
prediction methods

309
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
aren't needed to mitigate cyber attacks

310
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
this can uh this type of attacks can be

311
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,279
mitigated in traditional countermeasures

312
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
against cyber attacks um

313
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
and as a result we concluded

314
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,880
organization and companies

315
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,040
are adequately protected against cyber

316
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
attacks conducted by drones if they

317
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,760
deploy

318
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
um dedicated countermeasure measures

319
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,200
against

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
cyber attacks finally for individuals

321
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
um for individuals the case is a bit

322
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,480
different

323
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,279
individuals are mainly susceptible to

324
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
spine

325
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
um detection method intended for

326
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
consumer use hasn't

327
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
yet uh has yet to be developed and also

328
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
this is the case for assessment

329
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,519
assessment method that is

330
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,440
intended for consumer use has also yet

331
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
to be developed and as a result we

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
concluded that individuals

333
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
aren't adequately protected against

334
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,839
drones used for spine and this includes

335
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,200
inner slimming and

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
tracking um

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
we suggested few research directions

338
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
included developing detection tracking

339
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
and assessment methods intended for

340
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,040
consumers

341
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,200
now finally in the last part we're

342
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
trying to answer the primary

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
research question has the technology

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
needed to protect drones in society from

345
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,639
one another matured enough to handle the

346
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,360
challenges

347
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
that the large volume of flights will

348
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
create and the main conclusion that we

349
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
made is that the technology required to

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,480
secure drones

351
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
and society for one another and enable

352
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959
safe and responsible deployment of

353
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,079
drones

354
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,680
hasn't yet been developed and

355
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
an immediate question that arises is in

356
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,120
theory

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
can both entities which are drones and

358
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,639
society achieve

359
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
a perfect level of security and privacy

360
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
in parallel and here is

361
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,440
an interesting conclusion that we made

362
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
there's a trade-off between the security

363
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
and privacy of drones

364
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
and security of privacy of society the

365
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
security and privacy of drones cannot be

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,959
optimized without decreasing the

367
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,880
security of privacy of society and vice

368
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,839
versa

369
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
think about the countermeasure to

370
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
prevent

371
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
gps proofing for example it will

372
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
increase the security of drones

373
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
however you will have one less method

374
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
that can be used

375
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,160
to disable a hostile drone

376
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
now this situation is similar to

377
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,519
cryptography where there's a trade-off

378
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360
between public safety and preserving

379
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
data confidentiality in this case

380
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,800
and the technology and

381
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
instead we suggest finding a reasonable

382
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,160
balance

383
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,760
between the level of security and

384
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
privacy of drone society

385
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
and by examining whether the balance has

386
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
been achieved

387
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,279
uh this can be served as the basis of

388
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,800
criteria for the safe

389
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,639
and responsible deployment of drones

390
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
i want to thank you for attending this

391
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
talk and i will take

392
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
questions thank you once again
