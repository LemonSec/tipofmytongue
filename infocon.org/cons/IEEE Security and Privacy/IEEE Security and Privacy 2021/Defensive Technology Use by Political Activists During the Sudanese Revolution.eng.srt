00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,699
Hi everyone, my name is Alaa Daffalla and
I’m going to be presenting this work that

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:09,020
I did along with Lucy Simko and both of our
advisors, Alexandru Bardas and yoshi kohno

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,410
on the defensive practices of political activists
during the 2018-2019 political revolution

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,160
in Sudan.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,550
In the past decade, there have been a number
of protest movements advocating for human

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,149
rights and political change around the world.
In 2011, the series of protests that swept

7
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,500
through the Middle East and North Africa,
known as Arab Spring, became some of the first

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,940
political movements to leverage the power
of social media as an organizational tool.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,820
We believe that political activism is important
to study because of its historic role in bringing

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,789
about increased justice and equity in the
world and because it can involve regular people

11
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,859
directly facing a powerful nation-state adversary.
In this paper, we study the Sudanese revolution,

12
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:58,749
which erupted at the end of 2018, and led
to a transitional civilian-military government

13
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:01,030
that is currently in rule

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,550
Here, we provide more background information
on the Sudanese revolution and the timeline

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:13,470
of events leading to that. In December of
2018 anti-government protests erupted in Atbara.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,340
Within days demonstrations were held in most
cities around the countries and an umbrella

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,950
organization called the Sudanese professionals
Association emerged as a leader of the movement

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,270
at the time. Following that the movement evolved
to become more organized and structured with

19
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,360
neighborhood resistance committees being formed.
During that time, there has been occasional

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,130
social media blockades where access to certain
apps and services was curtailed. This continued

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,030
up to the deposition of the president in April
and a peaceful sit-in followed were people

22
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,420
gathered in a massive protest scene in-front
of the military headquarters. In June 2019

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,250
there was a complete internet blackout that
continued for more than a month before the

24
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,810
transitional civilian military government
was formed

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,890
With this backdrop information, we formulate
the following research questions, first we

26
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,280
wanted to know what threats were the activists
facing? We can’t know exactly what the government

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,240
was capable of, or what they did, in some
cases, but it is important to understand the

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,560
activists’ threat models since those shaped
their practices.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,890
Second, we wanted to know about how they protected
themselves, whether their practices felt sufficient,

30
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,489
and the challenges they encountered with technology.

31
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,660
And, finally, we wanted to know how activists
adopted new technologies, behaviors, or mental

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,820
models, and how that knowledge spread within
the community.

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,319
Stepping back, we also use the answers to
these questions to draw lessons for the future

34
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,200
security and privacy researchers and technologists
about the political and societal factors that

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,290
influenced activists’ technology use, and
about certain tensions or design principles

36
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,150
that arise from our findings.

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,850
To answer these questions we decided to conduct
semi-structured interviews. We first received

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,120
IRB approval for our study at both institutions.
Because this is a sensitive and potentially

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,780
dangerous topic for participants, we thought
carefully about how to best protect participants.

40
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,120
Our guiding principles were that we should
not collect or store more personal information

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,630
than we needed, and that we should follow
participants’ leads with respect to what

42
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,049
they were comfortable sharing, what technology
they wanted to use, and what information they

43
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,330
wanted to give about themselves. We recruited
13 participants.

44
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,459
Our interviews were remote and most of our
participants agreed on being recorded and

45
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,910
preferred audio only calls over video. 5 interviews
were in Arabic, and 8 were in English. We

46
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,319
recorded, translated, and transcribed all
interviews.

47
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,030
We then developed a qualitative codebook through
an iterative coding process. Two researchers

48
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,550
then applied the codebook to each interview

49
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,170
While there are some ethical concerns on whether
the publication of these results could harm

50
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,458
the efforts of future activists we argue that
it is unreasonable to expect that all future

51
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,620
activists will be technically sophisticated.
However, it is reasonable to expect that nation

52
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,230
states will have technical sophistication.
Thus, we believe that while the findings in

53
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,099
this paper can contribute to the creation
of technologies to empower future activists,

54
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:23,919
we do not believe that our findings go beyond
what a sophisticated nation state could deduce.

55
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,090
To understand more about why activists adopted
the security practices and behaviors that

56
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,270
they did, in this slide we present the most
common threats that activists faced and what

57
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,639
were their security goals. The threat of arrest
and physical device seizure was the most common

58
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,300
threat experienced by those we talked to.
Once arrested, phones were confiscated and

59
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,639
activists were forced to unlock their phones
and sometimes forced to log in to their social

60
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,770
media accounts. An arrest of one person could
be a trigger for a chain of arrests in that

61
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,270
person’s network.

62
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,758
The second threat is the threat of electronic
or physical surveillance. Most participants

63
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,289
believed that regular phone calls and SMS
messages were monitored due to the control

64
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,180
that the governemnt has over the telecommunications
infrastructure and companies.

65
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,379
The third threat was the threat of misinformation
& propaganda. Online misinformation was rampant

66
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:18,780
during the revolution and it usually spread
from online accounts known as “electronic

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,520
chickens”. And it included fake news, false
reports about deaths at protests, or false

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,359
protests’ times and locations

69
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,639
The fourth threat that activists faced was
the threat of censorship or disrupted access

70
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,729
to social media apps/services or the internet.

71
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,740
Activists’ also had a number of security
goals in place given the threats they faced:

72
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,469
The first goal was to provide plausible deniability
during protests and upon arrest. Second, they

73
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:49,430
wanted to ensure the security of their online
communications and prevent misinformation,

74
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,150
third they wanted to stay secure from being
physically targeted and finally they wanted

75
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,589
to ensure the availability and security of
their communications during two important

76
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,310
phases of the revolution (the social media
blockade and the internet blackout)

77
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,189
In the next few slides we will go through
the security practices and behaviors that

78
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,580
activists adopted in order to achieve these
goals.

79
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,039
Manual message deletion was among the most
popular practices that activists adopted to

80
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:22,490
sanitize their devices and hence provide plausible
deniability upon arrest. People deleted messages

81
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,580
on their phones before going to protests and
expected others in their group to do the same.

82
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,080
They also sanitized their online presence
and information that would be available in

83
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,830
their online accounts. So activists decided
that because they would be forced to give

84
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,748
up their passcodes upon arrest, the best course
of action was to simply delete any messages

85
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,659
from other activists.

86
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,069
In this second quote here the participant
mentions that the phone is 100% sanitized

87
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,919
before the protest time

88
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,359
When trying to look at the political influence
that shaped the activists’ practices of

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,939
message deletion we find that one factor is
that: the right to privacy is defined differently

90
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:05,460
around the world, and it affects what technology
someone is going to use (or not use) to protect

91
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,539
themselves. This first quote is from one of
the participants recounting their arrest.

92
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:14,289
They’re talking about how the police forced
them to unlock their phone, but they were

93
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:21,279
so confident that they wrote down the passcode
for them -- and it worked, they never figured

94
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,560
out who they really were. In the US, domestic
arrestees are protected by the 5th Amendment

95
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,729
from being compelled to give a passcode. Android
and iOS support American users by providing

96
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,998
a quick way to force passcode authentication
over biometric

97
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:39,789
Authentication but users in Sudan, or any
other country where the right to privacy upon

98
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,430
arrest is defined differently, are not.

99
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,059
Another political influence is that participants
believed that the Sudanese government could

100
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:53,159
conduct mass surveillance, and that SMS in
particular was unsafe due to being unencrypted.

101
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,169
So -- users’ beliefs about what their government
can do, both legally and practically, to surveil

102
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:03,779
them, is a driving factor of adoption (or
non-adoption).

103
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,058
There were additional societal influences
impacting activists’ adoption choices for

104
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:13,879
example group adoption was a challenge. Participants
told us that digital and security literacy

105
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,029
of others in the group was a barrier to app
adoption -- this quote is about wanting to

106
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,308
communicate with someone on a platform that
the other person already knows because you

107
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:29,870
can trust that they’ll actually use it properly
as opposed to a new app/technology

108
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,269
Other practices for phone sanitization do
appear in the paper

109
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:40,219
Furthermore, and to provide plausible deniability
upon arrest activists had a number of strategies

110
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:47,769
for data hiding. More details about these
practices can also be found on our paper

111
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,720
To ensure the security of their online communications,
activists used foreign numbers as a second

112
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,810
factor of authentication. Participants felt
safer with a second factor number outside

113
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,410
the US, and this quote is from someone in
particular who felt safer with a number from

114
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,699
a country whose government did not support
the outgoing Sudanese government. It says:

115
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:06,699
“Your twitter phone number has to be outside
Sudan, and it has to be in a country that’s

116
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,459
not compromised by twitter.” So there were
three ways that participants configured 2FA

117
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,660
using a foreign number

118
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,389
First, if they had a friend, family member,
or someone else outside of the country, that

119
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,170
person might be able to add their number onto
the activist’s online social media accounts.

120
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,449
Second, some created fake US numbers online
through a “phone service in an app provider”,

121
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,410
thinking that this would provide privacy by
not going through the Sudanese telephone network,

122
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,110
but relying on the security of the app provider
and depending on the internet availability.

123
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,579
And, the third strategy was obtaining a foreign
SIM card and using it on roaming

124
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,489
Participants felt that network traffic in
Sudan that went through a foreign SIM would

125
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,209
be safer than the same traffic going through
a Sudanese SIM card; though it depends on

126
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:54,319
technical and political specifics, we are
unsure whether the foreign SIM gave them the

127
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:58,290
privacy and security guarantees that they
thought they had.

128
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,930
So, moving on from the mechanics of how this
happened and the technical threat models,

129
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,420
let’s think about WHY.

130
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,829
First, international sanctions prevent the
use of local numbers for authentication on

131
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:21,589
Twitter and similar social media platforms
(read first quote). So, we think it is important

132
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,250
to consider what features and technologies
are available in a region in case of sanctions

133
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,379
or restrictions, because those can shape strategies
and behaviors.

134
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,120
So another political factor in this threat
model is the degree of legal control and access

135
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,209
that governments have over telecommunication
infrastructure and companies.

136
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,319
In addition, the motivations and capabilities
of foreign governments that might be helping

137
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:47,910
the adversary influences the choice of foreign
number for authentication. For example in

138
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,100
this bottom quote here the participant stresses
that the foreign number used has to be something

139
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,459
in Europe

140
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,819
We also find that a societal characteristic
of the Sudanese community: which is the robust

141
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:05,969
network of the Sudanese diaspora enabled 2FA
using a foreign number for activists in the

142
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,490
ground. Most of our participants had friends
or family abroad who could enable this SMS

143
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,490
authentication

144
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,519
To prevent online misinformation activists
relied on a number of manual heuristics searching

145
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,649
through unknown online profiles to identify
patterns of fake news or suspicious handles.

146
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,550
For example one participant here explains
one of their heuristics

147
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,990
In addition, the Sudanese diaspora formed
a content moderation team on social media,

148
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:40,370
taking shifts and reporting and questioning
suspicious online accounts. This ad hoc, organically

149
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,350
crowdsourced, and effective content moderation
team may suggest that crowdsourcing and self-moderation

150
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,430
can be effective within activist communities.

151
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,739
We also note that establishing trusted sources
was of utmost importance to prevent online

152
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,900
misinformation. Activists built networks of
contacts to enable them to get news from a

153
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,139
trusted first-hand source with the root source
of trust being an in-person meeting. This

154
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,860
network was sometimes multiple layers deep
so that it would be harder for an adversarial

155
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,930
observer to trace through the network between
the sources and the destination

156
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,859
Activists had different strategies in place
to maintain physical security and that is

157
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,860
camouflaging their activities, planning escape
routes and surveying the area. There was also

158
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,721
a public discourse on best protest practices
in terms of what color of clothes to wear

159
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:32,680
and how to protest in groups or pairs and
knowing when to run.

160
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,029
During the internet blackout most people didn’t
have internet access and this prevented people

161
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,850
from accessing the internet and talking over
encrypted messaging apps.

162
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,819
So, mesh networking apps are an example of
a strategy that did NOT work for participants.

163
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:50,790
This quote is talking about an app called
Firechat that a few participants mentioned,

164
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,550
but they said it didn’t work for them. So
this person started to develop their own mesh

165
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,508
networking app to fill the gap.

166
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,970
Participants explained why the mesh networking
apps they tried to use didn’t work for them.

167
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,100
One issue was usability and functionality,
as you can see in this quote when the participant

168
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,269
says, “people couldn’t make it work. It
didn’t even join those who were in close

169
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,110
proximity to each other.”

170
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,450
Moreover, mesh networking chat applications
suffer from the problem of group adoption—they

171
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,759
are not useful until reaching a critical mass
of users, and until then, users decide not

172
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,670
to adopt them, preventing a critical mass.

173
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,199
One solution might be to suggest to that people
should pre-download mesh networking apps.

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,240
Another solution might be that popular messaging
apps should add support for mesh networking.

175
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,199
However we acknowledge that this suggestion
might be in tension with the needs of other

176
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,690
groups who could prefer the use of custom-built
apps that only they have access to, while

177
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:47,399
for others it may be better to use popular
every-day apps like WhatsApp

178
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,470
The activists we talked with did not have
the technology they needed to solve this problem

179
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,139
of no internet access and it was something
that their technology was less easily adapted

180
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,939
to.

181
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:04,579
To ensure the availability of communications
most participants turned to SMS and telephone

182
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,981
calls, being careful to obfuscate what they
were saying or who they were talking to. Those

183
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:13,910
who had internet at home used it to talk to
those outside Sudan, and to pass messages

184
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,160
and news to and from their community. Activists
also used paper pamphlets and graffiti to

185
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,129
get out the word about the time and date of
protests.

186
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,820
We find that It’s difficult to generalize
design recommendations like: mesh networking

187
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,200
in mainstream apps, alternative authentication
methods, data sanitization or deletion on

188
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,060
trigger, as they may be in tension with the
needs and recommendations for other user groups.

189
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,189
However, we recommend that researchers and
technology designers studying user practices

190
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:50,998
ask questions about the geopolitical context
like: the right to privacy, the power held

191
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,810
by authorities, the government control over
the telecommunications infrastructure but

192
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,069
also whether the country has any history of
internet censorship and blackouts and how

193
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:05,009
international politics and sanctions influence
technology access in that country

194
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,060
In addition, we also think it’s important
to ask questions about the characteristics

195
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,779
of the users: things like baseline digital
literacy, knowledge sharing and trust within

196
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:19,649
the community and what is the common security
knowledge disseminated among these communities

197
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:20,199
Thank you
