hello i'm freddie bar smith a phd

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,400
student at the university of oxford

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,240
i'm here to present the paper titled

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
survivalism systematic analysis of

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,480
windows malware living off the land

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,160
this research was a collaboration with

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,599
researchers from cisco telus

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,520
what is a living off the land binary

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,960
there have been various definitions of

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
living off the land in the literature

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
in this paper we define a living of the

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
land binary as any binary with a

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
recognized legitimate use

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
that is leveraged during an attack to

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
directly perform malicious action

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
or to assist indirectly in a sequence of

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,680
actions

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
that have a final malicious outcome

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,440
these are binaries that are typically

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,559
considered benign

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,360
being repurposed for malicious activity

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,760
for example common windows utilities

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,239
such as net or regedit typically used to

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,520
administer hosts

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,600
can instead be used to modify firewalls

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,440
or internal configurations

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,160
to further an attack scripting utilities

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,320
such as the mshta program

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,239
can even be used to execute attack and

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,680
controlled scripts

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
within an apparently benign context

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
the malicious use of these binaries has

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
been reported anecdotally and appears to

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
be growing

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
as such we sought to conduct thorough

36
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
study of this phenomena

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
there is no systematic study in the

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
academic literature of this phenomenon

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
yet

40
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
one of the most skilled apt groups

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
turler is shown here

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,040
we found that by analyzing the samples

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,200
of one of the earlier malware campaigns

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
there was only one living off the land

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,560
technique used in the kill chain

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
that being run dll-32

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
for the latter campaign the 2018

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,320
mosquito campaign

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
we found a high number of different

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
living off the land techniques being

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
used by the same group

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,159
this shows the adoption of living off

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
the land techniques principally because

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,119
of their evasive

55
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,159
capabilities different apt malware

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
campaigns

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
we deployed payloads using this malware

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
against 10 different antiviruses

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
taken from a list of the most popular

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,840
antivirus software

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
our first experiment here highlights

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
where malware authors use these

63
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,840
techniques

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
they are capable of evading all of the

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,880
top

66
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
antivirus software these tests showed

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
that low bin usage indeed has an impact

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,000
on the av

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
industry and this problem shouldn't be

70
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
overlooked

71
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
we repeated our tests on windows 10

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
machines nine months after our initial

73
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
evasion testing

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
this allowed us to see whether antivirus

75
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,680
firms had managed to patch their

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
heuristic detection algorithms

77
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
it's worth noting that while several

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
antivirus products appear to have

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,160
patched their algorithms

80
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
if we kept the same parameters but

81
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
switched the payloads in all but seven

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
cases we were still

83
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,959
able to evade the antivirus detection

84
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
algorithms this highlights the

85
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
seriousness of the problem

86
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
the living off the land techniques can

87
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
appear so close to legitimate behavior

88
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
they are hard to detect even when known

89
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,079
about

90
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
in performing this research we

91
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
tried to answer five distinct research

92
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
questions

93
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
we first sought to understand what

94
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,480
benefit the use of living off the land

95
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
binaries would provide

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
to prompt their increased use our first

97
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
research question was can living off the

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
land techniques be used to evade

99
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
commercial antivirus

100
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
this would subsequently motivate our

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
later work

102
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
there are plenty of blog posts where

103
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
malware researchers report families

104
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,760
using living off the land techniques in

105
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,239
different ways for this reason

106
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
our second question sought to understand

107
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
how prevalent these techniques are in

108
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
malware data sets

109
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
our second research question but not

110
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
only this

111
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
living off the land techniques can be

112
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
used to carry out a myriad of different

113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
malicious actions

114
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
what purposes do malware binaries use

115
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,640
living off the land binaries for

116
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
our third research question and how does

117
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,440
this usage vary across malware families

118
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
our fourth research question finally is

119
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
binary is a dual use

120
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
our final research question asked what

121
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,319
the overlap was between legitimate and

122
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,480
malicious

123
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
usage of them and whether there were

124
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
notable differences

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
that might be a useful basic

126
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,840
for heuristic detection

127
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
in performing our analysis there were a

128
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,480
number of different

129
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
commodity malware campaigns that make

130
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
use of living off the land techniques

131
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
we used a large number of

132
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,880
data sets in order to increase the

133
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,160
reliability

134
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
of our results and ensure that they were

135
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,199
also varied

136
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
we also take special steps in order to

137
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
make sure our data sets are reliable

138
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
by removing erroneous data we made use

139
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
of various well-known commodity malware

140
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
data sets such as ember

141
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,040
ember benign virus share vx underground

142
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
georgia tech and male share we also had

143
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,199
some private data sets that we used and

144
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,479
created ourselves

145
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
one was the apt data set when we

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,120
collected 16 000 apt samples from

147
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
automated processing of threat

148
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
intelligence reports

149
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
this allowed us to zero in on apt

150
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
campaigns which were of special interest

151
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,479
another was a data set where we had

152
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
written yara rules and used live hunt to

153
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
get a list of samples

154
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
that we discovered to be using living

155
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,039
off the land techniques as they were

156
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,720
uploaded to the platform

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
these rules assist with detection

158
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
vt balanced is the data set that we

159
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
collected of various malware samples

160
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,000
this is representative of various

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
malware families

162
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,240
there are a number of different

163
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
characteristics that we use to augment

164
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
the data contained by these malware

165
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
hashes

166
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,479
this data is added for the purpose of

167
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
making analysis more effective

168
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
first scene is used for determining the

169
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
first time a virus sample being seen

170
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,680
av class family is the family to which

171
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
malware sample belongs

172
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,199
this is the state of the art in malware

173
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
research from a paper in 2017.

174

behavioral reports list processes and

175
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
shell commands executed by a given

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
malware sample

177
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,759
there are a few different execution

178
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,080
purposes that can be identified from our

179
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,759
data and the behavioral reports for each

180
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,560
sample

181
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
we used iterative classification in

182
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,840
order to do this

183
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
some examples here show our technique

184
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,800
identification method

185
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
we can identify execution by several

186
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,280
means

187
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
we identify proxied execution as an

188
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
execution purpose

189
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,440
through examples such as

190
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,520
nshda.exe with

191
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,919
hta as a parameter we'll run dll32 with

192
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
a dll parameter

193
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,360
we can identify persistence wherein

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
malware tries to surreptitiously remain

195
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
on a system such as that conducted by

196
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,160
sc.xe

197
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,520
bitsadmin.xe skittus.xe or x.xy

198
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
delayed execution is another use case

199
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,880
such as that

200
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,120
used by grey energy through ping.xi

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
there is firewall modification such as

202
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,599
that used by

203
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,479
netsh.exe with the firewall parameter

204
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,199
there's registry modification wherein

205
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,039
the add and delete parameters are used

206
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
with reg.xy

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
further example is permissions

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,240
modification when

209
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,360
calculus.exe is used with an absolute

210
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
file parameter

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
file opening is another execution

212
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
purpose that is identified

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,319
there is reconnaissance wherein a

214
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,800
malware sample is trying to reconnoiter

215
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
the local environment using commands

216
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,319
such as net dot xe

217
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
and ipconfig.xt finally tasks can be

218
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,680
stopped using commands such as

219
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
taskkill.exe

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
with the parameter of a program

221
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
here we show you the average prevalence

222
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
across data sets for living off the land

223
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,080
techniques

224
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
we initially found that a benign data

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,919
set contained a far lower percentage of

226
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,800
samples

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,479
using living off the land techniques at

228
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,080
2.5 percent

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,680
this gives scope heuristic detection

230
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
the apt data set contains just over 25

231
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
percent of samples

232
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,160
using living off the land techniques

233
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,360
meaning that these are advanced

234
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
techniques used most of all by skilled

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
threat actors

236
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
there are differences in execution

237
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
purposes shown between

238
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
different data sets here the most common

239
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,319
eventual purpose of execution being

240
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,599
reconnaissance

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,319
task stopping or proxied execution we

242
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,560
can see that the distribution of

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
execution

244
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,759
per says is different across data sets

245
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,360
particularly interesting is the apt

246
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
malware data set wherein the main two

247
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,639
use cases

248
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
are proxied execution and delayed

249
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
execution such as that

250
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
conducted via ping dot exit

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
the figure in the center shows there is

252
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,599
differing prevalence of

253
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,640
binaries within different data sets this

254
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,200
is to say

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
the distribution of the most common

256
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
living off the land binaries differs

257
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,839
between data sets

258
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
the shaded boxes are the most common

259
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
binaries used in each dataset which we

260
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
can see varies

261
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
our fourth research question is which

262
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
malware families and types use living

263
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
off the land binaries most prolifically

264
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,680
and how does their usage differ so this

265
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
data on families which we got using the

266
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
state of the art tool av class

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,640
classified samples into families we can

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
see that only a small number of families

269
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
have a high percentage of their samples

270
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
using these techniques

271
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
conversely a large number of families

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
that have a small percentage of their

273
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
samples using these techniques

274
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
one thing we also encountered was the

275
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,720
use of living off the land techniques by

276
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
apt malware

277
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
as we saw a few slides ago living off

278
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
the land usage was over twice as common

279
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
in apt data sets as it was in commodity

280
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
malware

281
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
so we can see here some notable apt

282
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
malware campaigns use living off the

283
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,200
land techniques

284
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
in a very large percentage of their

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
samples there are also a lot of

286
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
combinations of different binaries

287
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
within the data set

288
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
and those apt groups that use living off

289
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,959
the land binaries use them across

290
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
multiple campaigns

291
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
for the ember and ember benign data sets

292
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
we compared we found that they were

293
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,040
interesting results

294
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
across these execution purpose

295
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
categories there are some noticeable

296
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
differences between samples

297
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,079
for instance proxied execution was far

298
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
more common in the benign dataset than

299
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,519
it was in the malicious one

300
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,279
similarly with task stopping and file

301
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
opening this can have implications for

302
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,640
detection

303
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
but certain act such as registry

304
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
modification shown to be more common in

305
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
malicious data sets than they are in

306
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,959
benign ones

307
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,880
the takeaways of our research is that we

308
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,160
discovered there was an overall

309
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,320
prevalence of 9.6

310
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
living off the land techniques averaged

311
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
across all commodity malware data sets

312
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
compared to the far higher

313
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,320
prevalence in apt malware data sets

314
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,880
26.26 percent we also discovered that

315
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,600
there's a large

316
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,519
variability across different families of

317
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,720
malware

318
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
there is also a high forced positive

319
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,079
risk when detecting use of these

320
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,800
binaries

321
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,079
as we show you by comparison of

322
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,480
malicious and benign biasing ember

323
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,040
and ember benign dataset

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,680
and our evasion experiments different

325
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,480
services

326
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
give the capability to develop detection

327
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
algorithms such as some of those we

328
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,360
assisted with

329
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,519
by a responsible disclosure to antivirus

330
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,320
firms especially kaspersky and sophos

331
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,399
there are also mitigations such as the

332
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,360
removal

333
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,600
of malware that used anti-vm techniques

334
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
from our data sets

335
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,279
by identifying crashed and blank reports

336
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,200
which sandbox states that would give

337
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
erroneous results we adhered to the

338
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,360
three critical assessment criteria in

339
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
rosso's

340
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
2012 paper prudent practices for malware

341
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
experiments

342
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
that is correctness transparency and

343
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,959
realism as far as was possible in our

344
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,680
paper

345
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
of course as this is the first work in

346
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,519
this domain

347
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,079
there's a lot of future work still to do

348
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,680
one area is the deployment of these

349
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,839
techniques by human operators

350
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,680
human operators are very common in

351
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
ransomware and other malware groups

352
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
and often use living off the land

353
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
techniques in their post exploitation

354
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,760
activity

355
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
in many cases these are open source or

356
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
off-the-shelf hacking tools

357
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,680
another is the use of linux living off

358
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
the lan techniques linux living of the

359
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,680
land techniques are known as gtfo bins

360
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
to match the colloquial name of lower

361
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
benz for windows systems

362
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
there is also development of detection

363
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,200
algorithms there's another avenue of

364
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,839
research

365
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,519
particularly for edr systems

366
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,800
and in developing these detection

367
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
algorithms

368
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,399
the most positive rates and patterns we

369
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,279
discovered

370
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,720
can potentially be useful there

371
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
so in conclusion this is the first paper

372
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,040
looking at this new

373
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,279
trend of living off the land techniques

374
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
we tested the vulnerability of antivirus

375
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,839
to evasion by these techniques

376
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,200
no av copes well with these

377
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
we also performed a large scale

378
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,839
assessment of the prevalence of these

379
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,480
techniques

380
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
in commodity and apt malware datasets

381
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,399
thank you for listening to our

382
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
presentation

383
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
please let me know if you do have any

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
questions in the preceding q a

385
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,839
many thanks
