00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
hello everyone i'm eaton

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,399
from indiana university bloomington this

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,759
is the john work with

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
institute of information engineering

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
chinese academy of sciences

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,639
today i'm glad to share with you guys

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,839
our new work

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,080
we provide you a new technique to

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,039
automatically

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,000
discover the network vulnerabilities

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,720
just by

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,320
analyzing documentation

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,119
first let's look at center network with

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,279
new technologies and virgin iv

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,520
generation the general network has

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
profoundly changed our life

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,320
especially the 4g with a higher rate

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,360
faster speed

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,920
and greater capability allowed us to

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
connect our work and daily life

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,960
to just one small mobile that really

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440
broadcast the intelligent life

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,920
the central network plays a pivotal role

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
in the current world

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
so naturally their security and privacy

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
become critically important and i expect

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
it to be there any scrutinized

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
but unfortunately actually

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
today the central network are much less

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
protective and thought

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
it often involves the rest security and

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,760
privacy risks

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,159
and most vulnerabilities are discovered

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,240
by our whole community analysis

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
of course recently there are some

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
systematic solutions

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
they utilize the traditional software

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,400
vulnerability discovery methodologies

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
such as fuzzing and more checking into

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,159
the cellular network

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,320
but they still cause a lot of manual

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
effort infesting

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,799
previous work manually identify the

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
security properties

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,840
and use them to guide the mutation of

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
the inject messages

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
this requires a human to have an

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
in-depth understanding about the network

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,960
design

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,200
the model checking previous research

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
even rely more manufactured

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
people need to build the model manually

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,759
and further give the security properties

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,040
manually too so considering current

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,079
situation

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,880
we want to explore a both systematic and

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,840
automatic way

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,759
that can discover the general network

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,639
vulnerability

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
looking to this general network

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
development ecosystem

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,000
we found a specific phenomenon the

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
central network

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
connects all over the world it is a

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
super complex system

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
including many different kind of devices

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
such as mobile

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,160
lt device space station car network and

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
so on

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
so natural there are many device

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,640
manufacturers from all over the world

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,959
so in order to achieve the central

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,760
network

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
all the manufacturers must follow the

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
same specification

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
which is provided by 3gpp an

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
organization uniting telecommunications

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,160
standard

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
development organizations across the

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
world and providing

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
and maintaining central technic

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,000
communication technology specifications

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,159
because of the complexity of the senior

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,040
network

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,760
now street pp has more than 3000

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
specifications for it

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
we randomly checked several of them all

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,640
of them

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
are pretty long including hundreds even

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,360
thousands pages we believe that such

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
huge specifications must include some

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,959
clues

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
that can guide us analyzing network

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,080
security

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
so in our research we made the first

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
step to consider one situation

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,599
when a specification describes a

98
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,120
sensitive operation

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
such as transmitting a private

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
information or releasing a connection

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
because of the huge number and

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
complexity of the specification

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
we're curious about whether the

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
manufacturer developers could

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,599
implement it correctly and securely

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
if not there may be a risk in necessary

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
network

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
in our research we focus on the nas

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,879
protocol

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,040
generally we could simplify as the

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
neural network architecture

112
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,439
as a slide shows when the mobile also

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:05,840
called

114
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
ue user equipment want to

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
get a service from the core network it

116
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
will connect to a base station and

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,879
the base station connects to a core

118
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,720
network the nes

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
protocol is a layer between the uae and

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
the mme

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
which is the surveillance network the

122
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
nes

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,040
provides several procedures for mobility

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
and security control when the ue using a

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
network

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
for example in order to manage ue's

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,639
mobility

128
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
there's a touch procedure it is used to

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,919
build a connection to a network from the

130
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,720
ui

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,360
and is a detached procedure that is used

132
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
to release the connection

133
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
and when the ue is in the idle state and

134
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
the mmb has information to center it

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,520
the s provides a paging procedure for

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
security control

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,919
the unless also provides several

138
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,600
procedures for example the

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
identification procedure

140
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
that is used for the mme to request a

141
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,280
uee's identity

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
considering our previously imagined

143
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,240
situation we defined a sentence related

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
to a sensitive operation in the is

145
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
specification

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
if the network receives a detached

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
request message

148
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
before the ongoing identification

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
procedure has been completed

150
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,440
the network shows a water identification

151
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,240
procedure

152
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,759
and shall progress the detached

153
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
procedure here

154
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,759
to avoid identification procedure could

155
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,639
be considered

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
as a risk operation so we won't know

157
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
when the victimizer and the

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,600
network is performing an identification

159
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,479
procedure

160
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,440
during this period if the network

161
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
receiver did have to request a message

162
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
from the malicious ue

163
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,720
who spoke the victim uus we're curious

164
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,440
about

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,680
whether the mme will successfully

166
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,520
remember to authenticate some

167
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,800
malicious ue or just follow the short

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,039
description to perform the risk

169
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,000
population

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
to abort the identification procedure

171
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,880
with the victim building

172
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
so carrying that starts with testing of

173
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,000
4g

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
simulation environment because

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,039
considering the ethics we cannot perform

176
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,840
experiment

177
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,479
in commercial network so we're testing a

178
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,520
simulator

179
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
but in our testing environment with the

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
president fund

181
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,000
that mme not only opportunity

182
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
identification procedure

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
but for the release of connection with

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,639
the victim ue

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,440
the victim ue finally got a dos attack

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,639
so from this observation in the is

187
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
we have a new idea to find central

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
networks

189
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,840
vulnerability systematically and

190
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,199
automatically our high-level idea

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
is first to detect an indicator from a

192
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
documentation

193
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,479
the hazard indicator which describes a

194
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
risk corporation

195
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,199
and then we use it to guide the test

196
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,560
case generation

197
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
based on indicators information we

198
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,599
decide

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
what attack messages should be sent at

200
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
what target state

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,039
finally we execute a test case in our

202
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,319
test environment

203
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
and identify the poc so next

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
i will introduce the key techniques

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,639
industry states

206
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,400
first the hazard indicator detection as

207
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,639
an example shows the hazard indicator

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,880
is a short description documentary

209
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
operation which we consider to be risky

210
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,400
so it also describes the

211
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,520
condition to trick the operation so to

212
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,319
find such

213
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,800
indicator our approach is designed to

214
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
search all the conditional sentence that

215
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
implies a risk corporation in the whole

216
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
specification

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
the conditional sentence is easy to

218
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
identify just by the keywords such as if

219
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,360
when

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
and extra so the challenge here comes to

221
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,960
how to decide whether the consequential

222
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840
sentence

223
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
implies a risk operation in our work we

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
leverage

225
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
an nlp technique called textual

226
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,879
entailment

227
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
it can decide whether a hypothesis

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
entails a premise systematically

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
here for the example in the slide

230
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
through the test

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
entailment we can detect the

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
consequential sentence underlined in the

233
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,639
red

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,840
implies the risk operation of our

235
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,120
procedure notably the textual

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,919
entitlement

237
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
is a model that can understand semantics

238
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,200
so no matter the sentences in text

239
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,799
changes such as change into

240
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,919
a procedure shall be aborted or the

241
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,719
sentence uses anonymity such as using

242
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,958
a terminated procedure the test

243
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,240
transmitter model

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
always works so given the risk operation

245
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
on both procedure

246
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
we don't need to find its variations and

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,760
we can

248
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
easily identify those sentences in

249
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,040
primary risk operation

250
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
while using the nlp technique test

251
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
current element

252
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,279
of course we believe that except for the

253
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
risk population body procedure

254
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,959
there are other risk operations

255
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,399
specification we

256
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,360
also need to extract him here our idea

257
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,959
is based on observation

258
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,640
that the risk operation will always

259
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
appear together in that documentation

260
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
so we use correlation analysis

261
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,360
point wise mutation prevention a

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,080
standard approach in

263
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,600
computational linguistics to identify

264
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,160
them

265
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
from the seed abort procedure our

266
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
approach extended

267
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,880
several new risk corporation description

268
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
such as release resource deactivate

269
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,560
context

270
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
and progress procedure here the progress

271
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
procedure is interesting

272
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,360
because it is opposite to abort

273
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
procedures menus

274
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,839
but it does implicitly

275
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
imply them when someone progress the new

276
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,760
procedure

277
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
he may stop and hold procedure

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
next let's move to the second step for a

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,279
given general threat module like here

280
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,399
ue issue centered attack message to mme

281
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
to interrupt the communication between

282
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
the enemy and the victim ue

283
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,959
we could have a test case templating

284
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,079
advance

285
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,279
in our work to generate a test case our

286
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,839
approach

287
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,880
is to automatically extract a targeted

288
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,440
state

289
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
and a text message from the hazard

290
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,440
indicator

291
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
to the other template here we authorize

292
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:28,880
an

293
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
lp technique called the dependence

294
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,279
passing to analyze the syntactic

295
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
structure of the sentence

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
as shown in the slides in the dependency

297
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
passing the verb

298
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,640
takes the central control in the clause

299
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
or otherwise

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
either directly or indirectly modifies

301
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
the verb

302
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
for example the word network is a verbs

303
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
a received subject

304
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
the word message colored in res a

305
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
accounting green is an object of the

306
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,399
verb

307
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
received and the word detach

308
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
request paladin blue has a compound

309
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
relation to a word message

310
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,959
so from these relationships we can

311
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,079
identify

312
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,279
that the detached request message is a

313
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
text message issued by the malicious

314
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
theory

315
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
by the same way we can decide the enemy

316
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,959
exact attack listed after he sends out

317
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,760
an identity

318
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,480
by request message before he receives

319
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
the identified response

320
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
finally we execute the test case in our

321
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,600
test environment with three

322
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,640
popular 4g simulators automatically in

323
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
order to attribute

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
we modify the open source simulator to

325
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
set hooks and around the listener each

326
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,440
of them

327
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,839
um we activate the host dynamically

328
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
according to a test case

329
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
so in the test screen when the mme

330
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
enters the target state

331
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
the hook will notify the munitions ue to

332
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
issue the attack message

333
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,120
one challenge here is how to get enemy

334
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
to attack the state

335
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
after analyzing wave funded most

336
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,399
procedural states can be

337
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
entered naturally after just

338
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,760
rebooting the phone and for the others

339
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
although they usually happen

340
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,000
undetermined but they are always been

341
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,959
after the

342
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,279
attached procedure finishes such as a

343
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
paging procedure tracking error

344
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
procedure so

345
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
we leverage your hooks again when the

346
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
enemy finishes the attach procedure

347
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,399
we use a hook to notify the enemy or the

348
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
victim ue to start the

349
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,959
related procedure immediately to enter

350
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,399
the target stage

351
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,760
and finally we check the traffic lock

352
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
to monitor whether the victim ui has

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
been disrupted

354
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,639
if yes we output a test case that then

355
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,680
identify

356
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,279
identified posing

357
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
now let's look at our whole approach

358
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
in one word we identify the indicator

359
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
from a specification

360
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
and then use it to guide the test case

361
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
generation and

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,959
execute the test case to identify plc

363
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,839
our system is

364
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,040
input at a similar network documentation

365
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
and a threat model specifically a risk

366
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,880
corporation description

367
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
and receipt now used to extend the other

368
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,680
risk corporation descriptions

369
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,399
and a test case template that is used to

370
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,839
generate test case

371
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
and output is unidentified posing the

372
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,880
whole workflow is automatically

373
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
running our system as protocol which

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
includes more than

375
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
500 pages and 200 and thousands words

376
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
we found the stem vulnerabilities in

377
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
open 5g

378
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,839
simulator and 10 vulnerabilities in

379
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,560
sslt and open air interface respectively

380
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,479
all of them are new vulnerabilities

381
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,320
one may ask whether these

382
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
vulnerabilities can be exploited

383
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
in the real world since generally in

384
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
central network it is hard to monitor

385
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
the aiming state

386
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,160
here our answer is yes we figure out a

387
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,279
practical attack

388
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,240
exporting these vulnerabilities we don't

389
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,720
monitor the enemy's precise state

390
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
we estimate attack window that eminent

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,560
state may enter into

392
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
in central network the page message is a

393
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
broadcast message that every mobile can

394
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
receive covered by a space station

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,839
receiving a page message with different

396
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,440
parameters you

397
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
will start a different procedure

398
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,959
immediately so

399
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,760
leveraging it using the downlinks

400
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
messages paper

401
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,000
attacker can identify the victim

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,639
you use target procedure from the page

403
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,800
message and its parameters

404
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
once the attacker snips the pages it can

405
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
send a text message according to a

406
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
patient's parameter immediately to

407
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
perform a dos attack

408
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
because we cannot perform attacks on the

409
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,240
commercial network due to

410
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,760
ethics we reported them to a same median

411
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
and they did to chinese national

412
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
vulnerability databases

413
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
both of them have confirmed that the

414
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
vulnerabilities indeed exist

415
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
in major commercial careers by the way

416
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,079
we record

417
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,360
our tech demo and put him in in our

418
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,079
website

419
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,000
it's very interesting you could watch it

420
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
for listening

421
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
under our workflow were also tested in

422
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,880
another class

423
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,680
thread model and now when the victoria

424
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,800
connects the fake

425
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
network in this given thread model we

426
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,440
also find many vulnerabilities and

427
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
receive the confirmation from the mobile

428
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,880
manufacturers

429
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,519
finally let's summarize our contribution

430
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,240
first

431
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,279
we provide a new technique to discover

432
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,440
senior network vulnerabilities we're

433
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,199
extracting the indicators from the

434
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,240
documentation

435
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
and use them to guide your vulnerability

436
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,279
discovery

437
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
second we implement our approach and

438
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,920
fund 42 vulnerabilities in the real

439
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,320
world

440
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
including 10 new ones in our research we

441
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,519
proposed a new direction

442
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,279
to discover the neural network

443
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,959
vulnerability from

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,440
analytics documentation but it is

445
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,560
relatively preliminary

446
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
just scratching surveys the huge

447
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
specification

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
contains a lot of other clues about the

449
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,079
security risks

450
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,040
automatic discover of this monorail this

451
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,399
security weakness

452
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,560
will contribute to the great evaluation

453
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
of the sailor security

454
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,360
we will study them in our future work

455
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,000
and we

456
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,320
also hope more researchers come to study

457
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
this era together

458
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
that's our report thanks for your

459
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,240
listening
