1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,600
hi everyone and thank you for joining my

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,480
talk

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,279
i'm pardes emma minaini a postdoctoral

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
scholar at university of washington

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,080
today

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,400
i'm going to talk about our project to

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,440
identify

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,400
how privacy and security factors impact

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,880
iut

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
consumers risk perception and

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
willingness to purchase

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
this work has been conducted by lovers

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
during my phd at carnegie mellon

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
university and it's a joint work with my

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,359
colleagues

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
jannar newford and laurie at cmu

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
many of us have the experience of

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
purchasing a smart device for ourselves

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,600
or others

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
now i want you to remember the time when

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
you were in the physical store

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,280
or search online for the smart device to

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,320
buy

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
you probably saw the information on the

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
price of the device or its technical

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,960
specification

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
for example its size or internet

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,559
connectivity

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
but do you remember seeing any

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,320
information

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
about the privacy or security practices

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560
of the device at the time of purchase

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,520
the answer is probably no because

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,240
usually

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,240
that information is nowhere to be found

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,200
when purchasing a smart device online or

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
in the store

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
consumers are not able to make an

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
informed purchase decision

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,119
as the information on the security and

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,159
privacy behavior of the smart devices

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
is not readily available to them

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,759
to help inform consumers purchase

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
decision making process

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
we designed an iot privacy and security

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,799
label

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
somewhat similar to nutrition labels for

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,479
food items

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,720
we talked about the details of this

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
label in our paper at oakland 2012

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
our label has two layers a primary layer

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
and a second

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
layer that can be accessed through the

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
primary layer by either scanning the qr

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,000
code

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,439
or typing in the url we designed this

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,159
label

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,880
mainly based on inputs from a diverse

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
sample of privacy and security experts

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
from academia

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
industry government and ngos

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,800
from the literature however we know that

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
experts understanding

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,599
could be different from consumers it is

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
important that the label

66
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,920
conveys risk to consumers accurately and

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,879
potentially

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
impacts their willingness to purchase

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
the smart device

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
to assess this we conducted a large

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,640
scale online study

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
which i will focus on for the rest of

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
this talk

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,680
past research has shown that the

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
perceived risk and willingness to

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,800
purchase

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
are comparable to the actual risk and

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,840
actual purchase behavior

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,920
some of the factors that have been

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
identified to impact the risk perception

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
are the target of the risk

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
level of familiarity with the technology

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
and attitudes and concerns

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
and some of the factors that could

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
potentially influence purchase behavior

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,239
are price brand usability word of mouth

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,080
and privacy among other factors

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
we explored how the content of our

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,200
design

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
label conveys risk to consumers and

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
influences their willingness to purchase

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
the smart device

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,440
in our survey we asked participants to

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
imagine purchasing a smart device with a

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
privacy and security label

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,120
the label talked about only one privacy

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
or security attribute value

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,680
each participant was assigned to answer

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
questions

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,760
related to three purchase scenarios

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
just an example of a scenario that we

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,239
presented to participants

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,480
the words inside the brackets are the

104
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920
factors that divert in the scenarios

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
imagine you are making a decision to

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,239
purchase a smart speaker with voice

107
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,319
assistant for yourself

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,799
this device has a microphone that will

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
listen and respond to your voice

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,599
commands

111
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,599
the price of the device is within your

112
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
budget and the features are all

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
what you would expect from a smart

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
speaker with voice assistant

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,239
on the package of the device there is a

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,439
label that

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
indicates the following privacy and

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,279
security practice

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
purpose of data collection tailored

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,560
advertising

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,320
and monetization at the end of each

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
scenario

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
we asked participants to specify on a

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
lucky scale

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
how each attribute value per would

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
change their risk perception and

127
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,919
willingness to purchase

128
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,560
and why

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,840
at the beginning of my talk i showed you

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,639
the label

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,120
that we previously designed based on

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,840
inputs from

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,759
experts our design label has 47

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
pieces of information which is clearly

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
too many

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
to include in this study therefore

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,880
we selected a subset of these factors to

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,919
assess

139
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,720
specifically we consider the privacy or

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
security attributes which did not have a

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,919
hyperlink

142
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
on the label and what do i mean by that

143
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,919
for example in the security mechanism

144
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,960
section

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
there were some attributes that had url

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,639
as their value for example hardware

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,000
safety

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
as these attributes did not have

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
concrete values

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,039
we did not include them in our study but

151
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
there were some other attributes which

152
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,400
could take specific values for example

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
security updates which could have values

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
such as automatic

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
manual or consent based in this study

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
we quantified the impact of these type

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
of attributes on risk perception and

158
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
willingness to purchase

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
for each attribute we selected two

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
values which we hypothesized to be the

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,520
most protected and the least protective

162
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,680
for example for the purpose of data

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
collection we use providing main device

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,520
functions

165
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,000
as the most protective value and

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,039
monetization as a least protective value

167
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
be hypothesized that the most protective

168
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,639
values of

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,000
attributes should significantly decrease

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,479
the perceived risk and increase the

171
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
willingness of purchase

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
we expected the opposite for the least

173
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
protective values

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
we designed a mix between subjects and

175
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,160
fitting subject survey

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,520
and amazon mechanical turk we had six

177
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,160
experimental conditions based on two

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
between subject factor of device type

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
a recipient of the device it has the two

180
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
types of devices

181
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,039
smart speaker and smart light bulb

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
we also consider three levels for the

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,319
recipient of the device

184
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
purchasing the device for yourself

185
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
gifting to a family member or gifting to

186
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
a friend

187
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
the video subject factor was the privacy

188
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,280
and security information

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
we randomly assigned each participant to

190
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
answer questions

191
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,599
about 3 out of 33 privacy and security

192
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
attribute value first

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,080
a regression analysis showed that

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,199
participants

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
perceived a significantly higher risk

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
for the smart speaker

197
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
compared to the smart light bulb

198
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
and they were significantly less willing

199
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
to purchase a smart speaker compared to

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,759
the smart light bulb

201
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,840
as i previously mentioned we considered

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
three levels for the recipient of the

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,039
device

204
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,039
and our analysis showed that the device

205
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,240
recipient was not a significant factor

206
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,120
to describe the risk perception however

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
participants were significantly less

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,240
inclined

209
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,479
to purchase the smart device for their

210
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
friends compared to buying a device for

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
themselves

212
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,479
we qualitatively coded the open-ended

213
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,680
responses

214
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
to explain this behavior we found that

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
participants frequently mentioned

216
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
that friends should decide for

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
themselves if they want to have a device

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,759
with

219
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,879
specific privacy and security behaviors

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
the statistical models indicated that

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
the impact of

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,280
almost all tested privacy and security

223
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,639
attribute values

224
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,560
on risk perception and willingness to

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,840
purchase were as the hypothesis meaning

226
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,039
our hypothesized most protected values

227
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,680
significantly decrease the perceived

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,479
risk

229
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,799
and increase the willingness to purchase

230
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,799
and the least protective values

231
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,719
significantly increase the risk

232
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,399
perception and decrease

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,279
participants desire to purchase a smart

234
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
device

235
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
there were a few exceptions though the

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,440
open-ended explanations

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
helped us identify several reasons as to

238
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
why some participants

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
additives to our risk perception and

240
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
willingness to purchase

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
were different from what they

242
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
hypothesized

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,800
starting with the average time to patch

244
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,200
based on the ul guidelines in our study

245
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,680
we selected the most protected value for

246
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
this attribute

247
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
to be one month and the least protective

248
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
value to be six months

249
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,800
in our models both values significantly

250
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
increase the perceived risk and decrease

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,160
the willingness to purchase

252
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
this is the jitter plot for the average

253
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
time to patch

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
the x-axis indicates the impact of the

255
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
attribute value

256
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,640
and risk perception and the y-axis

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,839
shows their impact on willingness to

258
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,080
purchase

259
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,160
the blue points represent the most

260
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,279
protective value

261
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
in this case one month and the red dots

262
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
represent the least protective value

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,640
which here is six months

264
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,440
and as you can see most of the blue and

265
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
red points are clustered

266
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
in the bottom right showing an increase

267
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,360
in risk perception

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
and decrease in building nasal purges as

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,279
a best practice

270
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
manufacturers should pass their

271
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
vulnerabilities in the shortest time but

272
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
sometimes depending on various factors

273
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
it could take longer to issue a patch

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,160
our findings suggest that the

275
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,079
manufacturers need to provide

276
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,040
consumers with justifications as but it

277
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
takes them a specific amount of time

278
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,600
to pass the vulnerability and why it

279
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
might not be practical to passion

280
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,720
vulnerabilities

281
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
faster purpose of data collection was

282
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
another factor

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that did not change some participants

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
risk perception and willingness to

285
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
purchase

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
as we expected although we hypothesized

287
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,519
that providing data

288
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
for device functionality should decrease

289
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,760
the perceived risk

290
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
that was true for only 12 percent of

291
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,600
participants

292
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
other participants stated that this

293
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
information would not

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,240
impact the risk perception or would even

295
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
increase the risk

296
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
mostly due to their lack of trust in

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
manufacturers

298
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
a participant mentioned the companies

299
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,360
who collect data

300
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
are incredibly untrustworthy they do not

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
have consumer's best interest in mind

302
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,120
when they are utilizing the data they

303
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
collect

304
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,760
we also notice a few privacy and

305
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,279
security misconceptions

306
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
for example some participants thought

307
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,320
that no

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
security updates indicate better

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,920
security

310
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
as the device does not need to be

311
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
updated a participant said

312
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,399
if there are no updates then the system

313
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
must be providing maximum security

314
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,440
already

315
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,480
or if it says that there is no

316
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,040
update that means that it is already

317
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,760
up-to-date

318
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
all non-security issues have been

319
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,399
currently solved

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
another misconception was related to

321
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,160
mentioning the average time to patch

322
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,399
some participants believe that

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,720
even mentioning the abort patch

324
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
indicates that the device is not secure

325
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,600
as it needs to be patched a participle

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
said

327
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
on the label it advertises that patches

328
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,639
are even needed

329
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,560
that is why there is a perception of

330
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
decreased privacy or

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
the fact that there was a security

332
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
vulnerability

333
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
that had to be fixed would cause me to

334
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,399
forego purchasing the device for a

335
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
family member regardless of how recently

336
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,480
the fix was applied

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,240
these themes suggest that being

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
transparent about privacy and security

339
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
practices is not enough

340
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,040
our qualitative responses suggest that

341
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
specific pieces of information

342
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
consumers would like to see to make more

343
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,279
informed decisions

344
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
based on these findings manufacturers

345
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
should provide consumers

346
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
with the justification as to why they

347
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,600
implemented specific

348
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
privacy and security practices in what

349
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,120
base

350
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
a specific practice could protect or

351
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
harm the consumers

352
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
what controls consumers have related to

353
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
each privacy and security practice

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
and if an option is being offered to

355
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,800
control a specific practice what steps

356
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,160
users need to take

357
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,680
to enable that option

358
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
it is important to mention that while

359
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,600
this additional information

360
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,839
could potentially mitigate consumers

361
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,200
uncertainty

362
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
too much information could overwhelm the

363
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,720
consumers

364
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,040
to prevent this we propose adding this

365
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
additional information

366
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,959
in the expanded view of the label which

367
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,959
could be accessed through the second

368
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,600
layer

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
by clicking on the plus sign that is

370
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,360
placed in front of each attribute

371
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
to recap we explored the efficacy

372
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
of our previously designed iot privacy

373
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,240
and security label

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
in conveying grease to consumers and

375
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
influencing their willingness to

376
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,639
purchase

377
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
to do so we assessed the impact of a

378
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
subset of labeled privacy and security

379
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,720
factors

380
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,440
and conducted a large scale online study

381
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
we found that in most cases the label

382
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,560
was effective

383
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,199
to change consumers risk perception and

384
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
inform their willingness to purchase

385
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,440
however

386
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,399
we found a few exceptions by

387
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,320
qualitatively coding the open-ended

388
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,279
responses

389
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,199
we surface participants privacy and

390
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,120
security misconceptions

391
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,199
that impacted the risk perception and

392
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
willingness to purchase

393
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
based on our findings to further inform

394
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,279
consumers we propose adding some

395
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,920
additional information to the label

396
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,320
in this study we look into the impact of

397
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
a subset of labeled privacy and security

398
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,560
factors when being presented as a single

399
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,079
piece of information

400
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
the next step would be to test the

401
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
effectiveness of the complete label

402
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,959
in realistic purchase settings if you

403
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
want to get more information on our

404
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
label project
