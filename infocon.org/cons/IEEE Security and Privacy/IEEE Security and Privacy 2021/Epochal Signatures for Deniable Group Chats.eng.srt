1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,080
hi i'm going to introduce a poker

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
signatures for deniable group chats this

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,879
is joint work with andreas hulsing

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,920
nowadays a lot of communication is moved

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,679
online however some of the properties

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
of offline communication are not

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,680
necessarily preserved that way and one

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,119
of those properties

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,560
is sometimes deniability deniability is

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,359
the notion

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,240
that whatever i say in a communication

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
cannot be later on proven against me

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
that i said it or for that matter

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,159
even that i participated in that

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
communication

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
there is an argument to be had on

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,840
whether this is a desirable property

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,559
however losing this property means that

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,520
the

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
desirable notion of an offline

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,200
communication

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
and an online communication behave in

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,320
the same way

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
no longer applies the reason why this is

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
desirable is that this makes for a

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
very easy to explain security model that

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,199
even lay people can understand

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
now deniability has been around for a

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
while as a notion and for two-party

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,119
chats this is

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,240
mostly a solved problem the core idea

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
there is to

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
use message authentication codes to sign

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,320
messages and then the receiver of a

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
message can

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,479
after verifying that a mac checks out

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,000
concludes that

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
only the supposed sender and i know the

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
key for this and i know i did not create

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
a message therefore it must be from the

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
sender

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,960
this no longer applies for more than two

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,159
parties since then

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
more than one possible sender is left

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
after the check

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
so this becomes a much bigger problem

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,400
for

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
larger groups now something can still be

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
done with pairwise

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
communication there and especially if

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
later on it's verified

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,799
that this communication was the same for

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,600
everyone

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,799
however this does no longer scale

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
very well in that the larger the group

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
the more communication overhead

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
this enforces

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,719
other techniques exist they usually have

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,038
other downsides in other areas

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,560
and we are trying to find something that

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,239
presents a better trait of

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,840
for many many applications now

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
before i continue i should point out

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
that in this work we are only focusing

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
on the technical aspects of deniability

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,520
there are also the social aspects with

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,319
regards to

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
whether this is a desirable notion

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,879
however we leave those to the social

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,239
sciences

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,920
also there are more practical

72
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
considerations that need to be taken

73
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,640
into account

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
such as that if you implement a scheme

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
that's supposed to be deniable

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,599
your distribution should always come

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,959
with a tool that

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
allows the creation of fake transcripts

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
in order to provide

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
actual deniability instead of just the

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
theoretical possibility that a

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
cryptographic protocol

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,879
implies instead of looking into these

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,519
things we

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,720
do however provide a formal security

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
model for offline deniability

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
which to our knowledge in this form is

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
the first we don't claim originality on

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
most of the dimensions of deniability

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,319
but we are not aware of a formal model

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,000
in the stance of a security

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,599
game for these notions secondly we

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
introduced apocalypse signatures which

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,640
are a useful tool

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
with which many non-deniable existing

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
schemes

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
can be turned into deniable schemes

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,879
particularly this applies to many group

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,959
chats

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
now deniability is usually defined by

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
saying there should be a simulator

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,799
that's efficient

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
that can create fake transcripts that

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,400
some judge

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,560
can then not distinguish from real

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
transcripts

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
now the question of course is from where

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,159
should

109
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,560
the exact content of what is going on

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,599
come

111
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
usually we want that this applies for

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
arbitrary interactions and so

113
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
the way this is normally modeled is by

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,799
having the judge

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,640
choose the interaction that she then has

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
to distinguish

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,239
which is how we model this here

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,239
then there's usually a question of

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,680
corruption

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,439
in our case we essentially give all the

121
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
secrets to the judge and say

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
even full corruption of all involved

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
parties should not

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,880
remove deniability here lastly

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,919
there is often a question of adaptive

126
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,960
attacks

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,360
in this work we only focus on offline

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,400
churches that is

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,440
judges that receive transcripts after

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
their completion instead of life

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
online judges who could do

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,880
adaptive attacks are much more difficult

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
beast and their applicability and

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
practice

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
has been questioned before and

136
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
they are very hard to deal with and as

137
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
such we focus on the more established

138
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,360
offline judges here

139
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
to give some intuition for our

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
game the as i said the judge outputs

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
some instructions that should be

142
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
executed and this is done in the form of

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
also called instruction list

144
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
an instruction in an instruction list is

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
essentially something like

146
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
saying at this point alice should send a

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
message through to some

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
chat room bar um and a

149
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
contact and a long list of all these

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
instructions sustain the instruction

151
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
list

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
each instruction is additionally marked

153
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,240
as either exposed

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
challenge hidden or alternate reality

155
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,639
when you give

156
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,840
some intuition despite the scenario and

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880
maybe not being

158
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
that realistic let's look

159
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
at the following example say there is a

160
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,320
police officer who

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
during his office hours participates in

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
a certain chat room

163
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
and creates his transcript of that room

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,440
the judge will later on trust that

165
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,639
transcript as real

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
since the police officer will be

167
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
considered a neutral party in the

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
dispute in question later on

169
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,759
now outside of the police officers

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,600
office hours so when there's no trusted

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
transcript

172
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,120
there are some disputed interactions

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
between parties that become the subject

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
of a legal case

175
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
where the accusing party says this is

176
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
what happened these guys are evil

177
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
and the other parties say this is

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
totally not what happened

179
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,680
these are the challenge actions

180
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
challenge and exposed actions may be

181
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,000
separated by actions for which there is

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,080
no transcript provided to the judge

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
these are the so-called hidden actions

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
they are essentially just no one

185
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,080
trustworthy has a transcript for that

186
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
part

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,280
lastly in case the challenge actions

188
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
are indeed simulated and someone is

189
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
trying to frame other people

190
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,039
there may have been other things that

191
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,000
occurred

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,560
during that time in the real world these

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
are what we call the alternate reality

194
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,120
actions

195
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
and a church will at the end of the day

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,639
have to decide whether the transcript of

197
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,840
the exposed

198
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,599
and the challenge actions is either

199
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,199
completely real

200
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
or whether the transcript of the exposed

201
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,400
action is real

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
the transcript of the challenge actions

203
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
is

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
simulated and the alternate reality

205
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
actions are what actually happened

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,199
now there is one kind of attack that

207
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,880
in many schemes is very hard to prevent

208
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
and that is there might be some state in

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,599
the protocol

210
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
that is preserved among success

211
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
successive actions this might for

212
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
example be some form of an

213
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
ephemeral key used to encrypt some

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
messages

215
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
if this state is preserved between

216
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,160
exposed and challenged actions and is

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
used in such a way such that the judge

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,160
can detect whether these keys match

219
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
or these states match

220
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
then this allows for the trivial attack

221
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
the judge simply checks

222
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
whether the values between the exposed

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,360
and the challenge actions are compatible

224
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
um and while a simulator might be able

225
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,879
to sample

226
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,160
these ephemeral states in a way from the

227
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
same distribution

228
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
resulting in information theoretically

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,680
indistinguishable values

230
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,160
since the judge knows the true value

231
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,720
there is

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
an overwhelming probability that the

233
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,759
judge

234
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
can tell the difference since the values

235
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
will have an overwhelming probability

236
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,399
be equally distributed but different

237
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,799
and in order to prevent this attack uh

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
we will usually have to restrict

239
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
what kind of instruction lists the judge

240
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,480
can output as a challenge

241
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
now the strongest notion in this

242
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,519
framework

243
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
is what we call strong offline

244
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,279
deniability and this is essentially the

245
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,560
notion where they say

246
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,360
there simply must not be any such

247
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,279
preserved state

248
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
and the judge can output whatever

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
consistent set of instruction

250
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
she wants this is an extremely strong

251
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,959
notion

252
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,839
and we conjecture that it is

253
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,160
incompatible

254
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
with um certain other desirable security

255
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
notions like post-compromise secrecy

256
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,680
if an efficient protocol is desired so

257
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
efficient in the sense means

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
a protocol that does not require things

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
like linear length messages in the

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,519
number of group

261
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,800
members now this of course

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,279
rules strong offline deniability out for

263
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,320
many

264
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
chat protocols that consider efficient

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
scaling and these other security

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
properties

267
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,160
and the other extreme that we therefore

268
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
might want to look at is weak offline

269
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
deniability will essentially say

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,959
you simply are not allowed to have weak

271
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
and exposed and challenged actions

272
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
in the same chat room now this is a

273
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
rather weak notion

274
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
since for example it's not allowed for a

275
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
police officer to go into the chat room

276
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
two weeks later

277
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
chat with someone and take a transcript

278
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,240
home from there

279
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
and since this is not possible this

280
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
security notion might often not be

281
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,079
applicable in practical settings

282
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,839
so what we want here is something in

283
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
between these notions that's

284
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
stronger than weak offline deniability

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
but still efficiently achievable

286
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
and this is where we get to hidden full

287
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
interactions

288
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
now an inter a full interaction is

289
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
simply a set of successive actions

290
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
during which every party that is

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
a member of a chat room does something

292
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
usually it will be sending a message it

293
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
might also be joining or leaving

294
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
it might be getting kicked now once

295
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,079
every member of the chatroom has done

296
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,760
something like that we say

297
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
that these actions together form a full

298
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,040
interaction

299
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,959
and a hidden full interaction is still

300
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,600
simply a full interaction that consists

301
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,399
completely

302
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,720
out of hidden actions so the judge does

303
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
not receive any transcript from them

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
and this then induces the security

305
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
notion of hidden full interaction

306
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,360
offline deniability

307
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,839
which is such an intermediate notion as

308
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
i said we wanted

309
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,880
and there the statement is essentially

310
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,600
that

311
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
you can have challenge and exposed

312
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,600
actions in the chat room

313
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
as long as they are always separated by

314
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
such a hidden full interaction

315
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,839
now hidden full interactions are

316
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
actually similar to

317
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
many of the conditions under which

318
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
post-compromised secrecy

319
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
re-establishes secret secrecy after

320
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
a key compromise becomes undone so in

321
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,320
that sense this is also

322
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
a condition that many of you may be

323
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,839
familiar with

324
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,079
and most importantly for our purposes

325
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,079
here hidden full interaction offline

326
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,120
deniability or

327
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
hfi offline deniability is efficiently

328
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,639
achievable

329
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,440
and we will look into why soon before

330
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
that however

331
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,320
let's take another look at the

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
properties that we would like to have

333
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
from group chats first of all there is

334
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
authenticity

335
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
and in most scenarios this simply is not

336
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
a notion that's up for debate

337
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
however if you're willing to sacrifice

338
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,680
this the other two become trivially

339
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,079
achievable

340
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
the second one is efficient scaling so

341
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
having a protocol

342
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
that stays efficient if you have many

343
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,600
many members

344
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
and in a chat room and one

345
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
uh protocol that targets these two

346
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
things is messaging layer security or

347
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,639
mls for short

348
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
that says we want to enable groups with

349
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
thousands of members

350
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
and so we are willing to sacrifice

351
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,120
deniability for this purpose

352
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,920
and this is what mls does and does so

353
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
very well

354
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
on the other hand we also want

355
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,399
deniability

356
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,760
usually at least if you are in the stock

357
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,800
and

358
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
there are some protocols that are

359
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
willing to sacrifice the efficient

360
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
scaling property for this

361
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,480
one example would be signal who has a

362
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,120
linear length message is in the number

363
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
of members of a group

364
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
for a signal many groups are like 10 or

365
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
20 members and there this

366
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
linear length doesn't really hurt since

367
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
the factor is also rather small

368
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
however for something like mls this is

369
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
of course completely unacceptable

370
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,279
now what we are trying to provide is

371
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
something that

372
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
unites all these three properties and in

373
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,480
fact

374
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
if you use mls

375
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,519
together with our apocalypse signatures

376
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
that we'll get to now

377
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
you actually unite all these three

378
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,279
properties

379
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,320
now apocalypse signatures on a very high

380
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,399
level are signatures with an expiration

381
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,199
date

382
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,120
before that date they behave like

383
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
completely regular signatures

384
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,839
and afterwards they are easily forgeable

385
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,800
or simulatable as you say

386
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,079
now this is essentially the opposite

387
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
of forward secure signature the forward

388
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
secure signature

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,360
in case the secret key gets corrupted

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,760
all

391
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
future signatures are insecure because

392
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
everybody who has the secret key can

393
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,959
forge them

394
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,680
but all past signatures remain still

395
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,720
valid since the

396
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,279
secret key does not allow to create

397
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
those past signatures

398
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
what we do for apocalypse signatures is

399
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
pretty much we use this and

400
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,079
turn it around which can be done

401
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,639
efficiently with pebbling schemes

402
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
and in addition to ensure that these now

403
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,519
partial secret keys

404
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,959
are always available when you're

405
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,360
supposed to be we ensure that each

406
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
signature that's created comes with two

407
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
additional pieces of information first

408
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
of all

409
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
it contains the secret key for the least

410
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
recently expired epoch

411
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,160
so that all expired signatures can

412
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
immediately be simulated using that

413
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,680
secret key

414
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
it also contains the secret key of the

415
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
current epoch

416
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,560
and but locked behind the timelock

417
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
puzzle this prevents

418
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,920
the creation of valid forgeries

419
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
since the timer since breaking the

420
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
timelock puzzle is supposed to take

421
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,519
longer than the validity period of the

422
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,040
current secret key

423
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
but afterwards it becomes soon possible

424
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,480
to create

425
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,279
those then expired signatures i should

426
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
mention we think of one epoch has a time

427
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,600
period of like five minutes

428
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
and a small number of epochs is the

429
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,199
validity period of a signature

430
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
and with this we can then go on to um

431
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
replace signatures in many existing

432
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,759
schemes including group

433
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,440
chats and we in our paper we proved that

434
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,120
a large class of

435
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
group chat protocols including mls can

436
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,639
be made

437
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
hfiden offline deniable simply by

438
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
replacing the signatures with apostle

439
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
signatures

440
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
another use that was pointed out to us

441
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
during the review process

442
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
is deniability for day camp signatures

443
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
in the email setting

444
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,959
daycam signatures are another example

445
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,320
for something where

446
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,160
signatures were used to achieve

447
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,079
authenticity

448
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,320
but introduced more properties than just

449
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,920
that authenticity

450
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
including the verifiability by other

451
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,639
parties much later on

452
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,440
that are not the supposed receivers

453
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,399
again this is

454
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
one of those discussions that is social

455
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,600
whether

456
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,320
this is a good thing but it is not what

457
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
was intended

458
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
and by using apocalypse signatures we

459
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
get the properties the dkm signatures

460
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
introduced back down to

461
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
pretty much just the authenticity that

462
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
was desired without introducing this

463
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
independent verifiability later on and

464
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,000
with that

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,920
i thank you for your attention and am

466
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,439
now available for questions
