1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,199
hello everybody this is joint work with

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,319
markle coldways

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,720
myself varun martha karthik nik and

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,400
alessandra schaferu

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,760
and the title of the talk is on the

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,000
anonymity guarantees of anonymous proof

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,879
of state protocols

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,760
or how robin hood will steal your money

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,720
in 2040.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
without further ado we present to you

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
our heroic outlaws

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
robin hood and his closest aide little

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
john as usual they're looking for ways

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
to steal money from the rich

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
to give to the poor let us go listen to

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
what they have to say

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,760
alright john it's been a while how are

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
you i see all these rich people getting

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,399
richer

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,680
and the poor new kids with their

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
startups unable to compete because of

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
their lack of funds

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,840
we need some money to fund these guys

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
let's make a plan to steal some money

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,160
from all these rich people haha yes yes

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
i'm always in for some socially good

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
crime by the way

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
the whole world now works on the

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,159
internet our old ways of just stopping

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,119
someone on the road

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
will not work let's try to find out how

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,920
we can make some more money

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
well with all these issues of global

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
warming and climate change

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,799
i hear everyone is on these proof of

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,720
state blockchains

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
i don't know much about it what can you

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,479
tell me about proof of state little john

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,080
well a proof of state blockchain is one

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,640
in which

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
all parties run a publicly verifiable

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,560
lottery

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
and the winner of this lottery decides

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
the next block on the chin

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
the lottery takes his input the stake of

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
the party and therefore

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,479
higher the stake higher the chances of

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
winning

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
for example here since mr bezos has the

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,960
most take amongst his friends

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,840
he gets to propose more blocks on the

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,759
chin

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
ah then our work is pretty much cut out

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,520
for us yeah

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,119
just find me the guy who has proposed

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
the most number of blocks in the past

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
week

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
he probably has a lot of money will do

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,318
you're so smart robin let me go get

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,039
those names for you

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
oh man i'm so sorry robin it looks like

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
people don't use a simple proof of state

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,480
blockchain anymore

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,160
they seem to be using a privacy

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,720
preserving proof of state blockchain

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,959
privacy preserving proof of stake i am

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,440
lost what does that mean

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
let me explain

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
in a privacy preserving proof of stake

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,920
blockchain a party is able to prove

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
that it won the lottery without

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,519
revealing its stake

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
or identity this can be achieved using

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
anonymous verifiable random functions

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
and zero knowledge proofs we can only be

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,000
convinced

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
that a certain block was created by a

78
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,120
party

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
that won the lottery we have no idea who

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,200
actually won the lottery

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,599
okay okay all right no need to stress

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
this seems pretty easy enough i have

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,720
duped

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,480
many people in my time maybe i can

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
break these proofs and learn who the

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,200
winners are

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
no you cannot they use zero knowledge

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,519
that means

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,440
whatever you do you cannot gain any

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
knowledge of the witness

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
or the identity of the party okay

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,319
okay fine i'll be back i'm gonna go

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
online go to eprint

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
maybe get some answers oh wait wait i

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
see something

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,440
maybe i can uh subvert the crs

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,799
nope all right uh can i break the

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,480
commitment scheme or the verifiable

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
random function

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
nope not in this lifetime hmm

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
maybe i'll see the same proof over and

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,319
over and i can link those proofs

103
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,440
together

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
no these proofs are of course randomized

105
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
and you cannot tell

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,519
oh man this looks pretty difficult

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
how do i solve this problem

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
aha i have figured it out history has

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
come to the rescue yet again

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,680
remember how in the 1200s we would

111
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
see these fancy coaches on the street

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,959
and know

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
that there is some rich dude nearby

114
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,720
i'll do the same thing where

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
i simply observe the network to see

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
which ip addresses first broadcast a new

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,479
block

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,520
then by monitoring the ip addresses and

119
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
the number of blocks they propose

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,759
i can figure out how much take the party

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
owns

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
whoa that's pretty smart except you're

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
resuming a public network

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,639
where you can observe the source of

125
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
every message

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
but what if they use ideal anonymous

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,199
channels

128
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,880
how do you plan on resolving that oh man

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
what are these ideal anonymous channels

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,120
now

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
well they're channels that do not allow

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
any party to learn the source of a

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,160
message

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,759
you can receive a message from these

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,880
parties but you'll never have any idea

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,639
who actually sent it by the way

137
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,080
if you look at the functionality

138
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,039
carefully of course you can send

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
any messages anonymously but

140
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,600
you are also allowed to add

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,680
some delay to the messages that you can

142
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
see that are on the network

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,680
moreover you can also send

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,440
specific messages to specific parties

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
i see okay i think i understand

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,880
you're saying i can only see what they

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
carry i can only see what they carry

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
i can see what they carry though and the

149
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
only thing i can do

150
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
is delay the messages

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
john you've done it again what if i

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,440
could

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
actually influence what they carry and

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,520
then i'll know

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
which party carries what messages and

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
with that i'll learn the identity of the

157
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,840
blog proposers

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
okay i'm very confused what are you

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
talking about here

160
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,280
let me explain with an example so the

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,319
first thing i'll do

162
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,800
is create a red transaction and send it

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
to just mr bezos

164
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,400
then i'm going to create a black

165
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
transaction and send it to the other

166
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
guys

167
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
then i'm going to set some sort of delay

168
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
to the red transaction and the black

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
transaction

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,199
such that the red transaction is going

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,240
to be delivered

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
to the other guys only after

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
the delayed period and the black

174
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,479
transaction is going to be delivered to

175
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,919
mr bezos

176
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,199
only after the delayed period now

177
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
i wait and observe the next block on the

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,039
chain

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
if the block contains the red

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,080
transaction

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
i know that only mr bezos had that

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
transaction at that point of time

183
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
and therefore that block has to have

184
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
come from mr bezos

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,960
now i can continue doing this in each

186
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,759
round

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
and i can just sit back and observe the

188
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,960
blockchain

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
to see the frequency with which mr bezos

190
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
has won the lottery and created

191
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
blocks on the chin well that's pretty

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,599
interesting

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
so basically you're leveraging the fact

194
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,639
that even if a sender

195
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
can be made anonymous using these idle

196
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
channels you can somehow determine

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
what it hears and therefore what it

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,960
speaks by leveraging the delay on the

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
network

200
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
i have a question for you here though

201
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,919
how exactly are you ensuring

202
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,400
that the message sent to mr bezos is not

203
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,039
immediately relayed to the other parties

204
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,479
in other words how are you implementing

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,080
this delay

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
well that's exactly what we need to

207
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
figure out next tell me what blockchain

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
protocols these guys use on the network

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
layer

210
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,599
well as far as i know it's probably a

211
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
fork of the zcash blockchain

212
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
so we can just check out its code and

213
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
figure out how to mount your attacks

214
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,199
ah well look at this paper from miller

215
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,000
at all

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
that is something similar in a proof of

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,039
work setting

218
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
we can implement a similar in blocking

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,479
technique

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
to ensure that different parties receive

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,240
different messages

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
at least for a little bit let's refresh

223
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,720
our memory on how

224
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
the network works so let's assume that

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,400
this

226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,319
is the network topology and let's focus

227
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
on a specific part of the network

228
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
so we consider musk bezos and gates

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,760
let the buffer of musk have transactions

230
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
1 2 and 3

231
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
bezos has 6 4 2 and 3 and gates

232
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,679
only has four two and three

233
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,200
now suppose musk

234
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
wants to relay a transaction to bezos

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,480
he first sends an inventory message with

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,040
the hash of the transaction to bezos

237
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,640
bezos responds with the get data message

238
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
since he does not have transaction 1 in

239
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
his buffer

240
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
musk then sends transaction 1 to base

241
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
bus

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,360
now alternatively assume that when bezos

243
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
is waiting

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
for the transaction from musk gates

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
sends him an inventory message for the

246
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
same transaction

247
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,800
musk in this case simply ignores this

248
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,199
message

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
also if gates were to receive an

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,519
inventory message for a transaction that

251
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,120
is already in its buffer

252
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
gates would simply ignore this message

253
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
now let me talk about my attack how i

254
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,519
would mount this attack is

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,160
let's first set the black transaction to

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,640
be

257
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
a transaction and the red transaction to

258
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
be an empty message

259
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,760
the first thing i would do is send an

260
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,279
inventory message for the black

261
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,040
transaction to all three parties

262
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,399
then i will receive a get data

263
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
from these guys because they have not

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,160
seen this black transaction before

265
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
i will then respond with the black

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,279
transaction

267
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,800
only to bezos and musk

268
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,839
and not to gates

269
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
in the meantime if gates were to receive

270
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
an inventory message for the black

271
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,079
transaction from a the mask of bezos

272
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,760
he's going to ignore it since he is

273
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,079
waiting for the get data response

274
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,600
from me now from the z cash code we know

275
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
that the timeout

276
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
for this weight of this get data is two

277
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
minutes

278
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,360
and a block is added to the zcash

279
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
blockchain

280
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
every 75 seconds this is an enough delay

281
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
for me to ensure that different parties

282
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
receive different messages when they are

283
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
going to propose

284
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
a blog on the chain

285
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,320
well john looks like we've done it now i

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
can clearly know the iep addresses

287
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,560
of the rich guys i am going to hack into

288
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,440
the computers

289
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,519
steal their keys and give all the money

290
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,079
to the poor

291
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,800
meanwhile at the headquarters of privacy

292
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
preservatives proof of stake

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
blockchain is limited we meet two

294
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
developers who are in an intense

295
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,640
conference meeting

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
i hear from my sources robin hood has

297
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
found a way to de-anonymize folks

298
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,320
on the privacy preserving proof of stake

299
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
chain what can we do

300
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,959
yes it looks like he's leveraging the

301
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,560
delay to ensure

302
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,839
different parties have different

303
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
messages and then by just observing the

304
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,839
next block on the chain

305
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
he is trying to identify which party has

306
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,880
won the block

307
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,720
won the lottery this is this is crazy

308
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
yeah off the top of my head it seems

309
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
like we need to ensure

310
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,640
that different parties do not receive

311
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
different messages

312
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,360
well we could use some kind of reliable

313
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
anonymous broadcast

314
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,519
that ensures that each party maintains

315
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,079
the same buffer

316
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,279
we could ensure that even if robin tries

317
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,079
to confuse

318
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,240
the parties with different messages they

319
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
will have the same buffer

320
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
they might have some unconfirmed

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
transactions but with enough

322
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
communication

323
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,639
they will all maintain the same buffer

324
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,079
hold up if we can do that then aren't we

325
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
already achieving consensus

326
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,839
and do you even realize what you are

327
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,160
asking for you want all parties to

328
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,920
communicate with each other so that they

329
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
get the same buffer

330
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
and in some sense you are also asking

331
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,760
that the synchronous delay

332
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,800
b zero this is not feasible we need a

333
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,439
better solution

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,360
well maybe we don't need all parties to

335
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
participate

336
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
what if we had a trusted set of parties

337
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,240
who did a reliable broadcast among

338
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,120
themselves

339
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
and created a buffer of transactions for

340
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,040
the network to use

341
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,839
the proposer would then use this buffer

342
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,560
to create the next block on the chain

343
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,440
in fact i know of a paper from ndss 19

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
called saber

345
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
which uses trusted relays to forward

346
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,000
messages

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
and blocks to all parties on the network

348
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,040
wow

349
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,000
this sounds pretty interesting but who

350
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,040
are these nice guys who want to help us

351
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
and why do we trust him what if

352
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,360
robin is in cahoots with these guys and

353
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,079
mounts the same

354
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,120
attack as above he could just create

355
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
different transactions send it to

356
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,959
different parts of the network

357
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
and then observe which transaction made

358
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,959
it to the blockchain

359
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,839
and thereby de-anonymize that party

360
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you're right maybe we can select them

361
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
based on stake

362
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
and since we're in the proof of stake

363
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
setting we are guaranteed

364
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
an honest majority nice

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
that seems like it could work except

366
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,160
these parties would be revealing their

367
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,199
stake

368
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,519
and therefore be a direct target for

369
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
robin to attack

370
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
we could incentivize them perhaps but

371
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
it's not really clear

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
why parties would forgo their privacy

373
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,760
for the system

374
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
oh man you're right it doesn't look like

375
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
there are any trivial solutions to this

376
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
problem

377
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
but thank goodness this paper is being

378
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
presented at

379
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
s p in 2021 and 2040

380
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
is pretty far away let's hope the

381
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
security community

382
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
comes together to resolve this problem

383
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,359
by then

384
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
to summarize in this work we present an

385
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,160
attack leveraging the network

386
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
delay to de-anonymize parties in

387
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
privacy-preserving professional

388
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
blockchains

389
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,639
we also present a formal attack on a

390
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
modified version of oraboroscriptionist

391
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
when paired with idle anonymous cells

392
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
we note that since these attacks are in

393
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,199
the network layer

394
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
just mitigating them with application

395
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
layer solutions is not trivial

396
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
at least for us the details of this work

397
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,920
are present at this link
