00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,199
hi everyone i'm chen ling i'm glad to be

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,000
here on behalf of my collaborators

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
to present our paper a first look at

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,519
zoom bombing on snp 2021.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
in 2020 society has found itself

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,720
increasingly relied on online meeting

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,600
tools due to the covenanting pandemic

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
with many business meetings online

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
classes and even social gatherings are

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,119
moving online

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,439
unfortunately the mass adoption of these

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,240
services

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
has also enabled a new kind of attack

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,559
where perpetrators join any deliberating

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,280
disrupt virtual meetings this phenomenon

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
has been called zoom bombing

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
in this paper we performed the first

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
measurement study

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
of course for zoom bombing attack on

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,879
social media

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
we learned how zoom bombing attacks are

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,920
called

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,120
for and how they are carried out our

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
studies has been widely reported

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
and have strong security implications

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
based on previous studies on coordinated

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,360
online aggression

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,479
we consider a zoom bombing attack

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,760
as being composed of four phases in our

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,880
threat model

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
we describe the four phases in detail

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
through an example

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
in which charlie is orchestrating a

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
coordinated attack

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,720
against a zoom meeting created by alice

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
phase one call for attack charlie

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
obtains information about ali suma

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,000
meeting

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,560
as we will show later this is often

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
because charlie

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
is a legitimate participant of the

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,720
meeting

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,920
for example charlie is a student

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,720
in an online lecture charlie then post

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
information about

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
zoom meeting on the online services of

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
his choice

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
in a way of starting an organization

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,960
thread

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
he asked other members of the community

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,479
to participate

52
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,240
in the coordinated attack phase two

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
coordination the organization threat

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
created by charlie now becomes an

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,439
aggregation point for the attackers who

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,318
will report

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,720
additional information and coordinate

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
attack by replying to the threat

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,599
for example attackers will post details

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,879
like a password

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,720
to access the meeting or personal

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,160
information about host

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
phase 3 delivery the attackers will then

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
join the online meeting and harass the

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,319
participants

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,200
for example sending them hateful message

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
shouting profanities

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,599
or displaying of some offensive or

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,720
indecent image through their webcams

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
phase 4 harm the goal of the tech

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
is to cause harm to the group of people

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
depending on its success and

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
intensity victims could suffer serious

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,879
psychological

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,920
or even physical harm

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,879
we monitor links to 10 online meeting

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,760
services like

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
zoom google meet cisco webex

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
and microsoft teams we focused on two

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
online services to collect posts

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
that contain online meeting information

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
a mainstream social network like twitter

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,319
and a friend web community like 4chan

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,519
between january and

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
july 2020 we identified 12 000 tweets

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
and 434 4chan threads discussing online

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
meeting rooms

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
because automatically identified calls

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,360
for attack

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,000
is challenging we build our code book

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
and perform annotation to identify

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
posts that contain online meeting

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
information

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
the coding process has two steps first

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,879
we perform a binary labeling to

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,400
determine if posts

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,360
are indeed cause for zoom bombing or not

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
at the second step

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
we further categorize the posts and the

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,840
threads

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,159
that contain zoom bumping invitations in

102
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,439
four aspects

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,319
thread structure link information

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
imitation information and interaction

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
with the goal of understanding the

106
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
behavior of attackers

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
and the target that they choose

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,799
finally we identify 1234 chance threats

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
discussing such attacks as well as 95

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
tweets

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
we analyze them using quantitative and

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,839
qualitative analysis

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,320
we provide analysis in the following

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
four aspects

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
which services are targeted the most by

116
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,520
zoom bombing

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
how zoom bombing unfolds temporarily

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,639
what

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
is characteristics of zoom bombing links

120
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
at last we use natural language

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
processing techniques

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
to quantify the content of zoom bombing

123
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
thread

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
regarding the target services we

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,240
observed that the platform with a larger

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
user base seems to be attracting more

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
zone volume attack

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
such as zoom and the google meet for

129
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,280
temporal analysis

130
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
this figure plots the weekly occurrence

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,960
of bombing and

132
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,160
non-bombing posts on twitter and 4chan

133
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
generally speaking zone bombing other

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
phenomenon barely

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,080
exists before the quarantine we observe

136
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
a decline of the phenomenon in june 2020

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,039
potentially linked to the school

138
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
holidays

139
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,120
this is in the line with the fact that

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
we observed that most

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
course of zone bombing target school

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,160
lecture

143
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,840
and college classes

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,440
we find the 16 bombing invitation on

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
4chan

146
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,360
and the 67 ones on twitter

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
include a password this is a worrying

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,560
trend

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
since it is an indication which we will

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,919
see

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,120
our qualitative analysis later too

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
that many attackers are called for by

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,120
the insiders

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
who have legitimate access to the

155
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,400
meetings

156
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
questioning existing security measures

157
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
and calling for re-thinking them

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
for content analysis we train a

159
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319
work-to-vac model to visualize the

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,440
result

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
for this analysis zoom bumping

162
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
invitation in 4chan thread

163
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,560
and the twitter post words are linked

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
if the cosine similarity of their vector

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,720
embedding is higher than

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,759
a certain threshold meaning that they

167
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,720
are used in

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
a similar context we use the roving

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,000
community

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
detection and algorithm to identify the

171
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
themes of words

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
looking at the fortune graph at the left

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
we can see that many of the same feature

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,639
educated topics such as the red

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
community with spanish

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,039
course and skype and the proper

177
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,880
community with university

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
college and classes on the right graph

179
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,080
of

180
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
twitter we can again see the same data

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
over cover online classes such as the

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
green communities with classes

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
history and a mess

184
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
photographs for the non-bombing threats

185
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
unfortunate and non-bombing tweets on

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,960
twitter

187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
the same are more valid our quantitative

188
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
analysis highlights several interesting

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
aspects of zone bombing invitation

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
and in their discussion we then dig

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
deeper into our qualitative analysis

192
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
result to get

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
a more knowledged view of the

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,520
characteristics of the zoom bombing

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
phenomenon

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
informed by our quantitative results

197
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,960
based on the threat model

198
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,240
we analyzed as attacks across the four

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
phases

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,639
call for attack coordination delivery

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,319
and harm

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
in the first phase cover attack an

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,599
attacker posed

204
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,160
a call for an attack on an online

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
platform

206
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
in addition to information that can be

207
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
directly extract from the url of the

208
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
bombing link

209
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
many bombing posts include additional

210
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
text indicating that online classes are

211
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,080
the target

212
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
for example lecture teacher classes

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
show up regularly in this thread we

214
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,039
found that

215
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,319
77 zoom bombing thread on 4chan

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
target online classes on twitter we

217
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,039
found that 59

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,240
bombing course target schools

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,199
then we look for two indicators as the

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
evidence of insider's complicity first

221
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,639
years

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,240
whether the language of the call for

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,280
attack suggests that the court is

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
called by any insiders and the second

225
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
is whether the people who

226
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,639
call attack shares knowledge about the

227
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,360
meeting that

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
only an insider would have attackers

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
telling people to adopt certain names

230
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
to avoid vetting so together with

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
all the information from both meeting

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
links and the post text

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
we identify 70 zone bombing threads on

234
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,679
4chan

235
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,160
that appear to have been posted by

236
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
insiders

237
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,160
for twitter we found that 82 zone

238
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,839
bombing tweets were posted by insiders

239
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,120
while 100

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
threats did not start with an invitation

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
of the bombing 46 percent of these

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
received no further replies

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,160
such as the core of an attack seemed to

244
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,040
have

245
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
being stubborn after posting an

246
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,279
invite to a zoom bombing attackers

247
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,120
coordinated to carry it out

248
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
we found that 93 bombing links

249
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,240
unfortunate and

250
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
98 link on twitter came along with a

251
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,959
clear implication

252
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
that meeting was live at the time of

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,800
posting

254
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,279
we find sixteen percent threats

255
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,760
unfortunate one user openly refused to

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,279
join into the attack

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,920
after chrome nypa not your personal army

258
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
just indicate that not all users on

259
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,959
4chan

260
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,880
are willing to participate in these

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
attacks this is interesting because

262
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,680
it is a possible explanation for at

263
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
least some failed attacks

264
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
users do not reply because they reject

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
the idea of being a troll

266
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,080
in the services of another user

267
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
in this phase the attackers join the

268
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
online meeting and

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,079
begin their harassing and disruptive

270
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:04,800
actions

271
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,519
we find discussion of how the attacks

272
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,399
went down

273
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,640
in replies within the bombing threat

274
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,600
unfortunate

275
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
we compare the time interval between

276
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
when the link is posted

277
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
and the first feedback on the attack we

278
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
find 30 percent of

279
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
threats with clear feedback related to

280
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,360
the bombing

281
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
according to this analysis a zoom

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
bombing attack finished within 20

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,079
minutes

284
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
for 20 stress we find the participants

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,680
reporting problem

286
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,279
with the zone bombing invitation

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
finally we want to understand the toxic

288
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
speech that happens during attack

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
we find eleven percent four change zone

290
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
bombing threat

291
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,440
containing toxic contact including

292
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
racism sexism

293
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,760
or hateful words on twitter we did not

294
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
find any toxic tweets

295
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,839
in our data set we can't see what

296
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,399
happens

297
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
in the meeting room therefore crime

298
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
scene feedback is useful

299
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,279
we find 12 stress containing feedback

300
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,440
from the zone bombing attack providing

301
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,720
us a better view

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
of what's happening during this attack

303
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
it's time to wrap up our first

304
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,120
conclusion is the majority of the cause

305
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
of zoom bombing in our data set target

306
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
online lectures

307
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
we find evidence of both university and

308
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
high school being targeted

309
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
secondly we find most calls for zoom

310
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
bombing come from insiders

311
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
who have legitimate access to the

312
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
meetings this is a very serious

313
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,079
security implications because it makes

314
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,959
the password

315
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
ineffective to protect meeting from

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,279
attackers because they can share them

317
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,079
with whoever participants in the attack

318
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,279
in some cases

319
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
we find that insiders share additional

320
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,519
information like the names of

321
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,760
real students in a class allowing

322
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
participants to select those names

323
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,079
and make it very difficult for teachers

324
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,639
and moderators to identify the

325
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,480
intruders we also find that

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
almost all the zoom bombing target

327
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,760
meetings happening

328
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,079
in real time suggesting zone bombing

329
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,279
posts cannot be

330
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,560
identified ahead of time and leaves no

331
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,560
time for the defenders to prepare

332
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,920
our findings have important security

333
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,959
implications

334
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
because it makes common protections

335
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,320
against zoom bombing

336
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560
such as password and setting up a

337
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
waiting room ineffective

338
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
restricting meeting participants to

339
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,839
belong to a single

340
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,399
organization may be effective but this

341
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,920
reduce the usability

342
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,639
of the meeting room providing a unique

343
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,200
link

344
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
for each participants reduce the chances

345
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
of success of zoom bombing attack

346
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
if the meeting service still allows

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
multiple people joining

348
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
with the same link at least just give

349
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,839
some

350
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,680
accountabilities since the meeting host

351
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,000
can

352
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,720
identify who shared the link based on

353
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
the unique link

354
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
used by the attackers to join an even

355
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
better mitigation

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
is to allow each participants to join

357
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,200
using a

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,240
personalized meeting link in this way

359
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,120
as long as the insiders join the meeting

360
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,240
unauthorized

361
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
people cannot able to join using the

362
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,639
same link

363
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,600
we encourage online meeting platform to

364
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,000
adopt

365
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
access control measures to protect their

366
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,040
meeting from the insider threats

367
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,680
thank you for your attention
