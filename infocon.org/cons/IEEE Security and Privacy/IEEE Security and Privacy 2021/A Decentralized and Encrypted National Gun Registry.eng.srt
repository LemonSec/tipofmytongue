00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,800
hi i'm lucy and i will be sharing our

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,880
work on a decentralized and encrypted

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,200
national gun registry

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,639
in the united states while we've been

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,559
dealing with this pandemic the epidemic

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,400
of gun violence has worsened

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
particularly in the past month of april

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,000
this has captured more of our national

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,560
attention

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
as we've witnessed what feels like one

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,160
high-profile tragic shooting after

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,720
another just since march 16th when eight

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
individuals were killed in a racist

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,240
attack against asian american women in

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,960
atlanta

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
there have been at least 50 mass

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,119
shootings we've also seen an uptick in

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,800
gun violence of every kind

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
and increasing support for gun control

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
measures as well as recent legislative

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
focus on addressing gun violence

22
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,879
today i'm going to talk about one

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
legislative proposal addressing gun

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,559
violence in our work in assessing its

25
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,760
feasibility

26
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,360
but i wanted to say up top that we're

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,800
not claiming that technology will

28
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,039
magically solve anything or that any one

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
policy can fix gun violence

30
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
we recognize that this is underpinned by

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
much deeper issues for example those

32
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
related to racial justice

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
healthcare or economic disparities the

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
focus of this talk is on a specific

35
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,519
legislative proposal drafted by senator

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
wyden's office

37
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
for a decentralized and voluntary

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
national gun registry

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
that explicitly guarantees data privacy

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,560
and local control over data

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
this was also envisioned as part of

42
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,159
broader gun control laws and to help

43
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
support a background check system

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,759
as well as assist with the gun tracing

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,080
process currently if an unidentified

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
firearm is found and more information

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,520
is needed the process involves

48
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,799
physically searching through file

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
cabinets in boxes full of forms

50
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,799
as shown in these images and this on

51
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,400
average takes four to seven business

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,479
days of which only sixty-five percent of

53
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,000
traces can be answered

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
and this inefficiency is intentional

55
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
under the firearm owner protection act

56
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,680
of 1968

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
we actually can't have a centralized

58
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,799
national gun registry

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,640
which this decentralized proposal would

60
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
not violate

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
but as a whole we currently do not have

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
an efficient means for tracking the sale

63
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
and ownership of firearms

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
when senator wyden's office approached

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
us with this idea they had a specific

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
question they wanted to ask

67
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,719
they were curious whether a

68
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,479
decentralized encrypted national gun

69
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,640
registry could be possible at the scale

70
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
of the united states and if the

71
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
legislative requirements they had

72
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
conceived could actually translate to

73
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
concrete cryptographic protections

74
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,239
our role as cryptographers was to answer

75
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
these specific questions about this

76
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,720
specific piece of legislation gun

77
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,560
violence is an extremely complex issue

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
with different avenues for making change

79
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
and this includes addressing the

80
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
underlying issues that lead to gun

81
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
violence or passing statewide reform

82
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
therefore we recognize that federal gun

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160
reform is only one piece of this puzzle

84
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,599
and one that has been prone to

85
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,959
stagnation

86
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
so when we first began this project our

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
expectation was not necessarily that the

88
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,640
system would be instantiated

89
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,239
our hope is that our work helps to

90
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
foster a dialogue about what trade-offs

91
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,280
are possible

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,519
in realizing a national gun registry for

93
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,360
when and if there is a right time to

94
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
have this conversation

95
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
so to begin i'm going to discuss at a

96
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,879
high level what a system like this would

97
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,480
look like

98
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
a key property is that all of the data

99
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,239
is encrypted and locally managed

100
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
for a single state such as california

101
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,080
each county would designate a local

102
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
official who holds a key

103
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
this is used to encrypt license and

104
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,360
registration data for the county which

105
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
is stored in that county's own encrypted

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
database

107
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
each state operates a server which

108
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,599
stores all of the encrypted local

109
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,200
databases for the counties

110
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,120
its only role is to store data and to

111
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
maintain its availability

112
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,720
all of the counties then send their

113
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,799
databases to the state server

114
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,640
and if we abstract this out we have the

115
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
california state server which holds data

116
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
for some number of its counties

117
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,159
and around the country for each

118
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,760
participating state there would be a

119
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
state server holding local data for all

120
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
of its counties as well

121
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
and each state will have varying numbers

122
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,959
of local officials with new ones

123
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,840
choosing to opt

124
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
in or opt out at any point together this

125
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
composes a gun registry that is a system

126
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
of decentralized locally managed

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
encrypted databases

128
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
that can be queried by authorized users

129
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,080
around the country

130
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
now that i've talked about the

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
high-level goals i will address the

132
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,319
system requirements based on the draft

133
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
legislation

134
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,519
one each county designates a local

135
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,040
official who is responsible for an

136
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
encryption key

137
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,319
two the encryption key is required to

138
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
view query update and encrypt county

139
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
data

140
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,159
three authorized users are permitted to

141
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,000
query the system for registration and

142
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
licensing data

143
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
and this might be a detective or local

144
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
official from another state who wants to

145
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,358
perform traces

146
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
or a distributor who might want to see

147
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
if an individual has a valid license

148
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
before purchasing a gun

149
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,720
four attempts at collecting large

150
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
amounts of information are prohibited

151
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,639
and this will be regulated at the county

152
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,400
level based on factors that they have

153
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,759
determined

154
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
five authorized users must be able to

155
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
make queries even if the designated

156
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
local officials key is offline

157
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,560
for some pre-specified amount of time so

158
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
this is necessary since different

159
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,919
regions vary in levels of internet

160
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,800
connectivity

161
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
and if there were to be unstable

162
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
internet connection data from the county

163
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,000
should still be accessible

164
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
i won't be covering this today but the

165
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
details are in our paper

166
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,560
six once a key has been offline beyond

167
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,240
that pre-specified time period

168
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,919
data print hating to the county should

169
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
be completely inaccessible

170
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,759
and this just allows counties to opt out

171
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,199
of the system without affecting the

172
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
ability of other counties to participate

173
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,560
to realize these system requirements we

174
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,919
leverage the following cryptographic

175
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,960
building blocks

176
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
secure two-party computation structured

177
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
encryption and secret sharing

178
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
security party computation or 2pc allows

179
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,600
for the computation of a function over

180
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,039
private inputs from two different

181
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,840
parties while producing a public output

182
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
structured encryption allows a user to

183
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
encrypt a data structure

184
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
store in an untrusted environment and

185
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
perform private search queries on top of

186
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,000
that data

187
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
and this is done by using the encryption

188
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
key to generate tokens that are specific

189
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,400
to a query these tokens are sent to the

190
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
server who then returns the response

191
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,960
without knowing what the query was

192
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
seeker sharing allows the party to split

193
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
some secret into what are called

194
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
shares these shares can be used to

195
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
recombine the original secret based on

196
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,560
some

197
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,479
thresholds but the shares on their own

198
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,479
do not reveal any information about the

199
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,840
actual secret itself

200
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
not even partial information there is

201
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
precedent for national gun registries

202
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
but none with the same set of security

203
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,400
and privacy guarantees outlined here

204
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
canada operated a national gun registry

205
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,160
and a key criticism was that the data

206
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
was centralized

207
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
new zealand passed legislation in 2019

208
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
for the creation of a registry and

209
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
individual states in the u.s also have

210
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
their own versions of registries

211
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
there are also some superficial

212
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
similarities with federated encrypted

213
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
databases such as conclave and sm sql

214
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
these are two systems that also leverage

215
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
secure computation for private query

216
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
execution over

217
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,880
databases but in their systems the query

218
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
is evaluated on the union of data held

219
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,319
by all data owners

220
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
whereas here once a database is

221
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,919
identified the query only needs to be

222
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,840
evaluated over a single data owner's

223
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,360
data i will now describe our protocol

224
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,039
but wanted to add that it's one of many

225
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
ways to fulfill the requirements of the

226
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,599
legislation

227
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,360
the system however received positive

228
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
feedback from members of senator wyden's

229
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,000
team

230
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
in the interest of time i will be

231
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,599
focusing on the querying process

232
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
the full protocol is described in the

233
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,639
paper

234
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,319
so panning back out to the scopal view

235
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
we have all the state servers who hold

236
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
encrypted local databases

237
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
an authorized user with a query may

238
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
already know which county to make their

239
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,319
query to

240
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,759
and the use case of a distributor

241
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
looking for licensing data but a user

242
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
trying to perform a trace would not know

243
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,759
which county a gun originated from

244
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,360
and to prevent against this worst-case

245
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
scenario of having to query every

246
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
database in all 50 states

247
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,840
we introduced an encrypted global

248
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,479
directory

249
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
this encrypted global directory contains

250
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
key value pairs of serial numbers

251
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
and county ids we want to store this

252
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
information in a centrally accessible

253
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,280
place

254
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
but we do not necessarily trust a server

255
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280
to have access to this information

256
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
therefore we encrypt it using a

257
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,440
structured encryption scheme

258
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
we introduce two custodians whose role

259
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
is to hold shares of an encryption key

260
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,360
for the encrypted global directory and

261
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
to be online to service requests

262
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,680
let's say a user has a request for

263
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
county id corresponding to a serial

264
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,479
number

265
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,919
the user first secret shares their

266
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,520
serial number into two shares

267
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
one for each custodian the custodians

268
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
then participate in a two pc for

269
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
generating a query token for the user to

270
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,039
be able to retrieve the county id

271
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
the custodians begin by inputting shares

272
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
the serial number and key into the two

273
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,639
pc

274
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,240
as the first step the serial number and

275
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
key are reconstructed

276
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
they then serve as input for the

277
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
encrypted global directory's token

278
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,319
generation function

279
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,400
and this comes from the structured

280
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
encryption scheme

281
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,120
this produces a decryption key and token

282
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
the key and token are secret shared and

283
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,240
then outputted back to the custodians

284
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
the custodians then pass the decryption

285
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
key share to the user who reconstructs

286
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,039
the key

287
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,880
the custodians also pass the token

288
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
shares to the server

289
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
the server now that it has the token can

290
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,959
return the cipher text containing the

291
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,920
county id

292
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,760
and using their decryption key the user

293
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,519
can now decrypt and obtain the county id

294
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,519
so going back to this view the user now

295
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
knows which county to query in order to

296
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
receive the full record they're looking

297
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,240
for

298
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
at this stage the user can now make a

299
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
direct query to a specific

300
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,360
encrypted local database so just to take

301
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,720
a look at these encrypted local

302
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
databases each record in a database will

303
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
contain some basic information about a

304
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,399
gun owner and their firearm and this

305
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,120
might include

306
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,760
the owner's licensing id and in

307
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,120
additional information on the gun

308
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
a user can then make different types of

309
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
boolean queries on this data such as a

310
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
simple query with just one single

311
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,440
keyword

312
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
or more complex destructive or

313
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
conjunctive queries these are some

314
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
examples of queries but based on a

315
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
county's rate limiting practices

316
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
these queries might be invalid depending

317
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
on the volume of records returned

318
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
so to begin the querying process the

319
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,880
user has some query queue and the local

320
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
official has a key

321
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
these two parties must participate in a

322
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
two pc so that the user's query and the

323
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
local officials key are both kept

324
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,959
private in the two pc the query and key

325
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,440
serve as

326
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
inputs for a token generation algorithm

327
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
that comes from the encrypted local

328
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,279
databases structured encryption scheme

329
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,560
this then produces a query token the qpc

330
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,079
outputs the token to the user who

331
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
forwards it to the state server

332
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,519
and the state server then returns an

333
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,360
encrypted result corresponding to the

334
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,000
query

335
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
in order to decrypt the ciphertext these

336
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,360
two parties need to participate in

337
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
another two

338
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
pc the inputs here are the cipher text

339
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160
and the key

340
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,079
first a decryption key is generated

341
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
using the record id of the cipher text

342
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,600
and the officials key

343
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,279
this decryption key is then used to

344
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,800
decrypt the cipher text which is

345
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
returned to the user

346
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
the user now has the record in plain

347
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
text and this concludes the querying

348
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,360
process

349
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,800
i wanted to point out that the local

350
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
official does learn the number of

351
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,800
ciphertexts inputted into the 2pc

352
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,959
but nothing about the contents they can

353
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,800
then conduct rate limiting by refusing

354
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
to decrypt if the number of cipher texts

355
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
is too high

356
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
there could also be additional checks

357
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,959
that are added into either of the two

358
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
pcs for more sophisticated rate limiting

359
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,480
moving on to security the legislation

360
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
implicitly defined trust relationships

361
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
that we extracted and formalized into a

362
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,200
threat model

363
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,959
we only consider security against

364
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
semi-honest adversaries and construct

365
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,640
security in the ideal real world

366
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,360
paradigm

367
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
where we make comparisons between the

368
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
execution of our protocol in the real

369
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
world in the execution

370
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
of an ideal gun registry functionality

371
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
we tolerate the following corruptions

372
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
which we categorize as external or

373
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,399
internal for external we tolerate the

374
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
corruption of the server and one of the

375
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,959
custodians

376
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
for internal at most one local official

377
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
a full proof is in the extended version

378
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,279
of this paper on eprint

379
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
an important piece of this work was to

380
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,800
evaluate if this was even possible at

381
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
the scale of the united states

382
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
we therefore implemented the protocol

383
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
end to end and then ran experiments

384
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
based on the estimate of the number of

385
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
guns of the united states

386
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,839
we also did a basic cost analysis to

387
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,760
confirm the financial feasibility of

388
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,959
running a system like this

389
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
and that's also in the paper i wanted to

390
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
highlight a few metrics starting with

391
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
the encrypted global directory

392
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
here we have the number of serial number

393
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
county id pairs that are

394
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,160
already in the encrypted global

395
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
directory on the x-axis

396
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
this shows that the time it takes to add

397
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
a single pair into the directory is

398
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
independent of the number of items

399
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,399
already stored

400
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,839
we were interested in looking at what

401
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,760
happens when there are 400 million pairs

402
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,519
in the global directory since that's the

403
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,079
number

404
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,160
of guns estimated to be in the united

405
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,680
states according to the small arms

406
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,480
survey

407
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
and it would take 377 milliseconds to

408
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
add a pair with 400 million pairs

409
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
already in the directory

410
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,399
the time it takes to find a county id is

411
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,160
also independent of the number of pairs

412
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,120
in the directory

413
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
and on average it takes 247 milliseconds

414
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,120
to find a county id

415
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,440
with 400 million pairs in the encrypted

416
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,279
global directory

417
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,040
and moving on to the encrypted local

418
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
databases it would take less than four

419
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
minutes to add a hundred thousand record

420
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
as for query performance the query time

421
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,959
depends on how complex a query

422
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,800
is and the number of records returned as

423
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
a result of the query

424
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
this chart shows that it takes less than

425
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
a minute to respond to a query that

426
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
returns 100 records

427
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
a query returning this many records

428
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
likely would not be valid but we

429
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
included this metric as a demonstration

430
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
of the performance of the system

431
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
as shown to pc decryption time encompass

432
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
almost all of the query time

433
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
lastly for storage it would only require

434
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,880
110 gigabytes to store 400 million

435
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
serial number to county id pairs in the

436
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,959
encrypted global directory

437
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,639
using the set of keywords previously

438
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,560
shown which included basic information

439
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
about a gun owner in a firearm

440
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
it would take 1.7 gigabytes to store a

441
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
local database with a hundred thousand

442
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
records

443
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,279
before i conclude i wanted to

444
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,120
acknowledge that introducing a protocol

445
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
designed specifically for data

446
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
collection by law enforcement does have

447
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
the potential for abuse in the case of

448
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
driver license and license plate

449
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
databases

450
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,399
they've been used beyond the intention

451
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,760
of their collection for targeted

452
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
deportations by ice

453
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,279
and facial recognition algorithms by the

454
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,320
fbi

455
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
we kept this in mind when thinking about

456
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
how the data stored could be misused

457
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
while we can't control how this protocol

458
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
would be deployed if it were to ever be

459
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,639
deployed

460
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,560
we strongly advocate for policies and

461
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
regulations that limit personal data

462
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
collection by law enforcement

463
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,560
and full transparency on access control

464
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
new developments and cryptography

465
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
as a whole can enhance privacy but the

466
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,079
use of privacy enhancing technologies

467
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,000
can also be used as cover to request

468
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
access to more data

469
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
therefore we believe that policies and

470
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
laws that specifically outline and

471
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
communicate clearly to the public

472
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
what kind of data can and cannot be

473
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,199
collected before a system is built and

474
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:19,839
deployed

475
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,800
would help deter potential for abuse to

476
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
conclude we designed

477
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,560
implemented and evaluated an end-to-end

478
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,160
encrypted national gun registry

479
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,720
explicitly using draft legislation

480
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,959
this work shows that it is possible and

481
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,800
practical to run a system like this at

482
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,440
scale

483
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,959
and in working with senator wyden's

484
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,560
office we hope that this collaboration

485
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
will encourage more of its kind between

486
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
policy makers and technologists

487
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
we'd like to also thank their office for

488
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,519
sharing this draft legislation

489
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,839
and for providing valuable feedback and

490
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,519
thank you all for listening to this talk
