1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,720
hello everyone and welcome to the talk

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,400
breaking the specification

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
pdf certification my name is simon and

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
this was a joint work with vladislav

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,639
christian and york

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,320
we are all researchers at whole

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,719
university boho

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,960
in the next 50 minutes we talk about pdf

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,279
certification and how to use features

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,560
and certification

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
to change the content in a certified

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,959
document

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,840
we start with the basics and take a look

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,199
on the pdf structure

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
incremental updates talk about the

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,840
differences between site and certified

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
documents

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
and take a look on the permission levels

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
in certified documents

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
so on the right side you see a simple

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,760
pdf document and each pdf document start

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,800
with the header

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
so the header defines a pdf version

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
the header is followed by the body and

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,440
contains objects of the pdf document

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
with unique object numbers so it starts

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
with the object of type catalog

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,360
which reference to the pages object

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
and the pages object reference to all

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
pages in the document

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
as you can see there's only one page in

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
the document so we

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
only have one object of type

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
page so the page reference to the

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
contents of the document or the page

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
so you see in object number four

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,159
there contains a stream and within the

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,880
stream

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,280
there's the text of the pdf document and

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
starts with contract

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,720
the third part of a pdf document is a

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
cross reference table

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
or expert table it

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,759
holds the entries or the byte offsets of

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,479
the object

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,520
defined in the body so as you can see it

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
starts with one

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
followed by four this means the

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
first object is object number one

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
followed by four entries

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
so as you can see there's a 10 and 10

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
means the byte of set 10

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
so object number one starts at byte

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,920
offset 10.

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
the last part of a pdf document is a

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
trailer the trailer reference to the

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,360
root object

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
so the root object is of type catalog

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,920
and defines a byte offset of the cross

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
reference table

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
so in this example the cross reference

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,920
table start at byte offset 191

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
and these four parts build the whole pdf

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
document

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,200
if you want to change the content of a

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,480
pdf file

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
or add new content we do this usually

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
within an incremental update so this

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
means only the modification

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
are added to the end of the pdf file

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
within an update

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
but the original pdf content remains

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
unchanged

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
so on the left side you see a simple pdf

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
file and now we want to add

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
an incremental update we do this by

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,159
adding a body update a cross reference

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
table update and a trailer update

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
and these three parts build the

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
incremental update

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
so if we want to sign a pdf document

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
we do this within an incremental update

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
and these incremental update protects

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,720
the document

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
so there's a small part containing the

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,040
signature value which leaves unprotected

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
so if we now want to add an annotation

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
to a signed pdf document

89
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,159
we do this with another incremental

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,120
update

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
soon as you can see the annotation part

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
is now unprotected

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
so let's talk about signed pdf documents

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
if you want to sign the simple pdf

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,799
document

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,120
we do this within an incremental update

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
so as you can

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,879
see here we see the revision one is

99
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,799
signed by ceo

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,959
but we are not limited to one signature

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,439
we can also add another signature

102
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,560
so in update 2 we add the revision 2

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
which is signed by ceo2

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
and we also can add annotations but if

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,720
we want to add an annotation

106
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
like here not for public release we see

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,720
there is in the signature part of the

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,879
document we see there's an annotation

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,199
created with a warning

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,279
so signed pdf documents there are

111
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
multiple signatures are possible

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
until assigner explicitly locks the

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,479
document and

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,639
adding an annotation leads to warnings

115
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,600
but are not blocked

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
so in certified documents the

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
certification must be added before

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,880
signing the document

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
this is because the certification sets a

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
permission level

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,479
p1 p2 or p3 for the whole document

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,360
so in certified documents up to the

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
permission level

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
additional signature our annotations are

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,919
allowed

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,800
or prohibit so let's take a look on the

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
difference between signed and

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
certified documents add or change

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
visible content is not allowed in a

130
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,080
signed or

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
certified document but you can fill out

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
forms

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,120
in certified documents p2 or p3

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
and inside pdf documents this usually

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
leads to warnings if you do not add a

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,560
signature at the same time

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,199
but adding multiple signature is also

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
allowed in site pdfs

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,639
and on certified documents at level p2

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,479
and p3 adding annotations

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,320
leads to warnings the most pdf

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
application when we do this within sign

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,360
pdf but is allowed on a

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
certified document at level p3 so on the

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
right side you see a certified document

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
and a signature was added and an

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
annotation was added and we see on level

148
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,360
p3

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,919
there's no warnings when we add an

150
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,240
annotation

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
so let's start with the attacks on

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
certified documents we start with the

153
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
evil annotation attack um we use

154
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
annotations to add to hide content and

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
certify documents

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,199
and we take a look on the user interface

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,199
layers ui layers

158
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,680
and we improve the stealthiness of the

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
eaa

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
so for in eaa you need a

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
certified document on level p3

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
so adding or changing annotations is

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,639
allowed

164
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
and annotations can be placed anywhere

165
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
in the documents the pdf

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
specification does not restrict the

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,440
position or size of an

168
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
annotation so we can add an annotation

169
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
as big as we want

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,440
and two annotations can overlap each

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
other

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,120
the pdf specification 2.0 defines

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
26 annotation types and 18 of them

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
are allowed to be used in a certified

175
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
document

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,919
so as you can see on the right side we

177
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,080
categorize them by the danger level

178
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,720
so danger level high means you can add

179
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
text or images

180
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
to the certified document so for

181
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
annotation free text and redact you can

182
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,319
add text

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
and for notation stamp you can images

184
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120
at the level medium it means you can

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
hide images or text in a certified

186
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
document but you cannot add

187
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,680
new content and on level low you only

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,000
can

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,960
add icons to the certified documents

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
so how to use eia to change a content in

191
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
a certified document

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
we first use the annotation type stamp

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
to hide content with a white image so we

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
place a white image

195
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,919
above the text we want to change

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,599
after this we add a free text comment or

197
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
a free text annotation

198
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
to add text chosen by the attacker we

199
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,960
place this

200
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
over the stamp and now we got

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
our content placed in the document

202
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
as you can see we can add content to a

203
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,479
certified document without

204
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,879
warnings in ui layer 1 which is always

205
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,199
displayed when the document is opened

206
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,400
and no warnings in user layer 2 which

207
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
must be opened by the user and provide

208
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
more detailed information about the

209
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,199
signature certification

210
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,160
but we have to look at another ui layer

211
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,039
the ui

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,840
layer 3 which holds a list of

213
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
annotations added to the document

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
and this layer 3 must be also opened by

215
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,520
the user

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,919
but it makes the modifications

217
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,360
detectable for the user

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
so let's improve the stealthiness of the

219
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,880
array

220
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
we first have to find objects of type

221
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
anode

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,360
you see we have two objects of type

223
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
anode here

224
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,320
which hold a value a subtype value of

225
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
stamp or free text

226
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
so the next step we have to change the

227
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
subtype to null or one that is not

228
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
specified by the specification

229
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
so we set this to null as you can see

230
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,040
and

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,440
now the ui layer 3 holds an empty list

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,720
so this is how we improve systems of eaa

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
let's take a look on sneaky signature

234
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,839
attacks

235
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,320
our goal is to use the signature to add

236
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
and hide content in a certified document

237
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
and we take a look on the structure of

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
signatures

239
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
and on top we show how to improve the

240
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
statusness of ssa

241
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,880
the sneaky signature attack is possible

242
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
on level p2

243
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,279
and p3 because this level allows to add

244
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,000
a signature to a certified document

245
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
and the visible part of the signature

246
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,320
can be placed anywhere in the document

247
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
and the pdf specification does not

248
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,480
restrict the position or size of the

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
signature

250
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,839
and also signature can overlap each

251
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,959
other

252
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
on this slide you see the visible part

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
of a signature

254
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
as you can see there is a graphical part

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,959
and also a text part

256
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
and both parts can chosen by the

257
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
attacker

258
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
so let's use ssa to change content in a

259
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
certified document

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
we first have to add an empty signature

261
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
file over the content to be changed

262
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
we can do this manually or using tools

263
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
like apache pdf box

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
which is a java library to modify or

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
sign pdfs

266
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,839
so in the next step we have to create a

267
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,040
visible signature

268
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,519
with a white background image and text

269
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,760
chosen by the attacker

270
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
in the last step we have to insert the

271
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,519
signature to the empty signature files

272
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,839
so now we have placed attacker choosing

273
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
content with certified document using

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
signatures

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
but this leads to a problem so as you

276
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
can see on ui layer 1

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
and ui layer 2 depending on the pdf

278
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
application

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the attack is detectable

280
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,920
so let's improve the statusness of ssa

281
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
in the first step we have to find the

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
object of file type sick

283
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
so as you can see we find file type 6 in

284
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,920
the object number 7

285
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,959
and object number 7 contains a reference

286
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,160
to the page object

287
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,600
p to the object 3 and

288
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
the validation reference to number 8.

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
the object 8 contains the signature

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
value

291
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,959
so in the second step we have to change

292
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,240
the reference

293
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
of the page object to our own signature

294
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
object

295
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,440
this means we change the reference 3

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,680
to 7. so in the next step

297
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
we have to interrupt the signature

298
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,079
validation and we do this by changing

299
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,760
the referenced v to the next higher

300
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,160
object number so in this case we change

301
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,800
the

302
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,680
value 8 to the value 9.

303
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
but this leads to another problem as you

304
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,160
can see

305
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,720
the signature field is now interpreted

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,279
as an

307
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,480
empty field so to prevent the signature

308
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,560
field from being interpreted as an

309
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
empty field we have to mark it as read

310
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
only

311
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,120
and we do this by adding double f1

312
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,880
to the signature object seven

313
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,399
so now the signature field will not be

314
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,440
interpreted as

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,519
an empty one so we finished our

316
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,560
improving the stealthiness attack on ssa

317
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
so as you can see no signature is here

318
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
in ui layer 1

319
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,639
and no signature is on your eye layer 2.

320
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
so let's have a look on the evaluation

321
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,959
and the vulnerable pdf

322
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,200
applications we categorized them by the

323
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
ui layers

324
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,959
we analyzed 26 pf applications on three

325
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,200
different operating systems

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
so on the middle part you see the

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
specification flaws

328
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
this means the attacks without improving

329
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,639
the stealthiness

330
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
on the right part you see the

331
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,959
application flaws this means the attacks

332
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,160
with improving the statins we categorize

333
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
them by the ui layers one two and three

334
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
and a full cycle means the attack is

335
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
undetectable on the ui layer

336
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
a semicycle means the attack is

337
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
undetectable on the ui layer but the

338
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,160
general

339
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
notification is shown an empty cycle

340
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
means the attack is clearly detectable

341
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
on the ui layer

342
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,160
as you can see the application flaws

343
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,519
help to increase the number of

344
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,279
vulnerable applications

345
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,560
for example ssa on

346
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,959
ui layer 2 the number of vulnerable

347
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,760
applications increased from 0 to 9

348
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
if we improve the stair sinus and

349
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,800
we see the same for eia on ui layer 3

350
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
where the vulnerability vulnerable

351
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,240
applications increase

352
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,440
from 0 to 50.

353
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
so what is the conclusion and the

354
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,360
lessons learned unprotected updates are

355
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
still a big problem in certified

356
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
documents and also in signed pdfs

357
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,680
and supposed harmless features like

358
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,519
signatures or annotations

359
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,279
can be used for evil things like adding

360
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,160
content to a certified document

361
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
so the specifications should be updated

362
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
adding signatures should only be allowed

363
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
in a predefined signature

364
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,639
fields defined by the certifier before

365
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,959
the document is certified

366
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
and annotation should be limited so

367
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,079
there's no reason

368
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
why we can add an image as big as a

369
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
whole page or add

370
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
content like text to the to the

371
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,720
certified document

372
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
using a white list would also help to

373
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
reduce implementation flaws

374
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,639
