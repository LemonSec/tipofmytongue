university

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,879
uiuc the radar research i do research

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
and the inception recently

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,239
autonomous driving or 80 vehicles are

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
increasingly deployed on public roads

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
for an id system perception is no doubt

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
one of the most critical tasks for safe

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,760
driving

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,559
among various perception tasks the most

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,559
important and the safety critical one

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,120
is involved obstacle detection such as

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
detecting from cars

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,159
pedestrians traffic cones or barriers

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,960
error in such tasks can directly lead to

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
violent crashes

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,280
for example the uber accident in arizona

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
and the tesla accident

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,520
in taiwan due to such direct safety

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,240
impact

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
virus previous work have studied the

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,360
security of

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
ad inroad obstacle detection

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,960
however all these existing work are

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,520
limited to attacks on a single source of

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
ad perception

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
for example cameras are light up is the

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,799
ad perception alone

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
by contrast production high level 80

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,000
systems such as

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,920
remote jam cruise widely adopted

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,200
multicenter fusion or

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
msf with ad perception different sensors

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
have different sensing capabilities

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,720
thus the core idea behind msf is to

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,159
leverage the stress

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
and compensate the weakness of these

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,360
sensors to achieve

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
overall higher accuracy and robustness

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,159
so far the most popular msn

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,000
fuels sensor data from lidar and the

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
camera and the state of the art design

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,040
are dn based

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
considering its recent superior

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
performance in such design

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
assuming not all perception results are

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
all can be attacked simultaneously

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
theoretically it is always possible to

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,200
rely on the

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
attack source to detect or prevent such

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
attack

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
such physical security design assumption

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
is believed to hold in general

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,080
that's why msl is widely recognized as a

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
general defense strategy against the

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,519
existing attack

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,640
id perception however

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,879
if we look back our such conclusion

72
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,480
depends on this very basic

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,599
security design assumption this does

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,879
naturally lead to a

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,200
fundamental research question can such

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
basic security design assumption

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,800
actually be broken especially in

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
practical ed settings

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
to answer this question there are

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
several research challenges to address

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,959
first lack of a single physical world

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,200
attack vector effective for both camera

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,440
and

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
lighter based led perception second near

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,959
to differentiably synthesize physically

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
consistently attack impacts

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
onto both camera and lidar third need to

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
handle non-dependable pre-processing

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
steps in ad perception

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
let me detail this in the following

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
slides

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
first let's talk about the problem for

93
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
relation and attack goal

94
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,840
we targeted on physical water tax vector

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,319
for high practicality and realism

96
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
considering its basic security design

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,959
assumption we aim at designing an attack

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
that can effectively attack all

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,000
perception source

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
used in the msl based led perception

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
which means camera plus collider for

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
today's popular design

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
this allowed us to directly challenge

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,519
the basic security design assumption

105
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
and for the first time allowed us to

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
gain a concrete understanding of how

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
much security guarantees the use of

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
msf can fundamentally provide as a

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
general defense strategy for led

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
perception

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
as for our cargo we aim at filling the

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,000
msl based ad

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
perception in the victim 80 vehicles to

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
fail in detecting a frontal

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,519
obstacle and thus crash into it to

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,319
achieve this

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
the very first challenge is the choice

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,840
of attack vector

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,799
in our case it is ideal if we can find a

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,560
single physical world attack vector

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,478
effective for both camera and light

122
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
based led perception

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,320
which can save attack deployment costs

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
and thus improve the practicality and

125
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
stealthiness however currently no

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
previously used attack vector showing

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,919
effectiveness

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
for both for instance adding color

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
pattern to obstacle or low surface can

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
affect the camera but cannot affect

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
later and shooting laser have shown to

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,479
be

133
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,000
effective for lighter basically

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
perception but its effectiveness for

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,280
camera with

136
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,119
led perceptions remain unclear

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,759
to address this we identify adversaries

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,720
with the object

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
as a physical world attack vector

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
against a massive base led perception

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
our insight is that different shapes can

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
affect both punch precision chains for

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,639
lidar and a pixel value transfer camera

144
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,360
such an attack is physically releasable

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
with today's 3d printing technologies

146
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
such an attack can also achieve high

147
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
stiffness by mimicking a normal traffic

148
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,320
object

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
such as travel cone or barrier but with

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
broken look

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,960
or weird looking rock to achieve our

152
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,520
goal

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
the attacker can place an object on the

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
roadside to trick the victim id vehicle

155
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
to crushing

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
it to cause serious crashes the attacker

157
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,039
can fill

158
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,160
a 3d printed object with dense materials

159
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
for example the green is our metal to

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,199
make it harder and heavier

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
or leverage the semantic meaning of a

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
certain road object

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
types such as the travel cones for

164
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,080
example

165
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,960
place some nails or glass debris behind

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,000
other side traffic

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
cooling objects so that feeling to

168
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,560
detect it can lead to terror blow out of

169
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
a targeted 80s vehicle

170
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
before jumping to our design details

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
let's first watch some video demos of

172
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,880
our attack

173
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
the first one is a miniature skill

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
physical world that have

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,120
where we use real camera and lidar by

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,840
the setup

177
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
the loading environments in a smaller

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
scale we choose traffic cone as the

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,199
object type

180
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,400
and 3d printed the binary and the other

181
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,280
one generated by our attack

182
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
here as you can see this is the printed

183
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,400
auto-thorough traffic cone

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
here is a 3d printed binary triangle

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,520
coil in small skill

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
left is the camera wheel on the right is

187
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
the ida view

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
as you can see it can generally be

189
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,680
detected by both camera and

190
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
lidar

191
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
now is the case for 3d printing or those

192
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
are traffic code

193
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
as you can see we put it in the same

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,160
position and

195
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,720
follow the same movement in the camera

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
and the lighter views

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
its pattern looks pretty similar to the

198
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,120
binary case

199
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,440
but in this case it can never be

200
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
detected by both camera and ladder in

201
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,639
any of these frames

202
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,319
we also have an attack demo using real

203
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,120
vehicles

204
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
with rather than 64 line ladder and the

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,160
camera

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,039
here we use the box as the binary object

207
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,280
and

208
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,919
3d printed the third one generally from

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,960
such finishes

210
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,198
which end up like a strange looking rock

211
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,319
here is a 3d printed autosar object left

212
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
is lighter view and the right is camera

213
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
view

214
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,880
now we drive forward as you can see the

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
same as the traffic cone case it can

216
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,039
never be detected by both camera and

217
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,680
ladder

218
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
any of these rims

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
we also have an antoine attack

220
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
simulation demo

221
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,919
here is a load in rg as well open source

222
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,319
production with ad simulator

223
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,160
and here is a vehicle running by the

224
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,440
apollo 5.0 and industry grade 80 system

225
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
and here is the binary and the star

226
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,878
travel cone we will import

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
this is the binary case left is a

228
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,039
simulator view and the right is

229
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
80 system wheel the traffic coin is here

230
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,599
in the roadway

231
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,840
as you can see the ad system can

232
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
successfully detect it and

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,800
safely stop before it

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,199
now comes to the other server case we

235
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,639
put the adobe server at

236
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
exactly the same place but in this case

237
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
the ad system can never detect it in any

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,559
of these frames and thus

239
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,760
eventually crash into it

240
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,919
now let me detail how our attack design

241
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,120
works behind the scene

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,000
which called msf adv to systematically

243
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
generated altera objects

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,080
will adopt optimization based method

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
like many player works

246
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,880
here is what we have we have an initial

247
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
benefit to the object mesh

248
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
say for travel cone the point called an

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
image of target loads and

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,839
msf algorithm we need to first generate

251
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,959
the msf

252
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,200
algorithm input basically the camera

253
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
image and the light upon cloud of

254
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
traffic load with objects somehow

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,000
put inside and then use the greeting to

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
update the shape of 3d object match

257
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,640
to iteratively generalize the solar

258
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,920
volume

259
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,080
here a challenge is that we need to

260
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
defendfully synthesize physically

261
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
consistent attack impact onto both

262
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
camera image and the ladder point clause

263
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
to address this we use differentiable 3d

264
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,279
rendering

265
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,279
for example a customized version of

266
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,880
recasting for lighter

267
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,360
and an existing technique called nmr for

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
camera

269
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
which are both differentiable however

270
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,120
with this we are not done yet

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
as there is another common step before

272
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
the msf algorithm

273
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
in the production device that is

274
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,200
pre-processing

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
for example i agree with the feature

276
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
calculation and the region of interest

277
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
filters

278
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
this is another challenge that we need

279
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
to handle non-differentiable

280
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
pre-processing steps in 80 perception

281
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
especially for the lidar set let me

282
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,399
detail this a little bit

283
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
state-of-the-art database object

284
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
detection method popularly use cell

285
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
level aggregate feature to improve

286
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,800
runtime

287
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
algorithm performance for example let's

288
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
say there are

289
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
raw leather pumps to generate such

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
feature a pre-processing staff

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
will first group them into 2d or 3d

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
cells

293
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
and then calculate the cell level

294
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,240
features such as

295
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,279
occupancy count height

296
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,839
intensity and density

297
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
in order to calculate this feature the

298
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
necessary first step is to perform what

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:38,560
we call

300
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,440
font inclusion or pi calculation which

301
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
calculates whether an

302
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,920
input function is inside a cell or not

303
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,160
such a property is discontinuous by

304
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,720
nature

305
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
to achieve differentiability our

306
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
strategy is to first

307
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
design a normal and accurate

308
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,600
differentiable function to

309
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
approximate pi calculation or soft pi

310
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
and then you'll use it as a building

311
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,000
block to achieve differentiable

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
computations

313
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
of features we mentioned earlier to

314
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,079
achieve

315
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,200
such soft pr calculation our key idea

316
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
is to estimate the probability of such

317
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,720
from inclusion using interpolations

318
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
we tried different information functions

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,279
such as tri-linear and tangent edge to

320
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,680
improve the accuracy more details can be

321
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,079
found in our paper

322
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,800
we also have other designs for example

323
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
improving robustness

324
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
to different victim approaching position

325
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
and angles

326
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,399
stealthiness and physical world

327
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,320
reliability

328
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,800
now it's time to talk about evaluation

329
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,279
we evaluate some four msf algorithms

330
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,000
included

331
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
in two open source food stack ad system

332
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,959
apollo and

333
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,519
autofill.ei we select three object types

334
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,480
with 100

335
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
real-world driving scenarios from kd

336
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,639
dataset for the effectiveness

337
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
we achieve over 91 percent success rate

338
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,519
across different object types and

339
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,399
msf algorithm we also evaluated the

340
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,399
robustness against different public team

341
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,760
positions and angles

342
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
find over 95 percent average success

343
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,639
rate

344
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
also we found high transferability

345
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,240
across different

346
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
msf algorithms with around 75 average

347
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,760
success rate

348
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
we also evaluate the physical world

349
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,959
reliability

350
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,720
which is demonstrated before your

351
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
miniature skill and a real vehicle-based

352
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,920
setup

353
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
and found at least 85 percent attacks

354
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
are saturated across different frames

355
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
we also perform end-to-end attack

356
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
simulation evaluations which is also

357
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
demonstrated before and found

358
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
our attire can achieve 100 percent

359
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
collision rate across 100 runs

360
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
we also developed many other properties

361
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,279
such as baseline attack comparison

362
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,600
stealthiness printability and different

363
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
attack settings

364
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,719
which are more detailed in our paper

365
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,440
last but not least we also made efforts

366
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
on evaluating and discussing defenses

367
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,279
there are two general different

368
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,320
directions first then based defense

369
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,279
we experimentally evaluate 6 popular

370
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
existing input and a model level

371
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,240
difference method

372
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
the master effective one reduce the

373
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
attack success rate to 66

374
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
without harming b9 performance however

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
it is not quite enough to render our

376
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,399
attack

377
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,519
practically unexposable in practice

378
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
this means that we need to explore more

379
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
effective design in our problem settings

380
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
especially for those with strong

381
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
guarantees such as automotive training

382
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,200
and certified robustness another

383
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
direction is to feel small perception

384
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
source

385
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,399
for example fields with small camera or

386
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
ladders mounted at different positions

387
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
or including reader in msf

388
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
this cannot fundamentally defeat our

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
attack as the shift change can still

390
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,360
simultaneously affect this sensory input

391
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,279
however this may make our attack more

392
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,440
difficult to generate and thus could be

393
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
a practical mitigation

394
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
we did a responsible vulnerability

395
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,360
disclosure and as for april 25th

396
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
we have informed 31 companies that are

397
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,079
deploying or testing id vehicles

398
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,519
among them 17 how will reply and start

399
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
investigation to conclude

400
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
at a high level the most important

401
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
contribution we did is to perform the

402
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
first study on security of msf

403
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
based idea perception challenging the

404
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
basic security design assumption in

405
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
practical ed settings

406
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,880
we design a normal attack address wells

407
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,519
challenge

408
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,760
conduct intensive evaluations and also

409
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
perform responsible vulnerability

410
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
disclosures

411
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
with that thank you for your attention

412
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,839
and i am now open to questions
