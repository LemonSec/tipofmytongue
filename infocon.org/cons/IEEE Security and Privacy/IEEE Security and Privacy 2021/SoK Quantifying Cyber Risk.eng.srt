00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,319
hello

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,799
i'm daniel woods i'm a postdoc at the

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,160
university of innsbruck

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,200
in the austrian alps and today i will be

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,000
presenting

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
our systemization of knowledge about

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,079
quantifying cyber risk

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,960
so to use your time efficiently we split

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,680
our talk

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
into two sections the first part is a

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,800
tutorial on our causal model

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
of cyber risk which we later use to

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
systematize the literature

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,920
the second section explains what we

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
learned from our survey

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
of empirical cyber risk papers

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
so in trying to explain the causal role

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
of security interventions

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,559
a natural law might go something like

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,760
the more security

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,320
an entity has the less harm they will

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,280
suffer

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
this is almost true by definition and we

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
can describe this visually

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
with the negative sign denoting a

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
negative relationship

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
namely more security leads to less harm

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,720
yeah in the literature we find results

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
with the opposite relationship

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
for example zen and bola find that

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
higher security budgets are associated

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,320
with

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
higher frequency of data breaches so

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,159
this seems to contradict our natural law

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
but we can explain this result

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,159
via confounding variables so we

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,119
illustrate this

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,439
with artificial data showing the same

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,640
results

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
the line of best fit shows that entities

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,680
who invest

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
more in security tend to also suffer

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,920
more harm

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,840
so we don't believe it's the case that

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,439
security investments

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
cause greater harm rather we think

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,360
entities who

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
anticipate more harm will also invest

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,840
more in security such entities face

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,079
a higher threat level and we use this

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,439
term to capture

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,719
the motivation capability and activity

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,320
of adversaries so separating these

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
observations by threat levels

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
illustrates this entities with higher

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
threat level

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,878
which we depict in red tend to invest

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,319
more in security

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
than entities with a lower threat level

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
now if we fit a separate line of best

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,879
fit

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,440
for the high threat population we see

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,000
the result

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
we expect more security is associated

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,760
with

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
less harm this suggests a statistical

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
model of cyber risk outcomes

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,840
should include variables in addition to

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,160
security

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
this follows because an active threat

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
actor

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
is the only necessary condition for harm

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,920
to occur

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
thus the cause of harm is the threat

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,360
hector

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,040
not the security level so the backbone

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
of our model should be a positive

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
relationship

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
between threat level and harm which can

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
be seen here

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
however all hope is not lost

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,239
interventions exist that can reduce

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,440
expected harm for a given threat level

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
and we call the sum of all such

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
interventions

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,159
the security level here we have the

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
expected relationship

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
for a given threat level a higher

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
security level

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
leads to less harm in this sense

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
security moderates the relationship

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
between harm and the threat level

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
there are also interventions that can

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,879
increase expected harm

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,440
an example of such an intervention is

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
retaining more personal data

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
of customers or potentially giving more

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
employees

99
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,760
administrative credentials

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
we call the sum of all such

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,120
interventions

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,760
the exposure level and here we have

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,159
again

104
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,040
a positive relationship in which more

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,920
exposure

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,799
is associated with more expected harm

107
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
for any non-zero threat level

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
so this is a great model in theory

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,080
but it faces two practical problems

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,640
first

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
these variables are difficult to measure

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,400
and second

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,839
few studies include all of the variables

114
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,320
so we now describe how we extend this

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,358
basic model

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,560
to address these concerns so first

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
the measurement problem intuitively

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
we know that implementing security

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,120
controls

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,000
improves the security level thus the

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,400
seductive approach to measuring security

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
is to enumerate

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
observe and aggregate all controls

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
that cause lower harm for a given threat

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
level

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
unfortunately it is impractical to

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,440
measure

128
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
all such controls not least because

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,479
they're constantly changing

130
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,040
we argue instead it's better to think of

131
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
each control

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
as an indicator of an observed security

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,560
level

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
thus more secure organizations are more

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,960
likely to implement

136
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,479
each control so a given control

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,560
provides information about the overall

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
security level

139
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
regardless of its causal impact

140
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,720
for example two-factor authentication

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,280
does not

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
mitigate web vulnerabilities however

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
organizations who implement two-factor

144
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
authentication

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
are also likely to conduct more rigorous

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
code review

147
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
that reduces the likelihood of web

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
compromise

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
clearly such relationships are noisy

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
a given security control may be

151
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
implemented by

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
an insecure organization while also not

153
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,039
being implemented by

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,160
an otherwise secure organization

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
this statistical noise can be overcome

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,199
by making

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,759
many measurements and aggregating the

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,880
results

159
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
the more measurements the better in the

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,639
language

161
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,680
of structural equation moderate modeling

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
the measurement of each control is a

163
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
reflexive indicator

164
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,319
of the later variable namely the

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,880
security that level

166
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
this provides a pragmatic way of

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,240
measuring

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,199
organizational security without needing

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,160
to observe

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
every control so the second practical

171
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,400
problem

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
with the simple model is that very few

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
studies collect both

174
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
indicators of preventative security and

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
also indicators of harm let alone

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,600
linking the two

177
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
statistically so mitigation studies

178
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,600
focus on preventative security which

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
covers interventions like for example

180
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,880
patch management typical studies of

181
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
preventative security

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
link it to indicators of compromise like

183
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
botnet infections compromised web

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,160
servers

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
or whether a data breach occurs but this

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
ignores harm outcomes like

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
the dollar cost of a cyber insulin this

188
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,479
is why

189
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,120
in this model we replace the harm

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,919
variable

191
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,199
with a compromised variable so

192
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
turning to cyber harm's studies and

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,840
we find that these studies

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,960
try to quantify how harm varies among

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,319
a population of compromised firms

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,639
indicators of harm include the number of

197
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
records less than a data breach

198
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
or the loss in shareholder value

199
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,520
following a cyber incident

200
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
such designs can say nothing about

201
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,599
preventative security

202
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
because they only sample firms where

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,479
compromise is equal to one

204
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,840
so we have two types of studies one with

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,560
compromise

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,199
as the outcome variable and the other

207
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,479
with compromise as an

208
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,280
input variable thus it makes sense to

209
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,319
add compromise

210
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,800
as an intermediate variable to our model

211
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
this essentially splits security in two

212
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
there are those interventions that

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
happen before compromise

214
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,879
and those incidents that happen after

215
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,879
compromise which we call

216
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,360
preventative and reactive security

217
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,199
respectively

218
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,440
so in the same way we can also

219
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,240
differentiate

220
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,319
between the role of exposure before an

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
incident and also

222
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,720
after an incident so surface exposure

223
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,599
relates to

224
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
attack vectors used to achieve

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
compromise such as the number of

226
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,960
accounts with administrative

227
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
privileges whereas essa exposure relates

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,199
to factors

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
amplifying harm resulting from a

230
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,240
compromise

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
such as the volume of personal data of

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
customers

233
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,958
retained so this full diagram

234
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,080
is our causal model and so far

235
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
we have only provided a normative

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
contribution

237
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,839
explaining how we think the research

238
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,880
community should quantify cyber risk

239
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,920
so the next part of our talk outlands

240
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,800
what we learn

241
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
from the literature so we do the typical

242
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,080
sok thing with circles and semi-circles

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
by classifying each study according to

244
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,760
which arms of the causal model were

245
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
investigated

246
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
so for example here the first three

247
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
studies evaluated the

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,000
impact of notifying system owners about

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
vulnerabilities

250
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
but they did not link this to harm or

251
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
compromise outcomes

252
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,920
whereas the other two studies explored

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
all three variables

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,800
impacting the chosen and proxies

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,399
for compromise so our full paper

256
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,880
contained many more classifications

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,279
but given the time constraints here we

258
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,800
thought it would be more useful

259
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
to show the audience and what we learned

260
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
from the harm studies

261
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
as we believe you're less likely to be

262
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
aware of this work

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,480
so the harm studies tended to be

264
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
published at econ

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,279
and finance venues and they also had a

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,160
much longer

267
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
sample window which you can see in the

268
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
final column

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,680
so the most common study type quantified

270
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
stock market reactions to cyber

271
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
incidents

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
which is an indicator of harm and we

273
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,920
conducted a meta review of such studies

274
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
so this figure shows the size of the

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
market reaction

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
on the y-axis so a negative value is bad

277
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
for the victim firms

278
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
and we also show the sample window on

279
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
the x-axis

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,200
so studies of events from before 2005

281
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,240
found evidence of more severe negative

282
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
reactions

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
however this effect was less pronounced

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
in sample windows

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,680
including post 2005 incidents

286
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
some of the authors of these studies

287
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,040
suggest that this is because

288
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
corporate officers learned how to

289
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
release positive news

290
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
alongside data breach announcements

291
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,360
while other authors will report evidence

292
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
of insider trading so

293
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
this highlights a challenge with

294
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,079
measuring cyber risk

295
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,160
as soon as a measure like stock market

296
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
value becomes meaningful

297
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
entities adapt behavior to optimize the

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
metric

299
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,279
a separate question we should ask is

300
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
whether there's a meaningful difference

301
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
between a finding of minus 0.03

302
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
and minus 2.4 would this meaningfully

303
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,120
change

304
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
how organizations

305
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,680
manage cyber risk so a simple razor we

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,399
can use

307
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,680
is statistical significance more than

308
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
half of the tests

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,079
fail to reject the null hypothesis at

310
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,880
the five percent significance level

311
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
therefore we suggest that these

312
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
questions essentially struggle to answer

313
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
the yes no question

314
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
do cyber incidents lead to shareholder

315
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,360
heart

316
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
so the second most popular type of study

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
was analyzing data breach events

318
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,279
aggravated

319
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,800
in public repositories but rather than

320
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
uncover longitudinal trends additional

321
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
data breach studies which can be seen as

322
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
a form of replication

323
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
actually created contradictions so

324
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
the first data breach study found that

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
the frequency of data breaches was

326
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,040
increasing

327
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,720
over time the second confirmed this

328
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,519
and added the result the breach size was

329
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,440
stable over time

330
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
now the third introduced the first

331
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,760
contradiction the third database study

332
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
found that breach frequency is stable

333
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,959
over time

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,120
and the fourth finds that breach size is

335
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
increasing over time

336
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,040
the fifth that breach frequency is

337
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
actually decreasing over time

338
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
so we hope you can see the picture

339
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
that's building up here

340
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,720
additional studies don't confirm results

341
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
rather the application of more

342
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
sophisticated methods

343
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
led to differing and often contradictory

344
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
results

345
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
so we could not conduct a comparable

346
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,279
meta review for mitigation studies

347
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
because they tended to analyze very

348
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
different phenomena

349
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
therefore we struggled to distill any

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,839
actionable insights for decision makers

351
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
in terms of improving security decisions

352
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
this is partly because organizations are

353
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,959
complex systems

354
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
and it's often easier to get data about

355
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,000
the sub

356
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
components so for example a great

357
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,839
username to

358
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,120
use next 2015 paper studied which

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
websites would turn malicious

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
using a sample of 5 million websites and

361
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
it collected historic features via the

362
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
internet time machine

363
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
a different study of web server

364
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,279
compromise used a sample of 200 000 web

365
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,639
servers

366
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,040
a study of web hosting providers use the

367
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
sample of 45 000

368
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,160
and and this was even smaller for a

369
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,720
study of

370
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,120
end user device compromise which had a

371
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,000
sample size of

372
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
15 000 so

373
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,079
a study of malicious data breaches used

374
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,959
a sample of just

375
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,079
600 observations despite the fact that

376
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
organizations are mandated by law

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,560
at least in the u.s to reveal such

378
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
breaches

379
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
and this sample size fell to 265

380
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,680
breaches

381
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
when a study restricted this to breaches

382
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
with a dollar loss

383
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
notably this study relied on a

384
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,760
proprietary dataset

385
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
created by a company who crawl all

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
public reports of data breaches

387
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,120
and yet they only found 265 data

388
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,079
breaches

389
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,839
that publicly report the financial cost

390
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,040
so in conclusion we set about

391
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
trying to understand the state of the

392
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,240
art in quantifying cyber risk

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
yet 30 years of research has struggled

394
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
to even identify the effect

395
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
and causal direction of security we

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,519
started this talk

397
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
with a spurious result in which the

398
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
causal effect of security was

399
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
flipped we showed that stock market

400
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,440
reactions

401
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
often fail to establish statistical

402
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,959
significance

403
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,880
and that data breach studies often

404
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,399
contradict each other

405
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,480
in terms of relatively basic questions

406
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,519
about whether

407
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,680
data breaches over time are increasing

408
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
or decreasing in frequency

409
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
or size so our interpretation of the

410
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,959
literature

411
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,519
is that these failures to establish

412
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,160
knowledge

413
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
are rooted in two problems

414
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,320
omitted explanatory variables that are

415
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,279
compounded

416
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
by a lack of observations so

417
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,880
going forward we hope that our causal

418
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,680
model

419
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
helps the community to organize

420
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
assumptions

421
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
and efficiently uncover signal in the

422
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,800
noise

423
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,199
so we thank you very much for watching

424
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:53,519
this talk
