1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
hi everyone my name is dan patipka i am

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,160
a professor at tufts university and

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,200
today i'll be talking about some of the

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,319
work that my colleagues at the

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,320
university of maryland did titled hacked

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,080
pedagogical analysis online

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,960
vulnerability discovery exercises

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,320
so when we talk about vulnerability

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,599
discovery exercises these are

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,039
educational tools

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,039
where students presented with simple but

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,720
vulnerable challenge programs and their

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,359
goal is to

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
find and exploit the vulnerabilities in

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,880
those programs

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
and the benefit of these types of

17
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
exercises they expose students to a wide

18
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
variety of different classes

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,238
of vulnerabilities and give them

20
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,840
exposure that they can then take into

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
their

22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,399
secure development or vulnerability

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,800
discovery practice in the world

24
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,079
so why should we think about these from

25
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,920
a education perspective

26
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
well in fact these tend to be the

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,960
recommended

28
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
uh practice for security education or

29
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
some of one of the more common practices

30
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
for security education

31
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
uh in our prior interviews with security

32
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,440
professionals

33
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
we found that this tended to be the most

34
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,879
commonly

35
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,920
referenced method for learning

36
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,399
vulnerability discovery skills also

37
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:02,960
these

38
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
these types of exercises are recommended

39
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,200
by bug bounty platforms

40
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
such as bug crowd and hacker one to

41
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,960
people who are interested in

42
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,119
joining these these markets so these are

43
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,080
again this

44
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,720
recommended approach for security

45
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
education

46
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,960
so in this study we um we really wanted

47
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,759
to understand

48
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,720
from a higher level what these types of

49
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,080
exercises looked at

50
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,119
specifically we asked the question of

51
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
whether these exercises apply

52
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040
effective pedagogy taken from the

53
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
learning science and education

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,759
literature and how they go about doing

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,720
that

56
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
and then we also asked what challenges

57
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
exercise organizers face

58
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,320
uh in establishing the pedagogy for

59
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,079
their for the exercises

60
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
um we did this through a two-part study

61
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,600
first

62
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,640
we began with a pedagogical review of 31

63
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
online security exercises and then we

64
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
followed that up with interviews with

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
the organizers of those exercises

66
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,479
specifically 15

67
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,880
organizers for our pedagogical review

68
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
we looked at five core pedagogical

69
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,919
principles and several different

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,440
dimensions within each of these

71
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
and these are taken from the work by

72
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
bransford at all where they

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
performed a wide review of the education

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
and learning science literature

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
to establish sort of these best

76
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
practices for for pedagogy

77
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
and this was later operationalized and

78
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
though the work by kim and co

79
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
where they performed a pedagogical

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000
analysis of online coding tutorials

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
and so in our review we adapted

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
that that review from kim and co

83
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,040
specifically

84
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
uh around pedagogy to target security

85
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,280
education so

86
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
these online exercises after performing

87
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
our review we then emailed

88
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
our results to all of the exercise

89
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,440
organizers

90
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
and 15 of the organizers agreed to

91
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
participate in an interview with us

92
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
where during these interviews we

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
reviewed over all of the overall review

94
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
of the pedagogy of their exercises when

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
we asked them to identify anything they

96
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,959
have missed any

97
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,319
disagreements they might have with the

98
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
pedagogy that we chose so we could get a

99
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,040
deeper view

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
into sort of their decision making

101
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
process and understand

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
what went into sort of thinking about

103
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
developing these exercises from an

104
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,120
educational perspective

105
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
so in an understanding the decision

106
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
process and that's why they did what

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
they did

108
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,000
now for the rest of this talk for

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
gravity and focus on some of the most

110
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
interesting findings specifically the

111
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
pedagogical principles where organizers

112
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
reported challenges

113
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
and where future work is necessary to

114
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
better support these organizers

115
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
however before that i want to make it

116
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
clear

117
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,400
this is not intended to point fingers at

118
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,080
the failings of any of these exercise

119
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
organizers

120
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
in fact in our sort of review at a high

121
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
level we found that many of the

122
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,080
organizers

123
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
implemented many of the pedagogy we were

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
looking at

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,799
and that there were some really

126
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,080
interesting very creative

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
implementations

128
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,599
of these pedagogy throughout the

129
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
exercises so

130
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,879
in addition to the directions of future

131
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,400
work i'm going to talk about here we

132
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,360
also hope that the

133
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
the detail uh the much more detailed

134
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
review in the paper

135
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,040
provides a useful roadmap to future

136
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
organizers

137
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
by collecting all these ideas in a

138
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,399
single place and offering sort of

139
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
the ability to sort of build off of the

140
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,120
experiences of prior organizers

141
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
so with that in mind i'll begin by

142
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
walking through our results

143
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,120
by talking about how exercises organize

144
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
declarative knowledge

145
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
so to achieve mastery in a topic

146
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
students have to develop a rich

147
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
relational framework between concepts

148
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,960
and we specifically looked at

149
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,520
two ways exercises can guide students in

150
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
building this type of

151
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
structure or this mental structure first

152
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
thing we looked at is around

153
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
um this is the organization specifically

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
whether there were any

155
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,960
visual or structural cues organizing the

156
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,639
challenges and this goes beyond just the

157
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
high level categories that you might see

158
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
like cryptography or reverse engineering

159
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,560
problems

160
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
and down to a very specific relationship

161
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
between the specific concepts taught in

162
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,720
each

163
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
exercise we also looked at the context

164
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
within which the challenge was presented

165
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
things like was there additional lecture

166
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,160
material was there an overarching

167
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
project that was being completed any

168
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,919
kind of narrative or story

169
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
elements and whether or not it was

170
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
prevented in a realistic setting

171
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
this type of context can help students

172
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
remember particular things and apply

173
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,160
uh the things the concepts that they're

174
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,320
learning to to other settings

175
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
um as they try to transfer this learning

176
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
so in the organizational side we found

177
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,720
that

178
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
most of the exercises actually lacked

179
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,440
structural cues so these connections

180
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,919
between

181
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,120
challenges and this is especially true

182
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
when the the challenges were crowd

183
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
generated so anyone can submit

184
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,600
an exercise this type of model is really

185
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
beneficial because you can

186
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
provide a large number of different

187
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,639
challenges to students and give them a

188
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,080
wide variety of

189
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
concepts to be exposed to however

190
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,479
when we talk to the organizers they

191
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,199
point out this curating this type of

192
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:03,840
information

193
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,400
can can be really challenging when it's

194
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
all being provided

195
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
by several different individuals

196
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
and so coming up with a clear structure

197
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
is a really difficult task

198
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,759
for these organizers on the side of

199
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
context

200
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
one of the most interesting things we

201
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
identified here was just a few of the

202
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
exercises including any kind of

203
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
realistic challenges so these are

204
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
looking at programs where

205
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,880
the students asked to sort of work

206
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,840
through functions that might not

207
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,360
be part of the exploitable code where

208
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,080
they're trying to

209
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
sift through larger programs or

210
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,840
something like that

211
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,800
and this was actually intentional from

212
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
the the organizers

213
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,919
for example the organizers of the google

214
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,479
ctf said you focus mostly on the

215
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,599
problem-solving part

216
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,599
but it gives the player joy otherwise

217
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,840
it's mostly luck-based or developing a

218
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,240
lot of

219
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,280
infrastructure so here's the idea that

220
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
um you want to focus students on this

221
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
this particular concept and help them

222
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,479
like that

223
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,560
and not include a lot of sort of uh

224
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
extraneous load

225
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
now this could potentially be

226
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,039
problematic because

227
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,759
um students might not be able to develop

228
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
the skills necessary to transfer this to

229
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
real world programs we have um large

230
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
numbers of lines of code

231
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
but the the trade-off that organizers

232
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
felt was was best here

233
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
is to to focus um on these sort of

234
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,000
smaller code sets and then

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
not necessarily consider this realism in

236
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,039
every case

237
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,599
and so a point here for future work is

238
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,639
to understand well

239
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,440
what's the right amount of realism um or

240
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
realistic challenges can you provide

241
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
only a few and that's sufficient

242
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
do you need any so future work cannot

243
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
potentially consider that

244
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
the next thing we looked at was related

245
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
to practice and feedback

246
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,319
so whenever you're trying to help

247
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,160
students develop

248
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
practical knowledge it's important to

249
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,520
give them the ability to actively

250
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
practice sort of get hands-on

251
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
with with the concepts and then pair

252
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
that with tailored feedback so that as

253
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
students are working through and

254
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
investigating the problem

255
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
they don't go down rabbit holes and sort

256
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
of get stuck

257
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,000
and for this we looked at two dimensions

258
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
first actionability

259
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
students were students asked to exploit

260
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
insecure code and were they also asked

261
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
to write secure codes actually go and

262
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
fix those problems

263
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
and then for the feedback side we asked

264
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
whether or not feedback was provided

265
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
in context tailored to the student or

266
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,720
was it

267
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
given on demand the student had to go

268
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
and send an email or contact an

269
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,280
organizer via

270
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,279
a chat on the actionability side

271
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,080
we found that most of the exercises did

272
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
not include any kind of secure

273
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
development

274
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
practice and this was because as the xss

275
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
organizer

276
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
game organizers pointed out it's really

277
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
hard to test that the vulnerability is

278
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,399
fixed properly you can include some kind

279
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
of check

280
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
or some kind of test case that gets

281
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
evaluated when they make these fixes but

282
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,320
um actually fixing the underlying

283
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
problem can be really

284
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,480
um difficult to evaluate and so instead

285
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,959
of

286
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,320
actually helping students understand how

287
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
to write secure code you're just

288
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,399
teaching them

289
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
um to sort of code to the test and so

290
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
providing better solutions to help

291
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,279
automate this process and help

292
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,680
organizers evaluate secure development

293
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
was something that's

294
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,680
something that would be beneficial to

295
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
these organizers

296
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
on the side of feedback we found that

297
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
few exercises provided any kind of

298
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
correct path markers bringing this

299
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
in context tailored guidance

300
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,959
and the reason for this is again it's

301
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
it's very technically difficult this has

302
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
to be tailored to the specific

303
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
to the specific challenge and

304
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
each challenge is different and putting

305
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
all that effort in while you're also

306
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
trying to come up with unique

307
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,160
uh challenges can be very very difficult

308
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
so instead most of the organizers

309
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
provide feedback on demand students can

310
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,320
ask questions

311
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
and organizers will respond to those

312
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
questions and this is actually something

313
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,680
that the organizers pride themselves in

314
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
their ability to

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
buy feedback however this doesn't

316
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:06,800
necessarily

317
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
scale extremely well as you have many

318
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,240
more students

319
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
participating the next thing we looked

320
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
at was around metacognition

321
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,800
so this is the idea of helping students

322
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,360
think about their learning process

323
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
and the idea is that you can help

324
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
students develop a deeper understanding

325
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
by getting them to reflect on why the

326
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
solution is correct

327
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
if they understand why it's correct and

328
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
they can apply it to other

329
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,920
situations specifically we looked at

330
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
questions around transfer learning

331
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
so did the exercise teach how when and

332
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,560
why

333
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,040
a concept should be used in fact we

334
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,839
found

335
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,440
many of the exercises or a few of the

336
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
exercises explicitly discussed

337
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
when and why a concept should be used

338
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,839
and this was also um the metacognition

339
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
was specifically the pedagogical

340
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,279
principle that organizers reported

341
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,399
not being aware of in most cases and in

342
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,000
many cases whenever we talk to the

343
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
organizers they actually

344
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
um were really excited to implement some

345
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:04,959
of these

346
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,320
ideas and concepts into their own

347
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
exercises going forward

348
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,720
then the last thing we looked at was

349
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,839
around establishing a conducive learning

350
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,720
environment so in addition to the

351
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,079
content that's being provided to

352
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
students it's also important to

353
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
think about how that information is

354
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
being presented and how those concepts

355
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,800
are being taught

356
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
a negative environment hampers the

357
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
progress that students might make uh

358
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
someone is

359
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,760
disillusioned or becomes disillusioned

360
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
or feels pushed away they're much more

361
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
likely to

362
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
sort of abandon the the exercise whereas

363
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
a positive environment

364
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
has the opposite effect it can excite

365
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
and engage students and if they get

366
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,079
stuck

367
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,959
working on a hard concept they will

368
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,600
actually

369
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,320
be engaged and pushed to continue

370
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
working through that

371
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
and learn more through the exercise

372
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
so here we look at again two dimensions

373
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
first around peer learning

374
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,079
was there an active an online discussion

375
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,680
forum where students could learn

376
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
along with other students and then was

377
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
the terminology used

378
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,959
throughout the exercise descriptions

379
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,760
uh faqs places like that was it uh

380
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
supportive

381
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,600
of beginners on the side of peer

382
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
learning we actually found that

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
students can generally find a really

384
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,040
good community and

385
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,959
online forums around these exercises

386
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,079
even when the organizers didn't

387
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,920
themselves provide one

388
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,680
students themselves made them through

389
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
grassroots efforts and so

390
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
there were tended to be forums and

391
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,639
opportunities for students to learn and

392
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,000
collaborate together on the side of

393
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,040
inclusive

394
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
our inclusivity we found that most

395
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,560
exercises

396
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
used really good supportive terminology

397
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
in most cases however there were a few

398
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
cases where beginners were marginalized

399
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
for example and hack this

400
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
site the first challenge they provide is

401
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,680
referred to as the idiot challenge

402
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
and in its description says if you can't

403
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
solve it don't go crying to anyone

404
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
because they'll just make fun of you

405
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
um and this is problematic not just

406
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,880
because of um

407
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
even though there's there were very few

408
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
number of exercises that had this

409
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
this type of language um

410
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
this is the first exercise that a

411
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
student comes to

412
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,079
they might not only be dissuaded from

413
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
participating in this exercise but also

414
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
from participating

415
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,360
in security education more broadly

416
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
so um as we show through our sort of

417
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
pedagogical view and interviews

418
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,440
there's several sort of areas where

419
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,120
we as a sort of research community need

420
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
to provide some support

421
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,320
to organizers to help them

422
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,760
produce better security education

423
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
around things like metacognition

424
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
providing more structure around

425
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,720
exercises

426
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
providing secure development practice

427
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079
feedback and tailoring

428
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
uh feedback as well um so this this

429
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
requires uh innovation

430
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
and improvements of different uh

431
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,399
technology but also there are some

432
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,000
things we can take from the

433
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
um the literature and learning sciences

434
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
so for example around metacognition

435
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,920
uh one thing that exercises might go

436
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
about doing is probing the student's

437
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
mental model

438
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
for fronting the way that they think

439
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,839
about uh the program and where the

440
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,880
exploit works

441
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,519
before the exploit is actually executed

442
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,320
and this

443
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
helps them and this has been shown in

444
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
other domains to help students think

445
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,519
more

446
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,680
clearly about what's going on we also

447
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,120
identify trade-offs

448
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,040
around things like the difference

449
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
between realistic and

450
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
realistic challenges and extraneous load

451
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,199
as well as

452
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,199
uh providing a community or sort of

453
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,959
managing the community

454
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,040
and around that second point uh we think

455
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,320
that exercises can

456
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
improve by sort of incentivizing the

457
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,760
production of more educational

458
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,600
elements so in summary

459
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,519
i'd like to thank the nsf for funding

460
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,560
this research along with my

461
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
collaborators and exerciser organizers

462
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,519
who made this possible

463
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,959
i've included my contact information

464
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,320
without the slide and i look forward to

465
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,839
taking your questions and hearing from

466
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,800
you at the symposium
