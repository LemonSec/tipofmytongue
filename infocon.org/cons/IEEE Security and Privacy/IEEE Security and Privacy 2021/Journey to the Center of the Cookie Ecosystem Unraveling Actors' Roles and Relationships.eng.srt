00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,560
hi my name is iskander sansedrola

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,000
and today i'm going to present journey

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,839
to the center of the cook ecosystem

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,360
unraveling actors roles and

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,519
relationships which is a joint war

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,280
between norton livelock and ulecom

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,039
when we connect to the internet there

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
are multiple things that we expect to

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,920
happen

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
probably the most obvious one will be to

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
obtain a lot of knowledge and

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
information right

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,760
but there are multiple things that are

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
happening in the background that many

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,439
people do not expect

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,039
being tracking one of the most important

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,920
ones so here's the question

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
do we know who is watching us online

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
and i'm sorry to say that the answer is

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
definitely no

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,559
so let's start with an example you go to

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,680
sports.com

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
and esports.com is loading one resource

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:48,960
two

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
three even four resources these

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,520
resources they can load other resources

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
that may be from sports.com

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,239
or third parties this leads to a

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,039
situation

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
where in that pace there are multiple

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
cookies that are created

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,760
answered but there is a problem we don't

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
know how these two things are connected

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,439
what we want to do in this study is to

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,320
understand the

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
cook ecosystem and in order to do this

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,960
we have to understand this step also

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
so we want to know who is the initiator

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,720
or the one that initiated any of these

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
processes

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
what are the intermediaries and finally

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
who are the people that are creating and

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
selling cookies

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
so if we start with the creation we can

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
detect that one specific resource may be

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
loaded by the page itself originally

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,479
is the one that initiated there are two

48
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,040
others

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
that were working like intermediaries

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,159
that maybe they are two different

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,119
companies

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
and finally we have one that is the one

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
creating the cookie

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,799
there is one interesting case that we

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
detected here that this was not analyzed

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,079
before that we named

57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,880
cookie ghost writing that is the concept

58
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,280
that

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
when someone is creating a cookie is not

60
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
creating the cookie

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
in the name of the domain of that script

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
or that resource but in the name of

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
someone else we will later explain how

64
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,039
they do this even with examples

65
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
then we have the cookie sharing so as

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,200
before we will understand who is the

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
initiator of this process

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
where the intermediaries and finally who

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
is the one that is sharing the cookie

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,720
so with this methodology we will analyze

71
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,599
138 million cookies

72
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
in more than 6 million pages using a

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,120
chromium-based scroller

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
but more concretely we analyze cookies

75
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
that they have enough information to

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
work as identifiers

77
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
and to better understand and

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
characterize the actors involved in the

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,239
process of creating and sharing cookies

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,040
we use the following main roles we have

81
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,080
creators

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,239
for the ones that are creating cookies

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,000
senders the ones that are sending these

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,879
cookies

85
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,319
the ones that they receive this

86
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,480
information will be receivers

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
and finally we'll have intermediaries

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
that they can be part of the creation of

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,920
sharing chains

90
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,080
so we start with the creators depending

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,319
on the type of cookies that they create

92
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,800
we can further differentiate in first

93
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
parties

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
so the main page third parties that are

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
externally loaded resources

96
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,280
that are creating cookies for themselves

97
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,840
and then

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
ghost writers so as we introduce the

99
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,879
concept of cookie ghost writing

100
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
which are the ones that are related to

101
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
cookies that are set for

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,239
a party imagine the website that user is

103
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,360
visiting at the moment

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
but are actually created by a different

105
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
entity a script loaded for an advertiser

106
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,239
for example

107
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,840
this is very common and this is

108
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,599
something that it has to be analyzed in

109
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,360
order to understand the full ecosystem

110
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,080
so if we go with an example of this so

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
there is a page

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
that has some image and video hosting

113
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,799
service

114
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,319
that loads a script from a domain

115
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,239
belonging to a company that provides

116
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
digital trust services

117
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
this script creates a cookie and in

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
reality they are not creating the cookie

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,879
in his domain

120
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
they are creating the cookie in the

121
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
image and video hosting service

122
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,640
this situation it was actually a

123
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
specific case that we found

124
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,120
in in our data set there are many other

125
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239
examples that will later also explain

126
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,840
so if we specifically analyze the

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
distribution of the cookies

128
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
that we find between the different types

129
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,959
we can see that

130
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
third-party cookies and ghosted cookies

131
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
are the most common ones

132
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
and the first party cookies are actually

133
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,000
a very small percentage

134
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
but if we analyze how how many pages are

135
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
these cookies created we can see that

136
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
the first party cookies are the ones

137
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
that there are more pages

138
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,919
and third party cookies and ghosted

139
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
cookies are actually in a similar

140
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
number of pages however websites that

141
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,400
include third party or costed cookies

142
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
typically include more of these

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
than first party ones moreover on

144
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
websites that include them

145
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
they are created by an average of around

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
three different actors

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,919
and this suggests that ghosted cookies

148
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
are used in a similar way to third-party

149
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
ones

150
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,240
now we analyze the senders here we start

151
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
with an example of

152
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
a creation change with four different

153
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
resources

154
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
and the last one is the one that is

155
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,080
creating the cookie

156
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
if this specific resource is the one

157
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
that is sending the cookie will classify

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
as own sender because he's sending his

159
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
own key

160
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
but if the one that is sending the

161
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,479
cookie in the other side is someone that

162
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,840
was in the chain of creation but it's

163
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
not the one creating the cookie will

164
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,479
classify it as

165
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,600
in change sender and then there is one

166
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
extra case

167
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
the case that some resource that was

168
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,160
literally not

169
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
related to the creation chain of the

170
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,759
cookie in this case we'll call it

171
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,039
offchain sender now if we analyze the

172
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,919
receivers

173
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,160
have other categories so the first one

174
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
will be very similar so the one that is

175
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,759
creating the cookie will be on

176
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
receiver in a similar way the one that

177
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
is in the chain of the creation is the

178
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
one receiving we'll call it engine

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
receiver

180
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
but now we have an extra category that

181
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
is insane cell receiver

182
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
that is the concept of that specific

183
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,479
indian receiver

184
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,919
is also the one that is sending the

185
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,120
cookie to himself

186
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
and as before the last case will be some

187
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
resource that it was not

188
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,319
involved in the creation of the cookie

189
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,919
is the one that is receiving so it will

190
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,919
be off chain received

191
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,639
and it's also of a receiver if he is the

192
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,160
one that is sending the cookie took

193
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,560
himself the fact that many companies own

194
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
several domains

195
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
open the doors to misleading

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
attributions so therefore to avoid

197
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,960
pollution of our results we agree the

198
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
nodes that belong to the same

199
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
organization

200
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
so for example here we have google

201
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
analytics and double click

202
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,199
there are two google related domains but

203
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
there are two different domains

204
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,600
so what we do is we join these two in a

205
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
single node that we call google

206
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
so in this case we will not incorrectly

207
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
attribute offchain receiver for example

208
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
if they are both of the same company

209
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,960
how we do this we adopt two strategies

210
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
the first one is based on three manually

211
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,000
created list

212
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
and the other one is based on an

213
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
automated best effort approach

214
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,160
we designed based on dns data internet

215
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
routing registries

216
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
and quiz records so let's give some

217
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,440
examples of the things that we are

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,639
talking about

219
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
this is a case of onsender 12 chain

220
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
receiver so the one that is creating the

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
cook is the one sending the cookie and

222
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
is sending to someone that it was not in

223
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,120
the creation chain

224
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
so we have a website that is a

225
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
a video game website that includes an

226
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,639
advertiser

227
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,560
that creates a cookie in this case

228
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
specifically a ghosted cookie so he's

229
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,680
creating the cookie the name of the

230
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
of the gaming website not in his domain

231
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,440
name

232
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
and then what he's doing is getting this

233
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
cookie that they just created

234
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
in the gaming website and sending one to

235
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,680
someone

236
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
another company that is not related

237
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
probably because there is some agreement

238
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
between the two companies to send this

239
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
information

240
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
this would be off-chain receiver because

241
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,919
they were not related in the creation

242
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
then we have odd sensor receiver in this

243
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
case we have a

244
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
video chat website that has some script

245
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,560
that is doing some user analysis

246
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
and also some advertiser this advertiser

247
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
is creating

248
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
some identifiable cookie

249
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
and the thing is that this user analysis

250
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,360
script

251
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,039
is getting this information from the

252
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,879
advertising company and sending to

253
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,840
himself

254
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,479
in this case this is why you will be

255
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
classified as a off chancel receiver is

256
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
the one that is getting the cookie

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
and is the one that is also receiving

258
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
the cookie even if he was not related in

259
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,360
the creation of that cookie because it

260
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
was only part of the advertiser

261
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
then we have insane self-receiver in

262
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,879
this case we have a news page

263
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,039
that includes some sponsored articles

264
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,560
those typical articles that you see at

265
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,800
the

266
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
bottom of the page this specific

267
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
company is the one that includes an

268
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
advertiser

269
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
and this advertiser creates a cookie so

270
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,279
the sponsor of that

271
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
company gets this cookie that he was in

272
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
the chain of the creation of the cookie

273
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
because he is the one that included the

274
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,920
advertiser

275
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,399
gets the cookie and send it to himself

276
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
probably for matching purposes

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,279
then we have intermediaries the

278
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
method that we designed here also enable

279
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
us to emphasize the role of middlemen

280
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
which are not directly involved in the

281
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
cookie related activities either

282
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
creating or sharing that are responsible

283
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
for initiating subsequent requests that

284
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
they will end up there

285
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
so we see that 62 of the creation teams

286
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
and 48 percent of the serving chains

287
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
they have at least

288
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
one advertisement so one intermediate

289
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
sorry

290
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,399
so that's it that is something that is

291
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
very common

292
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
moreover instead of analyzing for the

293
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,040
change we analyze for the websites

294
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
we see that 43 of the websites they

295
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
have at least three different

296
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
intermediates in their

297
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
cookie creation and selling chains which

298
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
is a lot

299
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
probably more than most of the people

300
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
was imagining

301
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,959
we analyze the actors and the roles

302
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,240
which are directors that are following

303
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,959
the rules

304
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,160
as we say they are creators

305
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,360
senders and receivers and intermediaries

306
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
so creators is the most common role

307
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,640
between more

308
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
most prevalent actors but there are also

309
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,079
actors that they rarely create cookies

310
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,720
but they often act as senders and

311
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
receivers

312
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,399
moreover even if these are the main

313
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,200
roles

314
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,760
they also have some roads that are

315
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,720
intermediaries

316
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
that they have they behave in many

317
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,880
companies that they have this

318
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
so they have creator plus intermediate

319
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
or sender plus intermediate

320
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,160
and different parts it's important to

321
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,399
say that here we are seeing this general

322
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
overview of these different rows but in

323
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
the paper we analyze

324
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
the top actors that are in the ecosystem

325
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:35,839
and we say

326
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
specifically which of the roles that we

327
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,839
were describing before are taking in how

328
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,880
many websites

329
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,120
which percentage of situations that they

330
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
are included on there this

331
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,440
moreover due to time constraints we are

332
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
not able to explain

333
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
many of the things that we did in the

334
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,640
paper but i i was thinking that it is

335
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,440
interesting

336
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
to at least make some comment on them

337
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,880
that are a linkage graph so we analyzed

338
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,440
uh

339
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
how the different companies and the

340
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
different roles that these companies are

341
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,800
taking

342
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
are related so some of these linkages

343
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
were not visible before because of the

344
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
methodology some of them

345
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,519
they are visible because of our

346
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
methodology which are the different

347
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
new connections that we see we can see

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that some they work as dispatchers that

349
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
are connected to many other companies

350
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,279
sending information or receiving

351
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
information for example

352
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
we also analyzed the concept of cookie

353
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,680
collisions so it's the idea that as

354
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
multiple scripts are running on the same

355
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
page or in the same

356
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,399
iframe for example they can rewrite the

357
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,040
cookies

358
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,680
from other actors and this can make

359
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,399
collisions

360
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,240
so in the paper we analyze how common is

361
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,560
this we say which are different cases on

362
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,000
examples that we found

363
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,279
in the wild and we can understand

364
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
why this is happening also we have the

365
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
idea of website categories

366
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
so we analyzed how the categories

367
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,360
of the website and also from the

368
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
trackers are related even in the linkage

369
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
graph for example

370
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,639
in order to understand which are the

371
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,279
categories that are more related

372
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
to having cookies on specific types of

373
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,079
cookies or which are the companies

374
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,480
that they are related to more other

375
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
companies based on the categories for

376
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,399
example

377
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
so thank you very much and this was the

378
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,200
presentation

379
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,760
of journey to the center of the cook

380
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,720
ecosystem

381
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
i hope you liked it i leave my email

382
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
and my website in order to allow you to

383
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,000
contact me if you have any other

384
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,040
question

once more thank you very much
