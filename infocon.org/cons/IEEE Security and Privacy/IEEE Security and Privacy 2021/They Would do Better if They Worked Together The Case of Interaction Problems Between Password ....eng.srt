00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,120
hello and welcome to this presentation

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,679
of

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,520
our paper they would do better if they

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,279
work together my name is nicolas

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,120
swearman and i will be guiding you

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,760
through

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,440
our research and what we did

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,280
so for some motivational background

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
passwords are hard to use

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,560
even if you use them securely companies

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
will likely leak them regularly

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,240
and you will have provided passwords to

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,359
many companies

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
in theory all of these passwords would

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
have to be randomly generated and secure

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,159
in practice memorizing that many

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,239
randomly generated secure passwords

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,840
is unlikely if not impossible

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
so managing secure passwords is really

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
hard in the real world

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
this has actually led to a high amount

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
of password we use across

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
multiple accounts from multiple users

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,760
and it has led to common

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
easy passwords being used by many users

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,239
across all of the internet

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,199
there are top common passwords lists so

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,800
the most common passwords

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
across the internet from multiple

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
companies for multiple years

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
and they always start with insecure

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
passwords like one two three four five

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,680
six

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,400
i think in the past this was actually

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,040
one two three four five but i guess

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
but i guess we have gotten more secure

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,119
since then

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,880
in an online survey in february 2019

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,840
most participants 69 have actually

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,439
stated that they

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
are very good at protecting their online

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,360
accounts with

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,560
59 actually believing that they are

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
safer than the average person online

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
yet 52 have stated that they reuse

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
passwords across

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
multiple accounts and 13

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
even stated that they reuse passwords

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
for all their accounts

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,799
furthermore only 24 of participants in

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,640
this survey have stated that they use a

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
password manager

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,799
so what is a password manager in theory

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
it's a solution to your problem

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,680
so managing secure passwords is hard for

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,000
you

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
you don't want to manage passwords for

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
each service that you

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,000
sign up to and so you use a password

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
manager

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
where you only have to remember one

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
password the password to your password

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
manager which could in theory be secure

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
because you will use it

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
often in order to access your other

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
passwords and then the password manager

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,480
will actually

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,840
store secure passwords for you

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
for each service that you sign up with

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
so you can have secure

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,440
and randomly generated passwords for

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
each of your account without having to

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
memorize all of them

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,319
in a even more ideal world you also get

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,440
the usability

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
benefit of the password manager being

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,440
actually able to interact with the

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
services and websites that you use

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,800
and being able to provide passwords to

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,920
those websites and

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
obtain passwords from those websites in

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
order to

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,519
make it even easier for you to sign up

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,800
on these websites

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
however in practice in order to interact

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,040
with websites or services

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,360
on desktop password managers have to

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,720
interact with your browser

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
and they usually do so via browser

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
extensions so here you can see a list of

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,959
common browser extensions

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
when you search for password managers

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560
and

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
you install the preferred password

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
manager the one that you currently use

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
and then in theory you have a plugin

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,159
that

98
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,799
scans your website and inserts itself

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,640
and its functionality into the website

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
when it detects that you need to

101
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,040
authenticate

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
and need access to your username and

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
password so here for example we have

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
keepers having inserted a little icon

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,319
into my

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,440
username and password field in order to

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
authenticate me for this service

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
however to do so the password manager

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
has to by himself

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
scan the entire website detect that it

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
is a sign up website or a login website

112
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,159
and it has to detect the username form

113
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,239
and password form and it has to manually

114
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,879
via javascript inject itself into the

115
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,920
those forms et cetera et cetera so

116
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,920
there's a lot of code behind of it

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,640
behind it and because of that it is very

118
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,599
complex

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
for less common websites that might not

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,519
be as tested and this often means that

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,320
you

122
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
that your password manager will not work

123
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
out of the box for example

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,720
we have here our internal jitsi where my

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
password manager will not detect the

126
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,320
user and password fields

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
uh that i need to log in in order to use

128
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
that jitsi

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
so for this paper we wanted to analyze

130
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
these kinds of problems what they are

131
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
why they occur and

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,080
perhaps how we can fix them

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
so we started by collecting issues from

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
github and the chrome web store

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,560
github of course being the repository

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
for open source password managers where

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
users can report issues directly to the

138
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,759
repository

139
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
and the chrome web store being the web

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,240
extension platform where you download

141
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
password managers

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,320
and can leave reviews in order to

143
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,919
report issues to the developers so

144
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,759
in total we found 1 300 reviews on the

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
chrome web store that required for

146
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
15 password managers and we found

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,120
400 issues on github and additionally we

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
found

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,520
729 support requests on chrome web store

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
support requests being an

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
additional section that a developer can

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
enable to specifically get

153
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,400
issue reports instead of just reviews

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,039
like

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,440
i like this password manager a lot or i

156
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
hated this password manager

157
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,759
three outers had to rate the usability

158
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,039
meaning how well

159
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,320
this issue even fit into the

160
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,199
kind of issues we wanted to collect the

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,000
interaction issues with websites

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
as opposed to for example the

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
aforementioned reviews of i like this

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
placement manager or similar

165
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
and these three authors also created an

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
initial code book of

167
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,160
types of issues that we found and

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,919
so we arrived at 152 relevant issues

169
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
issues that we could actually use as

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
interaction problems between websites

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
we investigated these 152 issues

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
for the exact cause so the exact

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
interaction of code that

174
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
caused the issue we categorized them

175
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
and based on our previously created code

176
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
book we created groups

177
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
that you could call types of

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
interactions that we will

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
talk about a bit later in the results

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,280
so in conclusion we got 7 categories and

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,479
39 interactions out of it so

182
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
39 problematic examples of how password

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,639
managers fail to interact with websites

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,240
we then use the interactions we

185
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,319
collected to build so called minimal

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,440
working examples

187
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
meaning a minimal amount of code an

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,360
example snippet

189
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
that is used to reproduce this

190
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,280
interaction

191
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,759
for example we have here the source code

192
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,479
of the

193
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,759
google de page for two page login so

194
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,319
google d

195
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,840
has a two page login where you enter

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
username and password on two separate

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,000
pages one after another and in the case

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,919
of their code they of course have a lot

199
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,199
of dependencies

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,039
third party links to youtube that they

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,280
implemented

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,240
and all kind of other components that

203
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
they need to use their google branding

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
and google website

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
our minimal working example on the other

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
hand uh consists of simple html with no

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,960
special

208
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,560
tags we mainly focus on the form

209
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
which simply provides a username input

210
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
and the next button to get to the second

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
step of the two-page login

212
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,080
and we also include

213
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
a short title and description for each

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
use case mainly for usability during

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,479
testing

216
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,599
for testing then we use a automated

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,440
selenium script which allows us to

218
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,360
select a password manager

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
and then automatically opens a new

220
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,120
chrome environment with

221
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
the password manager installed and our

222
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,080
list of interactions

223
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
and we can then simply click on each of

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
these links and work through the lists

225
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,720
of interaction

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
to see for each interaction how the

227
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,120
password manager interacts with it

228
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,560
and note down our results before we get

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,000
to the results

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
i want to quickly note that we have a

231
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
full replication package

232
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,759
including the website that we built for

233
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,319
testing

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,639
so the source code of all of our minimal

235
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,000
working examples

236
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and scripts that we used like the

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,919
selenium script as well as

238
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,719
a example video recording for every

239
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
interaction that we tested

240
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,519
and it's available at this url and you

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,320
can also use

242
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
this qr code in order to access the

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
replication package

244
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
let's talk about our results we tested

245
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
the 15 most downloaded password managers

246
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,040
in the chrome web store

247
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
and additionally the three browser

248
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
vendor password mergers so the chrome

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
password manager the firefox password

250
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
manager and the edge password manager

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,720
and these are our results so the red

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,519
ones mean

253
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,000
not working interactions the green ones

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
mean uh

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,120
well working interactions the yellow

256
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,760
ones mean workaround or kind of hacky

257
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
interactions and the black one means

258
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
actions that are not applicable because

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
of features that they have that work

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,160
differently

261
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
these are of course only a few of the

262
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
interactions that we tested

263
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
more are in our paper

264
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,279
so to summarize we found that

265
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,760
17 out of 39 of the interactions we

266
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,399
tested

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
were not seamless for more than

268
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,120
five passport managers so for 17 out of

269
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
39

270
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
almost half of all interactions could

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
not even be passed by

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,279
five password managers in our data set

273
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,800
we also found

274
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
use cases that no password manager could

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,800
pass so we didn't actually find a

276
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
password manager that

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
worked with all of the websites that we

278
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,200
threw at it so

279
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,519
what does this mean well it means that

280
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,200
it's hard to build a password manager

281
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
for the web

282
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,279
and why is it hard well

283
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,440
we found as we mentioned before

284
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
different categories different types of

285
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,040
issues or types of interactions

286
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
that we want to present here starting

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
with the domain matching

288
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
so the most simple example is you have

289
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,120
two domains that use the same

290
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
credentials

291
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
and the password manager now has to

292
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
decide even if it's just a sub domain

293
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,279
whether it's safe to share an account

294
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,640
for a main domain

295
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
for the same subdomain or whether it's

296
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
not safe

297
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,279
then we also found different attributes

298
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,519
of

299
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
input fields that could either be

300
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
supported or not be supported

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
for example the autocomplete attribute

302
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,399
is actually perfect for password

303
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,480
managers because it specifies what kind

304
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,519
of input field this

305
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
is what kind of input should go in there

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
there autocomplete fields for

307
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
passwords usernames etc and then there

308
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,040
are

309
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
requirements that you can specify like

310
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,079
the maximum length

311
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,000
of a field the maximum length of a

312
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
password field etc

313
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
so we tested support for those in

314
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
different interactions

315
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
we tested we had javascript interactions

316
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
that we found

317
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
like types of encryption where

318
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,160
javascript would actually grab all signs

319
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
that you input into an input field and

320
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
replace them with stars

321
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
so the password manager when scanning

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
the field would only get stars

323
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
but the password was already sent to the

324
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,760
server and dynamic input fields that

325
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
only appear when you click a certain

326
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
button for example

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,519
and we also found additional elements

328
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
so interactions where additional

329
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,560
elements were given like

330
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
pin input fields that could even consist

331
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
of multiple

332
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,200
input html tags so they would be

333
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
theoretically multiple fields to the

334
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,839
password manager

335
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
and then there were additional forms

336
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,000
like registration forms shown on the

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
same page

338
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
or additional fields like first name and

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
last name instead of simply entering a

340
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,440
username

341
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
and we also found many more that you can

342
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
find in the paper

343
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760
so since i don't want to talk too much

344
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,839
about the types of issues we found i

345
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
want to present a few more solutions

346
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,399
more of these will also be in the paper

347
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,639
so the first and most obvious one

348
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,720
i hinted at is the autocomplete

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,000
attribute with which you can

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
specify what type of field this is and

351
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
the format specifiers with which you can

352
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
already specify things like maximum

353
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
password length

354
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
and if all password managers would

355
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
support these already standardized

356
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,839
fields

357
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
then a lot of the interactions in our

358
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
sample set could already be passed

359
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,120
there's even one for one time codes so

360
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
t otp support or similar two factor

361
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,959
support is

362
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
also already there this can even be

363
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
hyper charged

364
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,839
apple recently proposed a new password

365
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,440
rules attribute

366
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,680
which you could use in order to specify

367
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
what requirements you have for a

368
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,160
password

369
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
and what for example signs you allow or

370
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
signs you don't allow

371
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,079
you can see more about that at this url

372
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,160
another solution i would like to propose

373
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,839
concerns domain matching

374
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,800
which is the issue of multiple sub

375
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
domains like

376
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,040
example.com and auth.example.com

377
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
requiring to share credentials

378
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
we currently didn't find a solution that

379
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
password managers could implement in

380
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,519
order to

381
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,200
solve this behavior and therefore

382
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,079
we proposed to introduce a new header or

383
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,480
tag

384
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,120
similar to the content security policy

385
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
or cross-origin resource sharing

386
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
where a website can specify which

387
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
other websites or which other domains

388
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,079
are allowed to

389
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,920
use the credentials that this website

390
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
provides and then a simple

391
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
head request by the password manager

392
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
could

393
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
inquire whether domain sharing between a

394
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,000
website

395
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,160
and a different website are allowed

396
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
so these will be all solutions that

397
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
represent here more solutions will be in

398
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
the paper

399
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,959
so to summarize we found 39 interactions

400
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
a lot of which were not supported by the

401
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
15 plus 3 password managers that we

402
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
tested them with

403
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,160
and we found a few solutions that could

404
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
be implemented right now and a few

405
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,560
solutions that still need to be

406
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
implemented in web standards

407
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,839
so there's quite a bit of work to do now

408
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,360
thank you very much for your time and

409
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,199
attention and

410
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
i or we will be happy to answer any

411
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
questions you might have and discuss

412
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
any remaining results that we couldn't

413
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,518
cover in this short talk
