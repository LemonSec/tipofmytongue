00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,160
currently a phd student

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
at peking university in this talk i will

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,320
introduce our paper

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,040
when lora means emr electromagnetic

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,000
power channels

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,960
can be super resilient this is a joint

00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,000
dr rytan and my phd advisor dr jin huang

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
em current channel is a classic state

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,840
exfiltration attack

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,920
where the attacker steals classified

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
data from a computer

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,400
by using a model to manipulate the emr

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,640
of

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
memory power management unit usb

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
and so on conventional cover channels

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,880
highlighted

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,600
in network traffic thus relying on a

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
compromised network interface

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,960
in contrast em carol channels exploit

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
the infiltrated computer

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440
as a radio transmitter and thus can

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,079
bypass

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,960
a variety of network security measures

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,239
such as firewalls

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
traffic monitors and even air gaps where

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,960
network interface cards

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,760
are disabled or removed to physically

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,680
isolate classified state

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
from the outside world however due to

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
the low power of emr the threat of the

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,439
existing em color channels has been

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,000
limited

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,119
to only short-range attacking scenarios

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,000
for example prior studies show that the

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,119
emr of a typical cpu memory system

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,240
can be decoded within only 5 meters

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,360
which demands the attacker to be

40
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,880
unrealistically close to the target

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
system in addition to pass loss curved

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
em signals are subject to the

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,439
attenuation

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,159
caused by shielding for example the

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
temperature standard

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,439
developed by nato and the national

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,960
security agency

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
requires classified systems to be

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,479
shielded by

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,320
minimum of 1000 decibels in comparison

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
the emr of a typical cpu memory systems

52
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
is only 15 decibels about the noise flow

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,759
in this paper we challenge the common

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
belief that em curved channels are

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,079
vulnerable to attenuations

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,719
caused by past loss and shielding in

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,600
particular

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
we asked if yam card channels can

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
survive deep continuation

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,239
thereby achieving long range or

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,040
breaching

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,760
aggressive shield previously considered

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,080
as

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,599
secure to descend we will revisit

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
em color channels with lora a

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,720
state-of-the-art

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
various technology that enables

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,160
kilometer level

69
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,200
connectivity for android styled iots

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
lora features an attenuation resistant

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,040
modulation

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,519
called chirp spread spectrum in its

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,080
chirp

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,480
signal frequency linearly increases with

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,120
time

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
leading to a pattern that can be

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,239
distinguished from

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,040
significant noise in lora different

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
beats are represented by different

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
cyclic sieves of chirps for example the

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
red figure shows four chirps

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
it's carrying two bits represented by

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,120
one of

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
four possible shifts motivated by the

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
super resilience of lora networks

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
we ask the question is it feasible to

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,239
exploit em sources as the lora radios

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,120
to fundamentally escalate em-called

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,800
channel attacks

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,440
to explore this feasibility we design

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,080
implement

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,879
and evaluate yam laura the first em carl

93
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,840
channel that can

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
exfiltrate dates over long distance and

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,159
aggressive shield

96
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,799
we conduct extensive experiments to

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,440
study the performance of yam lora

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,239
and demonstrate how yam lora enables

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,200
attacks in

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
previously impossible scenarios the key

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
idea of em lora is to exploit

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
memory as a lora radio transmitter yam

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,760
lora shares the same attack model with

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
previous em cover channels

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,920
but can significantly boost the

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,799
attenuation resilience by five orders

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,519
to achieve this yam lora faces several

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,879
unique changes

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,760
from a signal processing angle yam lora

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
must handle the complex spectrum of

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
memory emr

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
from a system angle the malware of yam

113
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
laura faces uncontrollable cpu

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,280
contentions

115
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,920
which pose a fundamental challenge for

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
precisely shipping covered signals

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,959
in the following we demonstrate how

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
attackers can circumvent these changes

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
to make yam lora visible and

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
reliable em laura's transmitter is a

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
user space model that

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,040
shifts memory mr by manipulating memory

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
rights

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,560
the code of vm lora transmitter consists

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
of two parts

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
the first part is a fixed frequency emr

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,919
generator which alternately writes to

128
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,479
ecosize the bad blocks into memory

129
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
because the two bed blocks produce

130
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,320
different current flow patterns

131
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
in memory bus the generated emr

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
approximates

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
a square wave where bad block size

134
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
determines frequency

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,680
to generate em chirps an iu method is to

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,000
call

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
square wave with linearly increasing

138
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,199
frequency

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
unfortunately the turbo energy generated

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
in this way is very low

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,479
because of cpu contention this makes yam

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
laura unable to accurately control the

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
timing of generated waves

144
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
thus introducing frequency arrows to

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
address this problem

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
em laura performs approximate chirp

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
generation

148
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
specifically it first divides a

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,720
continuous chirp into discrete frequency

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,360
levels

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
and then generates multiple square waves

152
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
at each frequency level

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,240
for a certain wheel time because square

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,880
wheels at

155
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
each frequency level are independently

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
affected by timing arrows

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840
the average of their frequencies follows

158
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
normal distribution

159
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
according to the central limit zero the

160
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,360
variance of

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
average frequencies decreases as the

162
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,919
number of square waves increases

163
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
which means that the longer the wheel

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,320
time the stronger the emr energy at

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,120
the intended frequency based on

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
empirical observation

167
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
we found that the dual time of 1.5

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
milliseconds

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
is sufficiently robust to generate

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
strong chirps

171
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
to decode the covert signal of em laura

172
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
it's important to understand

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
the spectrum characteristics of memory

174
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,440
mr

175
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,160
specifically before chirp modulation

176
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,639
memory yammer is purely produced by

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
memory clock

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
which is generated using spirit spectrum

179
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
to reduce emr intensity

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
as modeled in this equation a memory

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
clock is the sum of a series of

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,000
subclocks

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
for example the bottom figures show the

184
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,759
emr spectra

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
of ddr3 on the ddr4 agreeing with the

186
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,840
model

187
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,800
the energy of memory mr is distributed

188
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
as a series of peaks

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,840
where each peak corresponds to one

190
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
subclock

191
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
we observe that the modulation of em

192
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,599
lora introduce

193
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,240
complex features into the spectrum of

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,599
memory clock

195
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
specifically sharp energy is dispersed

196
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:58,960
as

197
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
a series of mirror images where each

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
sub-clock is associated with the

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
abstract and the dung chirp

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,639
in addition each up and down chop

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
produce a sequence of harmonic images

202
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
such energy dispersion significantly

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
reduces the

204
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
intensity of em chirps thus posing a key

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,759
challenge

206
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,039
to em laura receiver we have developed

207
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
a theoretical model to explain such

208
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,639
modulation

209

details of the model can be found in our

other processes

248
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,720
as illustrated in the figure cpu

contentions of other processes

250

lora

252
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
which interrupts the transmission of

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,480
and distorts the generated em chirps

to further understand the impacts of cpu

contention

257
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
we test the effect of different cpu laws

258
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
on the frequency and the power of em

259

260
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,760
as shown in the red figure em chirps

261
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,959
begin to suffer

262
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
distortion when cpu becomes fully loaded

263
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,200
the frequency error and power loss of

264
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
generated chirps

265
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
further increase as the cpu becomes

266
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
overload

267
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
to make yam lora survive cpu contention

268
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
we leverage the tradeoff between

269
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
throughput and

270
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
chirp robustners specifically longer

271
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
chirps carrying therapies

272
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
improve robustness but decrease

273
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
throughput

274
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,160
in comparison shorter chirps carrying

275
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
more beats degree robustness but the

276
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
increase throughput

277
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
based on this observation young laura

278
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
first estimates the level of cpu

279
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,200
contention

280
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
and adopts chirps to balance bit rate

281
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
and robustness

282
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,360
specifically it first measured the

283
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
timing error experienced by chirps

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
and then uses the timing arrow as a

285
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,480
feature to classify the level of cpu

286
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,360
contention

287
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
based on classification results em laura

288
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
switches between three predefined

289
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,240

291
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
and indicates the number of bits

292
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
carried by each chirp the red figure

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
shows a runtime example of

294
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
chirp in the beginning yam laura

295
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
transmits short chirps for higher

296
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,760
throughput

297
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
when the cpu is under load when cpu load

298
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,519
increases

299
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,839
yamlora increases turbulence to improve

300
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,440
robustness we have implemented a

301
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,920
prototype of the amorous receiver using

302
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
blade rf

303
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,160
inexpensive software radio equipped with

304
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
a 2.2 dbi

305
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
whip antenna the malware transmitter is

306
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
deployed on different systems

307
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,160
equipped with ddr3 and ddr4 of different

308
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,360
speeds we compare yam lora with cs mime

309
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,920
or state of the art memory card channel

310
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,800
for fair comparison both yam laura and

311
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
the

312
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,079
are implemented using the same blade if

313
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,880
receiver

314
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
and then compared under the same bit

315
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,480
rate we observed that

316
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
compared with the s mime m laura

317
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
improves attenuation by

318
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,160
up to 53 decibels under extends its

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,680
communication range by

320
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
up to 21 times when receiving from the

321
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
ddr3 desktop

322
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,200
yam laura achieves a range of 2000 to

323
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
2050 meters

324
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
and then resists up to 78 decibels

325
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,240
attenuation

326
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
we note that the resilience of yam lora

327
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
can be further improved

328
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
using high gain rna and directional

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
antenna

330
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,560
which typically provide an additional

331
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
gain of up to 70

332
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
decibels and thus will allow yam laura

333
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,399
to defeat the 1000 decibels bar

334
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,440
of tempest we then evaluated the

335
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
performance of

336
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
em laura under cpu contention we started

337
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,079
two types of

338
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,040
contending cpu workloads including video

339
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
streaming

340
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,320
and the monero's colon mining this

341
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
figure shows the good process of yam

342
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
lora as a function of

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
attenuation when rate adoption is on and

344
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,440
off

345
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
we observe that rate adoption

346
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
effectively maintains attenuation

347
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
resistance under cpu contention

348
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,279
specifically

349
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,240
it provides about two and five decibels

350
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
gain over the basic

351
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,200
em lora next we demonstrate how yam lora

352
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,399
enables attacks

353
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
in two previously impossible scenarios

354
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
by achieving long communication range em

355
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,880
laura enables

356
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,200
wide array data exfiltration which

357
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,920
allows an attacker to deploy a receiver

358
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,519
in a public area

359
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,760
to receive classified data export

360
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
treaties from a building

361
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,040
to demonstrate this attack we use a ddr3

362
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
laptop as em laura transmitter

363
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
and deploy it in a building with

364
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,279
concrete walls

365
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
we then place five reservoirs out of 30

366
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:56,760
and

367
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,760
1020 meters away from the building

368
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,079
we observe that all packets can be

369
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,360
correctly decoded

370
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,399
at r1 r4 and r5 due to long

371
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,680
communication distance

372
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,200
receivers at x2 and x3 experienced

373
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,480
a moderate package loss with a loss rate

374
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,399
of 11.2 percent

375
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,240
and 53.4 respectively

376
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
we further conducted retracing based

377
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
emulations in two scenarios

378
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
where we deployed em lora receivers in a

379
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
public park on the sports center

380
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
to receive covered signals leaked from

381
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,639
two government buildings located in

382
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,680
washington dc

383
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,480
and beijing in its scenario we placed

384
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
transmitters in

385
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,839
three selected locations within the

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,720
buildings

387
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,760
we found that in the dc scenario the em

388
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
laura receiver can decode most

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
packets and limit package loss rates at

390
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,440
below

391
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
20 in the beijing scenario yam laura

392
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
suffers a relatively high packet loss

393
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,440
only when receiving from ts2 at act 2

394
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
found that this is caused by the block

395
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,800
of a building

396
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
that casts off the direct pass between

397
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,000
transmitter and receiver

398
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,320
we next demonstrate through the voltage

399
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,279
at filtration

400
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,600
from an aggressively shielded server in

401
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,720
an indoor area

402
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360
the target server is deployed in room d

403
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,839
and is sorted by a commodity

404
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,639
faraday cage that provides about 70

405
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,160
decibels attenuation

406
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,959
we observe that without shielding of 30

407
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:29,600
cage

408
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,680
leak states can be received at all

409
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,959
locations except

410
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,680
a when the target server is enclosed in

411
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,240
the third

412
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,279
cage location b and i turn to dead spots

413
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,000
despite that yam lora can maintain a bit

414
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,839
rate higher than 2 bps

415
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,120
at all other locations in conclusion we

416
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
presented

417
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
yam lora the first super resilient em

418
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
card channel

419
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
em laura expressed memory as a covered

420
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,360
lora radio

421
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
it shared the same attack model with

422
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
prairie m carroll channels

423
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,839
but can significantly boost attenuation

424
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,880
resilience by

425
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
up to 53 decibels by achieving this

426
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
yam lora can enable attacks in

427
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
previously impossible scenarios

428
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,560
including wide area data exfiltration

429
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,680
and third decade

430
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,240
penetration in the future we plan to

431
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
further investigate the implication of

432
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,959
vm lora for other em sources

433
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,519
and develop effective detectors and

434
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,000
countermeasures to mitigate yam laura's
