1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
good afternoon everyone thanks for

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,830
saying for the last talked I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font>

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,319
you're here because I'm so excited to

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">share with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our work looking at SMS</font>

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,490
known to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the world as</font>

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:16,230
text messaging so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start a</font>

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,240
discussion of SMS by looking at the

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,840
message network that messages are sent

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and so if you open up a textbook</font>

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,560
and won't trying to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how text</font>

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,259
messages work you're going to see a

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,880
diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks something like this</font>

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,899
text messages originated<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a phone and</font>

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,469
are sent to a tower who then delivers

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,079
the message into a network core and so

16
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,300
when we start building systems that rely

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,219
on SMS this is the network that we think

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,589
we see we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when we send a text</font>

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">message it's going to be transmitted</font>

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,870
through a trusted secure isolated

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,110
network but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth is much more</font>

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,550
complicated and the network actually

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,899
looks something<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more like this so</font>

24
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,089
this network is vastly more open and

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,659
much more complicated than we think it

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in particular it's possible for</font>

27
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,810
computers to send text messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,900
from each other without actually ever

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,090
touching the core network now the upshot

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,180
of this is that SMS is no longer a

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,890
simple isolated channel and so when we

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">build systems that rely on text</font>

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,619
messaging things like two-factor

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,850
solutions we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using this</font>

35
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:30,930
isolated core network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've actually</font>

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a much broader attack surface and so</font>

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,970
what this work is looking at is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

38
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security implications of this in</font>

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,170
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got such a</font>

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,409
broad attack surface what are the

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,210
implications of what happens when one of

42
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,899
these entities one of these many

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,270
entities is eventually compromised and

44
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,619
so to answer this question<font color="#CCCCCC"> we collected</font>

45
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,259
a data set of over three hundred and

46
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand text messages from entities</font>

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,689
known as public gateways in 28 countries

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,210
over 14 months now a public gateway is

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,490
kind of a unique entity most of us has

50
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,380
never seen one of these but it's a

51
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,139
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it looks something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

52
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,900
at the top there's a phone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,849
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website advertises and it says</font>

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,010
send text messages to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

55
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,399
and they appear on this public website

56
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,129
and so you can kind of think of this as

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,650
kind of a proto twitter where messages

58
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,109
are sent and posted publicly and now

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,030
these websites advertise themselves as a

60
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,950
way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> message maybe when</font>

61
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,989
your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't working or when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

62
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to avoid spam or unwanted callers</font>

63
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,640
and so we collected this data and we're

64
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,298
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the uses and abuses</font>

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,040
that we find in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data so before we</font>

66
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,690
dive deeper though I want to talk just

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">briefly about some of the ethical</font>

68
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,609
considerations we addressed in

69
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,639
particular our paper features an

70
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,409
extensive ethics discussion and so if

71
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,909
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got any questions about the the</font>

72
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,189
work that we did we encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

73
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:02,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at that I'm also available</font>

74
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:06,959
offline all this week to answer and have

75
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:09,060
any discussions you might have so the

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,459
book of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sent to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gateways by</font>

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,310
institutions so we're talking about

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,040
Testament text messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent from the</font>

79
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,840
googles and Facebook's of the world the

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,790
data does of course include some

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,209
personal messages and some messages

82
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,590
containing sensitive information now for

83
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,480
the purposes of the three church it's

84
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,699
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand that this is</font>

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,798
already public data made available on

86
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,769
the web to anyone who goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font>

87
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,690
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to users that this data</font>

88
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,400
will always be public and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important</font>

89
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,349
to understand that messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive</font>

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,840
at these gateways only<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive there</font>

91
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,970
because some user at some point said

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,430
this number which actually posts

93
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:52,319
publicly I claim as my number so that's

94
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most important thing to understand</font>

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the ethics of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research is</font>

96
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot and do not attempt to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

97
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,060
anonymize track identify exploit or

98
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,870
otherwise use the personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

99
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,359
of any users<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our analyses explicitly</font>

100
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,549
exclude personal messages so what we're

101
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:13,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">really looking at this study is how</font>

102
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:15,479
institutions are using SMS so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

103
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,699
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uses</font>

104
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,090
of SMS data and that is for one-time

105
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,590
passwords and verification codes

106
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,739
commonly seen in second two-factor

107
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,460
solutions so we one of the questions

108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,270
that we had

109
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,909
was our are these systems using good

110
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,948
randomness when they send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pin and</font>

111
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,599
so to answer this<font color="#CCCCCC"> question we generated</font>

112
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,660
a heat map that looks something like

113
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this for several of our services and</font>

114
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,650
what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we divided the four</font>

115
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,539
digit<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin space into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two-dimensional</font>

116
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,000
coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> space your first two digits</font>

117
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,180
are on the vertical axis your final two

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,130
digits are along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> horizontal axis and</font>

119
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,650
the darkness<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the color indicates how</font>

120
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,110
many pins that we received of that

121
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,060
particular value and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this</font>

122
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,370
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plot from the instant messaging</font>

123
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,680
service line and as you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

124
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">pin distribution is pretty random except</font>

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,039
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they never use a leading 0 this was</font>

126
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,020
likely a usability decision that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

127
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,409
engineers made let's contrast that with

128
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,840
another service this is we chat a

129
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,860
popular instant messaging client in

130
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,198
China as you can see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't as</font>

131
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,569
random as we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to see in fact</font>

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,759
what's happening is you see this very

133
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear constellation of pins because the</font>

134
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,360
foremost lease for least significant

135
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,250
bits of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the random number generator are</font>

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,169
constant<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is a fairly common</font>

137
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem in poorly implemented random</font>

138
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,380
number generators fortunately towards

139
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,460
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our data collection they</font>

140
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,770
actually changed the random<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

141
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,138
generator and are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> better now but</font>

142
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,580
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only using 625 pins</font>

143
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,169
another service that we found is talk to

144
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is an over-the-top messaging</font>

147
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,370
can see here they are failing to use

148
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,310
over half of the over half of the pin

149
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,380
space and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure what design</font>

150
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,960
decisions led to this particular pattern

151
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:17,759
but it's obvious that it's a problem so

152
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,099
in total we looked at 33 different

153
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,690
services and we found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 fixer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs.</font>

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,830

157
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,440
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cache a previously used</font>

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,589
they send a pin and you don't receive it

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">or you don't receive it in a timely</font>

161
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:38,339
fashion they don't change the pin they

162
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,139
just resend the old one and as a result

163
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:44,090
the messages don't

164
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:47,009
ways past statistical randomness<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests</font>

165
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,469
lets you look at some other examples of

166
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,689
misuse of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS channel and in</font>

167
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,279
particular let's look at some some

168
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,219
sensitive information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's being sent</font>

169
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,960
in the clear over text messages so these

170
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,779
included things like password reset

171
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,638
links where to reset<font color="#CCCCCC"> your password all</font>

172
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,860
you have to do is receive a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font>

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,270
and click a link now this is problematic

174
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">because with this one link any user can</font>

175
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,159
who has this message can actually click

176
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,479
this link and recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the account</font>

177
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:18,449
similarly we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> usernames and</font>

178
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the clear names</font>

179
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">and addresses and worst of all credit</font>

180
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,590
card numbers being distributed over SMS

181
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:30,060
by banks now these are instances of not

182
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,008
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not only the credit card</font>

183
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,599
numbers but the expiration dates and cvv

184
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,020
codes so everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need to</font>

185
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,460
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a purchase in a single text message</font>

186
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,099
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to take away from this is</font>

187
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,638
that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these messages are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,389

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:56,758
attack service with few<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

193
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,520
guarantees so we also had some insight

194
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,060
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> other behaviors in our data</font>

195
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,349
expecially certain types of abuse so for

196
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,149
example we saw that one percent of our

197
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">messages where we were we were able to</font>

198
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:11,550
label a spam and we also identified one

ultimate takeaway is that malicious

relatively small phenomenon if you're

interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this kind of work we</font>

and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons they do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is to limit account creation for</font>

phone verified accounts

and in this work we found that many if

220
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,599
not most of our gateway users are

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,150
actively circumventing phone verified

222

accounts in fact some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the gateways</font>

messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> to numbers located in countries</font>

227
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,180

read by someone in in Iran we were able

231
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see this because we many of these</font>

things like bit ly that provide

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,610
aggregated statistics publicly that we

235
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,020
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at and I do</font>

236
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it clear that we only saw</font>

237
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:43,350
country level data with this study but

238
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,449
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is evidence that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks are</font>

239
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,930
using these gateway services as of what

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,650
means of evading<font color="#CCCCCC"> geofencing and</font>

241
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,650
implemented by phone verified accounts

242
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:59,220
another piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we found</font>

243
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that the lifetime of an account was</font>

244
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:07,020
strongly indicative of use of phone

245
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,940
phone verified account evasion so we

246
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,460
know this because when a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers is</font>

247
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">posted online we can see that there's a</font>

248
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,380
sharp spike in the message volume so

249
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,600
there's a huge number of messages

250
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,280
followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a steep drop-off because</font>

251
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,250
what's happening is individuals are

252
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,689
browsing to this website see a new what

253
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,220
phone number is<font color="#E5E5E5"> available they go and</font>

254
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">register as many accounts as they can</font>

255
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,910
with that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> until the number no</font>

256
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,230
longer works for new accounts and then

257
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,670
we see a rapid drop off in in messages

258
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,050
delivered to that particular phone

259
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,400
number so understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a</font>

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,160
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's being facilitated by</font>

261
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,689
these gateways we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is</font>

262
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,350
there anything that we could do to

263
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,430
prevent phone verified accounts and so

264
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,050
trying our best to be good researchers

265
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,689
we went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the literature and</font>

266
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,089
found that there had<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a prior study</font>

267
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,710
looking at phone verified accounts that

268
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,130
made several recommendations on ways to

269
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,510
stop this practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so in the</font>

270
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,550
particular that work that appeared at

271
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">ccs two years ago suggested three</font>

272
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,979
defenses the first of these

273
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,320
was to have users re verify often so

274
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,270
instead of giving a phone number once

275
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,160
and then having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pin code at</font>

276
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,550
that number once have them do it say

277
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,319
every day or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two the thinking being that</font>

278
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,050
phone numbers are expensive and you pay

279
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,020
perhaps by the day and so this would

280
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,599
greatly increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost to the</font>

281
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,400
attacker but what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found was that in</font>

282
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,400
our data set our numbers had a lifetime

283
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 days as the median some</font>

284
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,400
lasted over a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what that</font>

285
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,560
means is that on average your fraudsters

286
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,939
going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afford at least 20</font>

287
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,140
days of fraud with his new account

288
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,550
before needing to shut them down the

289
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,819
second suggestion was to block numbers

290
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:56,880

291
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,940
being that number numbers that are

292
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,470
provided by brand name telcos your

293
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">t-mobile's and vodafone's of the world</font>

294
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,960
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be different from maybe a</font>

295
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,089
fly-by-night VoIP carrier but what we

296
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">found was that most of our gateway</font>

297
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:15,089
numbers are in common reputable carriers

298
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,000
and so what that means is that blocking

299
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:22,110
reputation is unlikely to be a very

300
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,150
successful strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term the third</font>

301
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,490
suggestion was blocking similar numbers

302
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,560
so the thinking being that if I am a

303
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,230
fraudster and I need to acquire a large

304
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,689
number of phone numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to buy</font>

305
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,080
them in blocks with numbers the numbers

306
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,690
are similar and therefore as a

307
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,150
institution<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I am trying to block</font>

308
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,279
this fraud I can take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a known</font>

309
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,319
bad number and block numbers that are

310
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,240
similar but what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that forty</font>

311
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,950
percent of our numbers were similar but

312
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,170
only in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most reputable mobile</font>

313
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,600
carriers meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you were to try</font>

314
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,849
to use a number similarity as a metric

315
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,680
you'd be likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to suffer a high false</font>

316

<font color="#CCCCCC">positive rate because that's where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

most legitimate users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

318
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:07,020
and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> takeaway from this is that</font>

319
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,300
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified account evasion is still</font>

320
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,260
very much an open problem and it's going

321
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be hard to detect or prevent so I</font>

322
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,089
have three main takeaways from this

323
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,620
paper the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that online</font>

324
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,329
gateways like these can give us insight

325
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">into how text messages are</font>

326
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:25,378
used and abused in this modern AQ SMS

327
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:27,569
ecosystem the second is that

328
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations regularly use text</font>

329
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,618
messages as a secure channel for

330
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,238
sensitive information despite the fact

331
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:36,329
that there are limited guarantees and

332
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:38,160
high risks of compromise and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

333
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,799
takeaway is that gateway data provides

334
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,410
insights into spam phishing and phone

335
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,489
verified account fraud and so with that

336
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,738
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to thank you for your attention</font>

now<font color="#E5E5E5"> please yes what makes you think that</font>

339
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:03,899
the carriers that are the institutions

340
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,488
that are sending messages you sorted

341
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,379

350

351
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:31,610
are the same banks are<font color="#CCCCCC"> still sending</font>
