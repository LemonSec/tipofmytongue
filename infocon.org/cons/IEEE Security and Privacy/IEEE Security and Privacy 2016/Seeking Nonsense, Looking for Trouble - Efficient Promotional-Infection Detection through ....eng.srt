when you listed all of the topics you

296
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,950
were fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> like travel and everything</font>

297
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,780
else politics is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last one how</font>

298
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,130
did you catch the semantic terms and

299
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,220
what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you getting is it to</font>

300
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:54,130
basement or something else sorry I did

301
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,290
not go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to office but it was parked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

302
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,910
so when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that political query</font>

303
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,439
and you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the semantic search you</font>

304
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,600
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> for casinos and you expand it</font>

305
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,890
out how did you basically make that leap

306
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,900
erm something that's traditional like

307
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:09,430
SEO monetization<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something that</font>

308
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:13,810
politically focused we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantics</font>

309
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> law stld from the wikipedia page what</font>

310
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,959
embedding fundamentally was the what

311
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:22,959
embedding is to cut a vector 21 words to

312
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,750
other words to get this vector and the

313
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,930
other words we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot of us is</font>

314
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,110
being led we got from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wikipedia page</font>

315
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,599
such as for example when you're talking

316
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,240
about education the wiki page may also

317
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,800
talk talking about graduations so that

318
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:45,430
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> solely we'll have each values on</font>

319
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,339
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> own distance and which had with</font>

320
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,260
generator vectors and for the content

321
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was actually injected was it like</font>

322
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,270
defacement or was it something else

323
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,560
sorry well the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was jected</font>

324
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,270

325
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,459
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple others liked was that</font>

326
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,990
like politically motivated basement or

327
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:08,319
was it some sort of monetization keep

328
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:11,680
going on there is so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a popular</font>
