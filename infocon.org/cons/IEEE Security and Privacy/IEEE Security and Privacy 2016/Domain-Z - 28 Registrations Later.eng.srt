1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get started I want to talk a</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit what i mean by when I say</font>

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,230
residual trust it's a very simple

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept it's simply the historical</font>

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,590
reputation of a domain that's implicitly

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,690
transferred with a change in ownership

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,940
and this residual trust can be either

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,439
positive or negative depending on

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,050
whether the historical reputation of

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,550
that domain was good or bad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font>

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,460
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number it's kind of a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">different security concerns that result</font>

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,760
because of this so let's look at a

14
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,500
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of those I'll start out</font>

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,750
with an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an expired name</font>

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,219
server domain so in this case there was

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,290
an educational institution<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

18
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,969
benedictine university they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

19
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party domain for one of their</font>

20
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,200
secondary name servers at some point

21
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain was actually allowed to</font>

22
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,030
expire so what's the big deal here well

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,670
that domain was subsequently

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,190
reregistered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> an SEO company that</font>

25
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,020
wild-card the MX record so this meant

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,250
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email at all the emails</font>

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were sent to addresses that that</font>

28
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,379
domain were getting sent to this SEO

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,239
company and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is particularly</font>

30
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,890
problematic given that some of these

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,709
email addresses were for students and

32
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,920
for students<font color="#E5E5E5"> are protected by certain</font>

33
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,360
privacy laws like FERPA an even more

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,650
challenging aspect of this was this was

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,900
a particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult problem to</font>

36
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,000
diagnose because of the secondary name

37
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,439
server so this meant that the emails

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,150
were only getting forwarded to this SEO

39
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,059
company intermittently it wasn't

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,340
constantly happening so clearly that's

41
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,030
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing but it actually gets</font>

42
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,100
worse so we also see a case where we

43
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,530
looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses used as</font>

44
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,809
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contact information for</font>

45
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,250
regional internet registries and these

46
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,200
email addresses were actually being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

47
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,119
as trust anchors and what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being used to verify that</font>

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,860
you were who you were so you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

50
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the login portal and administer the</font>

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">siders that you had control of so we</font>

52
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there were hundreds</font>

53
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,720
of these email addresses that were under

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,040
expired domain names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these were</font>

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,829
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for immediate reregistration</font>

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,649
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meant was that anyone could</font>

57
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,719
go and buy one of these domains say it

58
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,399
stand up their own mail server go to the

59
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,860
login portal and request a password

60
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,869
reset this meant you could log into the

61
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,580
the portal with your new credentials and

62
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,620
now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make unauthorized changes</font>

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,010
to IP allocations clearly this isn't

64
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,409
something

65
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,500
you want happening on the internet but

66
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all we also evaluated another</font>

67
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,760
case where we looked at approximately

68
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,010
forty one thousand plugins from the

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,359
Mozilla store and when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed these</font>

70
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,379
plugins we saw that they they reached

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,209
out to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,000 unique domains for</font>

72
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,069
all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different plugins and about</font>

73
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,409
five percent of those domains were

74
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,988
actually expired so again we have

75
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,920
another problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here where the we had a</font>

76
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,049
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> where anyone could go and</font>

77
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,548
reregister one of these domains and some

78
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,590
of these plugins had tens of thousands

79
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,409
of installs and after registering this

80
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,879
they could use that domain to request a

81
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,280
password reset on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a developer account</font>

82
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,159
and now push down their own updates to

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,659
end-user browsers so in essence you kind

84
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,849
of got a browser botnet for the price of

85
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,069
a domain but that's it doesn't just

86
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:04,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">affect user level software we've seen</font>

87
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,869
the case where it affects actually

88
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,608
repositories used by operating systems

89
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,980
for updates so there was a popular

90
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,560
third-party repository called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debbie and</font>

91
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,810
multimedia org that was used for

92
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,310
obtaining multimedia applications that

93
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,730
were outside the license that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Debian</font>

94
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,870
wanted to offer and / the requests the

95
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">Debian maintainers they wanted more</font>

96
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,930
separation between so it didn't look

97
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,430
like they were endorsing this this

98
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,049
third-party repository so the acid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

99
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed the name so they registered a</font>

100
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,459
new domain called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deb multi-beam org and</font>

101
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:35,160
let the old domain expire well that old

102
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,530
domain was subsequently there was

103
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,090
unknown to the Debian community so again

104
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,560
what's the problem here well the

105
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,319
purchaser could have used that domain

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,269
and stood up their own repository<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

107
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,458
push down update for system packages

108
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,169
including the kernel or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> base system</font>

109
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,609
software and while it's true that there

110
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,819
are protections in place like key

111
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,620
signing to protect against unauthorized

112
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,629
repositories from pushing updates to the

113
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">system it's still possible for that new</font>

114
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,260
owner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain to go to the</font>

115
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet archive stand up the old page</font>

116
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,190
exactly as it was and update<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keys so</font>

117
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,918
any about any new users going from

118
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">how-to tutorials or other references on</font>

119
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:15,239
the wet to that website would just use

120
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,889
this new malicious repository so we've

121
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,030
looked at a couple examples of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

122
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,130
the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of problems that</font>

123
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:24,510
this residual trust can cause when it's

124
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,070
abused oh but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> other question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

125
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,909
remains is you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> big of a problem</font>

126
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,580
actually is

127
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,920
so we performed a long-term study over

128
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">six years where we tried to analyze just</font>

129
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,540
that and we use three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

130
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets the first is a data set of expired</font>

131
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,330
domains this was collected since 2008

132
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,159
all the way up through 2015 and it

133
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,109
contained approximately 180 million

134
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,010
expired domain names over that period of

135
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:52,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so the next data set we use we used</font>

136
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,150
a malware domain data set and this had a

137
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,430
number of domains that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used</font>

138
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">by malware at some point in time and</font>

139
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,420
this was collected since early two

140
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,570
thousand nine through July 2015 and we

141
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,520
saw about 6.1 unique 6.1 million unique

142
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,640
domained in this data set and these were

143
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,549
domains that were likely being abused

144
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data set is a more human</font>

145
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,880
curated list of domains that are likely

main data set and we collected this

148
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:23,370
since 2009 up through mid-2015 and this

149

unique domains so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the table that</font>

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows the relationship between these</font>

152
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">different data sets and we discussed</font>

153
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">this these relationships more in the</font>

154
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,680
paper so i'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

155
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,630
the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this table but what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">will look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is i want to call attention</font>

157
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,210
to a couple different numbers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

158
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,610
table the first is this we this is the

159
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">intersection between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the expired domains</font>

160
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,230
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mauer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domains so these are</font>

161
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,720
domains that could likely be considered

162
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,120
candidates for residual trust of use and

163
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,400
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we saw that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there were about</font>

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,169
300,000 of these domains in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> data set</font>

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,060
here this was about five percent of all

166
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">mauer domains were expired at some point</font>

167
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,710
in time additionally when we looked at

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the intersection between the black lists</font>

169
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,820
and the expired domain list we saw that

170
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,240
there were about a hundred thousand

171
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,880
unique expired domains in this data set

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,590
and that this was about almost a third

173
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,409
of all public blacklist domains had

174
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,849
expired at some point in time so some of

175
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,160
you might be asking or saying well this

176
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,260
raises another question when did the

177
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,840
abuse happen did it happen before<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

178
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,849
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expiration if they were abused</font>

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,500
before the expiration this likely wasn't

180
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">a case where they were abusing any trust</font>

181
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,610
in the domain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they were abused</font>

182
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,260
after expiration this means that there

183
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,760
was some residual trust associated with

184
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,920
that domain name that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were likely</font>

185
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,560
abusing and what we saw was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

186
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,560
there were about two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty three</font>

187
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,580
thousand unique total abusive domains

188
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,590
for blacklist and the the Mauer data set

189
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,640
and this meant that almost ninety

190
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,109
percent of the domains that were being

191
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,419
contacted by malware that it expired

192
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,190
were only contacted after the domain

193
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,650
expired so these were likely candidates

194
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to of residual trusted views similarly</font>

195
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,020
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten percent of the blacklist</font>

196
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain expired were abuse only after</font>

197
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,200
expiration so again these are other

198
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,550
likely candidate for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that residual trust</font>

199
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">abuse so another question is is this a</font>

200
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,540
we saw that there were a fair number of

201
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,450
domains that were being abused but it's

202
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,840
just a growing problem so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

203
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,190
highlight one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about this this a</font>

204
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,590
particular figure and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

205
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,570
only shows domains that were abused

206
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,369
after expiration so any domains here

207
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,230
were abused only after expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

208
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,150
why they're above<font color="#CCCCCC"> the diagonal on the</font>

209
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">left hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side here I want to highlight</font>

210
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,289
that this is showing domains that were

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,050
contacted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mauer only after expiration</font>

212
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,370
that had higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexa ranks so what we</font>

213
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,110
observed is that there appear to be

214
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,330
domains that are even<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly popular</font>

215
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,820
that expire and that subsequently might

216
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,520
be registered by Mauer and being

217
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,740
contacted for abuse and on the left hand

218
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,010
side these are the domains with lower

219
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,500
lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexa ranks that were contacted by</font>

220
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,330
malware after expiration for abuse and

221
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,220
what you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice here is that as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

222
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,570
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> up towards the top right you'll</font>

223
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,340
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the plot is getting a</font>

224
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,800
little bit denser and when this happens

225
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,810
what we're seeing here is that there

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,610
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more expirations there are</font>

227
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,040
more domains being abused after

228
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,480
expiration in more<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent memory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

229
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,700
is a trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seemed to be growing in</font>

230
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,760
fact to highlight this in numbers we saw

231
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that between 2009 and 2012 there were</font>

232
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,440
only about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6,000 domains that were</font>

233
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,640
abused after expiration but this doubled

234
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,500
in 2013 alone to 12,000 so you might be

235
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying well okay this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mauer these are</font>

236
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,479
this is am our data set<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mauer doesn't</font>

237
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,130
always contact a malicious domain some

238
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,730
of these might be denied domains that

239
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">mauers contacting and that's what we're</font>

240
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,260
seeing here so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually looked at</font>

241
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">this same graph but for the public</font>

242
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,950
blacklist domain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the public</font>

243
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,949
blacklist are human curated list so

244
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,050
these are less

245
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,940
like you to have the benign domains that

246
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,740
are seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the the Mauer data set and</font>

247
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you'll notice is you see a same the</font>

248
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,530
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of trend here we see this</font>

249
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:09,280
growth and again in numbers between 2009

250
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,720
at 2012 we saw 800 expired domains in

251
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blacklist that we're then used for</font>

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,230
abuse that number jumped to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9,000 in</font>

253
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,190
2014 alone large increase this seems to

254
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a problem that people are</font>

255
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,830
increasingly exploiting so how do we

256
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">even go about finding some of these</font>

257
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes well we can look for expiration</font>

258
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,150
but that's not the only way that a

259
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,500
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> can change ownership so we</font>

260
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually put the lightweight algorithm</font>

261
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">call the limbic and this light week</font>

262
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm is helps identify potential</font>

263
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,900
ownership changes using only<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and one</font>

264
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,970
of the one thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep a note about</font>

265
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this algorithm is it's not a fully</font>

266
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,280
automated detector so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps locate</font>

267
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,370
these events but it's not a a classifier

268
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,170
or anything of that nature and again I

269
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,880
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight it only relies on DNS</font>

270
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,650
components to compute a change of

271
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,680
ownership score which is how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> rank</font>

272
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,180
likely ownership change events and it

273
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,560
does not rely at all on who is

274
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,170
information so some of you might ask

275
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,199
well why not why not who is who's used

276
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to is here who's tried to collect who is</font>

277
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,520
at scale who hates your life because you

278
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,470
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect who is it scale exactly</font>

279
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,090
yeah so who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an awful thing to try</font>

280
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,590
to collect a scale different registrar's

281
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,060
have different policies about how many

282
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">queries you can collect at any given</font>

283
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,329
time who is can lie and it can lie in

284
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,590
unexpected ways and you know once you've

285
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,200
collected it it can be challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

286
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:36,610
parse so we avoid all that with Olympic

287
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,860
so how does Olympic work well we have we

288
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,960
use a window and within that window we

289
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,870
compute several different components one

290
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,970
is we look for infrastructure changes

291
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,040
around a given point in time so we

292
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,620
measure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes in the host that a</font>

293
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,020
domain points to between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the within this</font>

294
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,090
temporal window so if we see big changes

295
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,890
in infrastructure this it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicate</font>

296
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,570
they move to a different hosts or it

297
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,490
could that indicate that there was an

298
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,320
ownership change here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this isn't</font>

299
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,810
that by itself this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a good enough</font>

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,850
indicator for a change of ownership but

301
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,779
that's why we use also<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for things</font>

302
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,399
like a look at

303
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,050
volume distribution changes which might

304
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,819
indicate that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service that is</font>

305
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,680
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that domain has changed</font>

306
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:16,060
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time or you know something has</font>

307
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,160
changed about the domain may be

308
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,569
indicating an ownership change and then

309
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,819
lastly we look at start of authority

310
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,870
records and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are particularly</font>

311
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:24,639
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are records</font>

312
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,350
that don't often change so when you see

313
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,569
a change to a start of authority record

314
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,249
this often is a very good strong

315
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:35,170
indicator that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a change of ownership has</font>

316
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:37,269
actually occurred so so how effective is

317
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,559
our Olympic algorithm well one of the

318
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,199
challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we faced was the</font>

319
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,639
sparsity of passive DNS data so due to

320
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,829
this we didn't always have an

321
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,600
observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately near an</font>

322
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,219
ownership change event so one of the

323
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,870
questions you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask so this so</font>

324
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,139
you'll notice here is that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

325
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,749
about 75% of the main field within<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

326
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,879
days so this means that if if we have if

327
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:59,079
we flag domain as likely being a

328
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,120
candidate for ownership within 10 days

329
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,529
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it actually expired our</font>

330
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,559
algorithm was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good give</font>

331
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:08,230
them the sparsity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pasadena's data so</font>

332
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,420
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is our algorithm generate</font>

333
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,600
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we see here on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand</font>

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">side is that below the red line these</font>

335
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,500
are these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cases where we indicated</font>

336
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,628
that a domain was likely a light had

337
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,089
likely changed ownership given a higher

338
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:24,850
score indicating a likely ownership

339
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:27,220
change and will notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the majority</font>

340
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lighter blue dots are below the</font>

342
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,759
expect to see we also see here that as

343
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,309
the window size increases we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

344
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">at making these these identifying these</font>

345
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,309
likely ownership changes and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

346
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,949
really good and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

347
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:43,149
lightweight algorithm so using our

348
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,309
algorithm we actually made a number of

349
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">different discoveries so some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

350
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:49,000
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we found were just simple</font>

351
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,410
domains where they were abusing the

352
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,550
positive residual trust so these were

353
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,990
just whitewashed domains they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

354
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,000
previously benign domains that

355
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,679
subsequently registered by<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware and</font>

356
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,709
now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> being abused and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we verified</font>

357
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">these manually but another interesting</font>

358
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,729
cases we've talked a lot about abusing

359
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:05,139
positive residual trust but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

360
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,309
case that we mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier on was</font>

361
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:08,110
that there's also negative residual

362
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:11,709
trust so one of the domains that our

363
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,199
algorithm turned up was a an expired apt

364
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,059
domain so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is particularly</font>

365
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because these can be hard to</font>

366
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">find but this domain particular domain</font>

367
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,400
was available for<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediate registration</font>

368
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,810
so we actually registered it and started

369
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,730
selecting traffic from this domain and

370
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">we started immediately getting requests</font>

371
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,590
from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Taiwanese research Taiwanese</font>

372
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,060
research facility so what we saw here

373
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,130
was that for the low price of a domain

374
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:38,469
registration you could buy your own apt

375
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,720
pretty cool so just want to summarize

376
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,780
kind of what we've talked about briefly

377
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,790
here first is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we identified this</font>

378
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,680
idea of residual trust and we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

379
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,780
it causes a number of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

380
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,520
that sometimes seem like they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

381
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,550
caused by different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but it's the</font>

382
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,860
underlying causes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of residual trust next</font>

383
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,689
was we looked at a long-term<font color="#E5E5E5"> study of</font>

384
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,660
expired domain abuse dating back to two

385
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,580
thousand eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we observed not only</font>

386
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this residual trust abuse does</font>

387
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,190
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur but that it actually</font>

388
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,959
seems to be on the rise and then last we

389
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,790
proposed a lightweight algorithm to help

390
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,970
us identify these potential ownership

391
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,890
changes using only<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS this meant we got</font>

392
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,690
to avoid using who is which we said can

393
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,510
lie and has a number of difficulties and

394
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,800
the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually fairly good and</font>

395
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing that these results kind</font>

396
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,400
of indicate is that there might be we

397
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,290
might need better policies to help

398
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">address this problem at the you know</font>

399
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,800
registrar registry level and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

400
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other considerations beyond just</font>

401
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,660
technical solutions that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

402
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">aware of and so with that I'll open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

403
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,900
for questions

404
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,579
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> John spring new seal so I know you're</font>

405
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to tell us what blacklist you</font>

406
00:14:54,579 --> 00:15:01,059
use but I know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our other work that</font>

407
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:03,489
there are a bunch more domains on<font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

408
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists than 300,000 so I assume you a</font>

00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:09,309
couple how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that the</font>

410
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,169

411
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:13,029
curated your blacklist getting good at

412
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:17,619
detecting something that's correlated

413
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:21,549
with trust abuse rather than trust abuse

414
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually increasing so i think it's i</font>

415
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:25,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one of the indicators there is</font>

416
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,399
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just seeing this with the</font>

417
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,499
blacklist right we had two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

418
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,389
cases we had malware and we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

419
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:33,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists so either they're both happening</font>

420
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,779
by chance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be growing or</font>

421
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,879
there seems to be this this concerted

422
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,229
effort by you know people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

423
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,910
with boost to take this residual trust

424
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,919
and abuse it and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why</font>

425
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,660
that seems attractive is that if you

426
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at you know how reputation systems</font>

427
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,259
might work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a domain unless that</font>

428
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,269
domain is retired from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation</font>

429
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,739
system or something changes then you

430
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:53,769
know to picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up one of these old</font>

431
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:55,749
domains has the benefit that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,569
evade existing whitelist or blacklist

433
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,829
solutions until they remove that off we

434
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,649
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an interesting case where</font>

the we talked to people at<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook and</font>

436
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,970
they mentioned that they've had cases

437
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,859
where they have things on black or on

438
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,749
one of their spam lists and their spam

439
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:12,339
lists only get updated so often but

440
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:14,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not great at retiring things off</font>

441
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,850
the spam lists so they have cases where

442
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,498
people will complain that they're being

443
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,999
censored when really they just bought a

444
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:20,230
domain that was previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for spam</font>

445
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:22,059
and the spam list hasn't been updated

446
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,439
the same would apply for you know

447
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,689
blacklist and other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like or you</font>

448
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:28,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">know for Mauer domain so if they haven't</font>

449
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:30,129
removed from like a whitelist then you

450
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,539
know if I bought one I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skirt</font>

451
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:35,470
detection just because they look for it

452
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,699
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whitelist alright cool thanks to</font>

453
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,759
dimitra's from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of</font>

454
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:41,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">Maryland very interesting work I'm just</font>

455
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious when you say to the Malheur</font>

456
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:46,299
contacted these domains what was the

457
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:48,459
purpose was it a CNC was it a drop

458
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,689
malware what what what was he doing I

459
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,638
mean it could have been any of those

460
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,529
types of purposes<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we had we</font>

461
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,339
collected these domains from dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ram</font>

462
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,060
our dynamic execution traces so we don't

463
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially</font>

464
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,099
so many domains it's hard to know

465
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,660
exactly what all of them are used for so

466
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,829
but what we were what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting here</font>

467
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,030
is when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the intersection we</font>

468
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,919
saw that a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them were actually</font>

469
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,260
just making queries to expire domain so

470
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,880
they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something there and you</font>

471
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,670
know since them since it is malware

472
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,010
there's potential for abuse there so why

473
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,300
are so many malware samples contacting

474
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,260
domains that are expired and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

475
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,510
that's kind of the interesting thing

476
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,010
there and we saw and I think that you

477
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,690
know alone that's that's something but

478
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,129
with the blacklist that kind of helps

479
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,260
indicate that you know these are

480
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,410
hand-cured into indications of abuse so

481
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:37,870
it seems like there's something there

482
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:39,160
cool thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we have time</font>

483
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:46,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">for some more question is there any</font>

484
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:49,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">other questions okay that's nice if we</font>

485
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,280
have done so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was also curious how easy</font>

486
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,510
do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think your Olympic algorithm</font>

487
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,160
would be to evade so big so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

488
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good question so one of the things</font>

489
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,340
that's nice about the Olympic algorithm

490
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,230
right now is we're using infrastructure

491
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,540
properties of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know on the internet</font>

492
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,030
so these are things that unless you make

493
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,230
a concerted effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change this it in</font>

494
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,600
some cases it might even be hard you

495
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,010
know given the infrastructure we see

496
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,949
that now are often uses similar

497
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,300
infrastructure so some of these like

498
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if the infrastructure changes in</font>

499
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,389
the SOA records these are things that

500
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,409
aren't frequently changed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they if</font>

501
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,380
they mess with that you could possibly

502
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">evade it but we've it's since it's</font>

503
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,020
something that's infrastructure-related

504
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,020
it's it's probably more challenging
