1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,020
first I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sort of just hand</font>

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,230
over to Joe bono here who was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell us about the student pc so Joe did</font>

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,369
a fantastic job as student PC chair and

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:31,740
I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him a lot for that</font>

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:34,050
so why don't we give him a hand and at

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time as sort of incoming senior</font>

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,500
chair I'd like to appeal especially to

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,010
maybe more senior members of the

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,320
community that might be willing to be

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,110
student PC chair again as you'll see in

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,570
the in the data as successful experiment

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,809
and we need now a new Joe can't impose

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,170
on him to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so anybody who</font>

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,820
is willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer or have</font>

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,340
suggestions for people who might do a

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,539
good job please contact me directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">go ahead job so okay thanks so not going</font>

19
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go over the general</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outline of</font>

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,259
everything that we did it was about a

21
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,210
two month process but basically it was

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,979
we tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it exactly like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,070
senior pc as much as possible we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

24
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,810
same same workload per student same kind

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,509
of deadlines that we tried to make it as

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,280
close as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could so i think the most</font>

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting things to gauge how</font>

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,030
successful this was first<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll show you</font>

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,549
some statistics about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> students</font>

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,900
actually did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level observation</font>

31
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,939
was that the students managed to

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,340
reinvent almost all of the phenomena

33
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,770
that you see in senior pcs including the

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,909
things that everybody complains about

35
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,740
they complained about people being

36
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,299
unprepared and droning on in meetings

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,789
and everything else that you you know

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,390
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> love and they also gave very very</font>

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,920
similar scores so looking at the the

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,229
distribution of scores you can see it's

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,299
very very close and this was with sort

42
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of very minimal guided guidance students</font>

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knew what the meaning</font>

44
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,729
of all these scores were at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least we're</font>

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,489
handing them out about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same as the</font>

46
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,860
senior pc the only very small difference

47
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,230
that you see here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it looks like</font>

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,610
senior pc members given you know a paper

49
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,040
that was on the borderline were more

50
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,200
likely to push it to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> to here which</font>

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,328
would be a week reject and the students

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,720
gave those papers on the borderline

53
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,610
slightly more the benefit

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,710
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> downlow wasn't a significant</font>

55
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:34,920
difference so who knows there how does

56
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:37,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">this advance it the greenery right</font>

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,239
students did express lower expertise for

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,320
papers we weren't totally sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it makes sense</font>

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,019
in retrospect students felt a little bit

61
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:50,070
less confident they're in their reviews

62
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:53,760
the really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting question though</font>

63
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,709
how did the how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results compared</font>

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,510
so the students actually chose their own

65
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,750
program completely independently it

66
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,390
happened weeks before the senior<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC and</font>

67
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,030
they accepted this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is amazing how close</font>

68
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,559
these numbers ended up being without you

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,870
know on either end any real guidance

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,730
about quotas or cut-offs the students

71
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,160
accepted about as many papers as the

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">sooner the senior PC did and again this</font>

73
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,640
is that the same process they sat in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

74
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,330
room and argued and decided what was

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,920
above and below the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar however the real</font>

76
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,170
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is did they accept the same</font>

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,790
papers they accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 peso of the</font>

78
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,799
papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were in both piles there</font>

79
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,489
were about 180 papers that both the

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,510
senior PC and the student PC reviewed

81
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,850
there were nine papers that were

82
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,250
accepted both by both<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCs and then they</font>

83
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:45,220
were about 20 or 19 papers that were

84
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:49,840
accepted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by one but not the other so</font>

85
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,400
pretty big<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference there although we</font>

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
can at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least establish statistical</font>

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,450
significance that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not completely</font>

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,620
random the results between the two pcs

89
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:02,859
but it wasn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't too far off so</font>

90
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,530
you know on one sense this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe kind</font>

91
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,850
of says that the performance wasn't

92
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,310
great that they picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> largely a</font>

93
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,459
different set of papers but you know

94
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,190
having SAT through both PC meetings a

95
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,540
lot of the papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got accepted by</font>

96
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,850
one or not the other I mean there were

97
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,910
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> real reasons for it so it made</font>

98
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,310
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

99
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,110
the it seemed a lot more impressive

100
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,000
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing it then that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> N</font>

101
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,229
numbers that it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,640
results differed a lot but the I think

103
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> groups actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made very</font>

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,789
defensible decisions

105
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,530
the other thing people really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

106
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:44,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how is the inter review or</font>

107
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:48,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">agreement so it at first glance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

108
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:50,599
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know fairly good for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both groups so</font>

109
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:51,949
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> two random reviewers within the</font>

110
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:54,378
pool of students within the pool of

111
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:56,060
senior PC members or across groups a

112
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:59,300
little more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

113
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:04,370
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would assign the same score if you</font>

114
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,860
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I guess we lost something the</font>

115
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,719
if you control for the fact that you

116
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,370
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that reviewers will agree by chance</font>

117
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:12,979
a lot of the time the correlation is

118
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,629
really really low the honest you know

119
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,270
the correlation coefficient scaled

120
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,909
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one it's about point</font>

121
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,080
one both for the senior bc and for the

122
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:25,550
student pc so the good news is that

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,900
these students largely agreed and

124
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,759
actually giving out scores with the

125
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,409
senior<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc although they you know</font>

126
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,050
disagreed in the final decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font>

127
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:34,969
bit the bad news is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> groups had</font>

128
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,099
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low agreement between</font>

129
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:38,629
reviewers<font color="#E5E5E5"> although maybe that's healthy</font>

130
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:41,449
we got different opinions and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

131
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,279
people had different perspectives the

132
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,779
most positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing though which in</font>

133
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,969
encouraging you know hopefully we'll

134
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:48,229
have some folks interested in sharing

135
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:52,819
this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and repeating the</font>

136
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:55,400
experiment students really really

137
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,949
enjoyed the experience we surveyed them

138
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,448
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end and they strongly said that</font>

139
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,699
it was worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time it helped them</font>

140
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,009
understand how pcs work that bottom line

141
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,870
was supposed to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

142
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,969
do it again to recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone else</font>

143
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,159
in their group to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so hopefully</font>

144
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:12,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">this will become tradition students</font>

145
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,759
having seen it said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would go</font>

146
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,259
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their research groups and tell</font>

147
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,909
the more junior students that this is

148
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,169
worth their time worth doing it was a

149
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,759
great way to learn some things that

150
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">really couldn't be learned just by</font>

151
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,750
reading papers about how pcs work but

152
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,860
actually being<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a meeting room and</font>

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,520
doing it made a difference for the

154
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,840
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's pretty much it should</font>

155
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,210
we pause if anybody has<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions</font>

156
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:39,219
about this yeah any questions about the

157
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:39,219
student<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay look like</font>

158
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,400
so so you guys actually you had a bunch

159
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,169
of offline reviewing and then you

160
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,599
actually had them come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and meet in a</font>

161
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,490
room and debate yeah we had a we had an

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,500
in-person student pc meeting with four

163
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,630
to forty members and it was you know

164
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">just just up the road at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google so we</font>

165
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,990
did you know the full experience it was

166
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,669
we were in a room for a day people had

167
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,130
to argue they had to get tired at the

168
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:09,560
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it yeah um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

169
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,320
your slides gonna be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,910
this yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna compile this into</font>

171
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,950
kind of a report summarizing the

172
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,080
experience with sort of some more more

173
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,030
details so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll i'll definitely publish</font>

174
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,639
publish something over the summer about

175
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,159
this and and you're you're planning to

176
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,139
do this again<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year I mean someone</font>

177
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,820
is planning to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah someone will</font>

178
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,650
step forward and volunteer to be chair

179
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,610
but we're definitely were yeah I'm

180
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,679
recruiting as I yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and and how</font>

181
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">did the students get to the meeting I</font>

182
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,780
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they get some funding to do</font>

183
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,900
that or do you need some funding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to God</font>

184
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,570
so more funding would be great we kind

185
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,700
of you know we piggybacked off of

186
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,349
real-world crypto we were co-located so

187
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,780
some students got a stipend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

188
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:57,080
real-world crypto<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few got funding</font>

189
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:00,260
directly from I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> TC ESP was loose</font>

190
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,460
who funded and some students drove up

191
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,940
from santa barbara at three in the

192
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,349
morning so it was a mix of it was a it

193
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,900
was a mix of scrabbling together

194
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:13,729
resources for students to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

195
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:16,370
super well<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught thank you as a member</font>

196
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:18,979
of Student Program Committee I just want

197
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say thank you i'll learn lots from</font>

198
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,120
you and it was a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity and I</font>

199
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,190
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Susan to</font>

200
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,990
participate and I hope you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font>

201
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,990
this process for next year thank you

202
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,580
well I asked you offline but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

203
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,479
wanted you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know have the conversation</font>

204
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,090
for the room which was how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of your</font>

205
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,780
students were women are underrepresented

206
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:47,720
minorities and I think your answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

207
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,550
for women out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 40 yeah so I</font>

208
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,160
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to make that a goal for you</font>

209
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,020
next year it is for sure yeah so small

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,110
for out of 40 this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you giving its as low</font>

211
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,819
it's roughly in line with the yeah the

212
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,930
ten percent we pretty much see here at

213
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the conference yeah but that's</font>

214
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,069
definitely a you know some ideas on how

215
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,690
to how to push that number up or

216
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:10,040
definitely definitely in mine thank you

217
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,690
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know whether you guys have</font>

218
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">heard of the nips experiment where they</font>

219
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:18,050
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did this with one pc and sort</font>

220
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,250
of one shadow pc i would say i don't

221
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">know where the funding has come from</font>

222
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:26,720
Deborah gist offered something but i

223
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,910
think i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to see there's anyway</font>

224
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
maybe not next year to have that nips

225
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,760
experiment replicated as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland</font>

226
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,650
experiment just to see so so nips

227
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,510
experiment was they actually did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font>

228
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,800
there was a shadow pc not students

229
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,650
exactly the same composition

230
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,359
professorson and what they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

231
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,360
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some agreement among the top</font>

232
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,300
papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that there was no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but</font>

233
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,270
there is sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> transie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would have</font>

234
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,040
very much hope that we could sort of get

235
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,839
more data along the lines of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nips</font>

236
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
experiment maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCS is willing to do</font>

237
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,760
that we as you'll see in the next few

238
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,620
slides so we have several experiments

239
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,600
that were ongoing this year and we are

240
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,900
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spirit of</font>

241
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:14,330
experimentation next year but yeah

242
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,860
thanks so much now the her back to some

243
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,140
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was there at the</font>

244
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,170
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> vitaly showed that he's on an</font>

245
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,990
airplane right now so we actually added

246
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,670
a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reviews but we did not</font>

247
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,410
see him increase in the number of

248
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,990
submitted papers really from the

249
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,160
previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> year so this was a big change</font>

250
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that year where there was like</font>

251
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty five percent more submissions and</font>

252
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,880
twenty percent more accepted papers now

253
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,940
on that note both use nicks and

254
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">CCS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this year have been seeing growth in</font>

255
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,070
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of submitted papers at twelve</font>

256
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:54,380
percent at usenix and i think twenty

257
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,020
eight percent at ccs i heard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

258
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:00,170
i don't know if it's correct but at

259
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,710
least there's lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ccs submissions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

260
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:06,290
we'll see maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we didn't see an</font>

261
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:09,200
increased number of submissions here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

262
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">think on that node of not increasing the</font>

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,420
reason why there is not an increase in

264
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,329
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attendees over last year</font>

265
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,880
actually there's a drop maybe because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

266
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,280
the overlap with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCS deadline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

267
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,260
at least several groups were hard at

268
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,839
work and did not come because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

269
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,430
and so at least anecdotally that may

270
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:34,910
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible so let's go on we</font>

271
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually had an appeals process instead</font>

272
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,170
of rebuttals this was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

273
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,060
experiments we had early rejects so that

274
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,860
people could in fact start working on

275
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,650
their papers for another contract

276
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,260
conference and then you could appeal

277
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:52,790
that early reject instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of writing a</font>

278
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:56,120
traditional rebuttal only<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten submission</font>

279
00:11:52,790 --> 00:12:01,819
authors chose to use that opportunity of

280
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:04,250
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten sort of early rejected papers</font>

281
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,770
that were appealed the expert

282
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,920
adjudicator saw something wrong with the

283
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,829
previous review process and so there

284
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,410
were more reviews for three<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

285
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">papers one of the papers with more</font>

286
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,510
reviews made it all the way through the

287
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:23,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">pc meeting but unfortunately was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

288
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,819

289
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,900
unfortunately we decided and I think

290
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,760
usenix made the same mistake of allowing

291
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,069
the rest of the papers the ones that

292
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,620
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not headed for early rejection to</font>

293
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:41,900
submit an appeal and an overwhelming

294
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:45,620
number 70 out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 200 decided to use that</font>

295
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:48,350
opportunity and wrote what to all

296
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,320
parties involved felt mostly like

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,330
traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> appeals traditional</font>

298
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,990
rebuttals so these were not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Appeals</font>

299
00:12:53,330 --> 00:13:01,920
which were like factually wrong

process bad motives or or something else

301
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,029
something seriously wrong with the

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:11,639
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of red as in general</font>

303
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,680
everybody's unhappy the reviewers are

304
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,120
unhappy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume of papers and</font>

305
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,849
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of the papers they</font>

306
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,850
review they write reviews that express

307
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,620
how unhappy they are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors when</font>

308
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,170
they see those reviews they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

309
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">unhappy and they even feel if you tell</font>

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">them only complain if you see tremendous</font>

311
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,579
flaws and unfair treatment and so on a

312
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,229
third of them will complain and say that

313
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,300
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely unacceptable that's</font>

314
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically the bar that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">appeals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and this reflects the</font>

317
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:51,690
community three only three out of the 70

318
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:54,149
were seen as being like wrong enough for

319
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:57,029
extra reviews they got even more reviews

320
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:02,699
than regular papers one of those was in

321
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:04,350
fact accepted now as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tally said</font>

322
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:07,260
there's actually there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a paper that</font>

323
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:10,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">was headed for early reject that was</font>

324
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,910
saved not by the appeals process in fact

325
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,510
the appeals process would not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> saved</font>

326
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,689
this paper it was saved by a pc member

327
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,329
saying look we actually this paper has

328
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,769
to continue which is what the pc is

329
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,170
therefore you're allowed to go and

330
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:27,420
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at other papers and so on</font>

331
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've all been on pcs or many of us</font>

332
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,680
so it was saved by the regular process

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,579
not by the appeals process interestingly

334
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,589
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjudicator with total expert in the</font>

335
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:40,790
domain like you could not have asked and

336
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:43,440
completely impartial like had no stake

337
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,240
rejected the appeal so if it had<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

338
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,100
been the appeal and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> this PC member</font>

339
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,569
the paper would have been rejected early

340
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,680
rejected but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was here at this</font>

341
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:54,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference so so we have a sort of at</font>

342
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,620
least some anecdote that there's a lot

343
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,709
of randomness in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed the</font>

344
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,870
nips experiment now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that</font>

345
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:04,589
we did which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a notable</font>

346
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,610
experiment was we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this</font>

347
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:09,970
special process for certain groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

348
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,180
where there's a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> author</font>

349
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:17,129
on many papers up to 10 12 papers I've

350
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,810
heard numbers as high as 18 in the past

351
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:21,910
and we drew a line and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

352
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">controversial and we really don't have</font>

353
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,060
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into all of the controversy</font>

354
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,970
but we drew a line somewhere and we said

355
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,060
a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> author cannot be on more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

356
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,180
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> non systemization of knowledge</font>

357
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,949
papers without some repercussions those

358
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,660
repercussions are basically that they

359
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:41,469
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> include any previous reviews and</font>

360
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:45,730
so on it's a voluntary thing now

361
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">interestingly most of these sort of</font>

362
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,279
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we know have a tradition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

363
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:54,550
submitting a lot of papers did<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

364
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,490
submit three papers and those papers had

365
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,310
a significantly higher chance of being

366
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,740
accepted which actually was kind of our

367
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:07,029
intent is try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on</font>

368
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,709
a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of papers and try to get those</font>

369
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:11,920
in the best shape possible for an

370
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Auckland submission and we saw that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

371
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,959
least from the acceptance numbers that

372
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,410
held true also there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

373
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,109
groups that decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to submit a lot of</font>

374
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,490
papers and just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the bulk</font>

375
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:29,379
process and their acceptance rate was

376
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,910
actually very low like significantly

377
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:35,800
lower than the average so one could say

378
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,079
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the submissions bulk submission</font>

379
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,319
strategy may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have had an effect at least</font>

380
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,420
the number of submissions did not grow

381
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,800
now previous year there were 44

382
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,300
additional papers were seeing huge

383
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,779
growth in both usenix and ccs now with

384
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said this bulk submission thing was</font>

385
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:57,939
a reasonably successful experiment but

386
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,550
it's not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really solves</font>

387
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:03,849
the issue in any way in our community so

388
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,260
Brian parno hopefully can join<font color="#CCCCCC"> me here</font>

389
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a more</font>

390
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,829
radical or non radical depending on how

391
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,419
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it proposal so Brian and I</font>

392
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,688
would like to propose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this business</font>

393
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:20,799
meeting that we be given a mandate to

394
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:23,760
plan over the next year a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vldb like</font>

395
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,920
submission process for I Triple E

396
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,010
security and privacy so the concrete ask

397
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,990
is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a mandate over the next</font>

398
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,690
year to plan and lay the groundwork for

399
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,640
such a process if people don't know the

400
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,160
veal to be like process it's basically

401
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,540
an ongoing submission process every

402
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,300
month there's a deadline you can submit

403
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,629
that month and the reviewing process is

404
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">also ongoing and you will get responses</font>

405
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,100
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a couple of months and</font>

406
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,960
you will know whether your paper was

407
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:58,419
approved or not often there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

408
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:02,470
provision and now at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> May 2017</font>

409
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,290
business meeting the plan which will by

410
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,550
then be like no surprise to anybody will

411
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:11,560
be either approved or rejected we are

412
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,120
asking mandate to set everything in

413
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,060
motion so that if the plan is approved

414
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,409
then then ongoing submissions can open

415
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,300
in June 2017 if the plan is rejected

416
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,630
then there won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> any major</font>

417
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,310
consequences these standing pc will

418
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,580
basically not be a standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc but</font>

419
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:32,800
rather a regular one so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

420
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,840
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through and maybe each of us</font>

421
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">will look at the next few slides we have</font>

422
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">just some sort of more information about</font>

423
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,220
this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might expect so Brian maybe</font>

424
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:46,389
you can talk a little bit about the

425
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,980
goals as so our goal is to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and give</font>

426
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,210
people more opportunities to submit

427
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,180
papers to Oakland and to try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

428
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">good results out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the public into the</font>

429
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,780
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> community faster so if you have</font>

430
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,190
a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> in February you shouldn't</font>

431
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,960
have to wait until the following may to

432
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,990
have your your paper appear or to get

433
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,750
get feedback on it and part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

434
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,880
both to increase the rapidity with which

435
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,890
we can disseminate good research and

436
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">also to reduce the pressure on people to</font>

437
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,240
say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the night before the</font>

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">deadline I have to submit tonight or I'm</font>

440
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,770
submit again to Oakland or even to the

441
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,650
next conference say two ND SS or<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCS in</font>

442
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,639
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall or spring and at the same time</font>

443
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're hoping that this will help</font>

444
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,810
increase the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of both the papers</font>

445
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,220
they come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this process and and</font>

446
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,740
the reviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> that authors receive during</font>

447
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process so the hope that is it if</font>

448
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're only submitting papers when</font>

449
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,710
they're ready when they're they're good

450
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,730
to go then

451
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,320
that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the review process were</font>

452
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,159
already a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more pleasant than it is</font>

453
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,299
today that by having this route

454
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,010
possibility for a revision that

455
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,510
reviewers can focus on what would it

456
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,669
take to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a good paper rather</font>

457
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,870
than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do to sort of cut down</font>

458
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,870
on the number of papers we can have at

459
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,529
the conference and I also means<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can</font>

460
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,559
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more of a dialogue</font>

461
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:59,539
between the reviewers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their authors</font>

462
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,100
so you can understand where both sides

463
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,299
are coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work through the</font>

464
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,760
issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be in the initial</font>

465
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:07,100
submission and finally to move from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

466
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,440
system where for all the unfortunate CCS

467
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,699
reviewers in the audience who just got

468
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,710
emailed about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 some papers coming</font>

469
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,720
their way instead maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> each month you</font>

470
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,159
get an email it says here your two

471
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,169
papers you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to review this month and</font>

472
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,750
we're hoping that that leads to a little

473
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:25,789
bit more humane and satisfying review

474
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:27,740
process right so it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> noted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

475
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,658
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really talking about greatly</font>

476
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,340
expanding the scope of what papers are

477
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,080
showing up but the venue we're really

478
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,600
talking about improving things for the

479
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,120
papers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really deserve to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

480
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,760
but maybe after like one or two rounds

481
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,158
through the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of refinement mill by</font>

482
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,340
building in a refinement mill into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

483
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,690
process itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact very often and</font>

484
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,730
certainly this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> true for a lot of</font>

485
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,770
papers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it to the pc meeting</font>

486
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,870
this year it's very clear that this is

487
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">good work that will in fact be published</font>

488
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,129
at a venue of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar standing is</font>

489
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oakland it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite ready yet</font>

490
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:04,760
and this especially when it happens two

491
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,178
or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> times as can easily happen a</font>

492
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,289
four or five times is not unheard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

493
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,789
greatly increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of work</font>

494
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:12,408
that the entire community has to spend

495
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:14,809
on reviewing so one of the things we

496
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,940
want to do is to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font>

497
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:18,230
process in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

498
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,490
reviewing process better but also

499
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,380
reduces work overall now details on the

500
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,990
vldb process we really focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

501
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,299
we also collected data so we spoke at

502
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,159
length with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldb people but also pets</font>

503
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,799
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on there is more</font>

504
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,419
conferences that are starting to go down

505
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,480
this route so they have a once-a-month

506
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,220
submission deadline the reviews are

507
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned around in about six weeks and so</font>

508
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,350
you definitely will be middle of

509
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:49,010
revisions or have prepared some other

510
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,689
version two<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later the accepts are</font>

511
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,490
only about the same as what we're seeing

512
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:56,450
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about twenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent or similar</font>

513
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,100
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCS and the rejection rate is still</font>

514
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,940
that of a normal conference it's not

515
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,080
like archive where everything gets in or

516
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,950
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets in eventually after</font>

517
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,830
multiple rounds in fact most papers get

518
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,630
revised but only once there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

519
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">small percentage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets accepted</font>

520
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,940
without revision but then only eighty

521
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,370
percent of the revised papers get

522
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,190
accepted and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the total</font>

523
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">rejection figure so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

524
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,630
shepherding as I know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from OSD I or I</font>

525
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,460
so SP or similar conferences that have

526
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,140
mandatory shepherding this is really a

527
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,940
revision process where there's a very

528
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">significant chance that if you don't do</font>

529
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,290
the right thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rejected and</font>

530
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,270
where the right thing is what you

531
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,850
establish in collaboration with your

532
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:44,720
reviewers with the help of the pc now

533
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:46,610
this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> how vldb is doing it we</font>

534
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,630
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily intend to follow this</font>

535
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:54,229
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the letter except for the rapid</font>

536
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,270
submission a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of deadline rate the</font>

537
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:01,390
but the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we want to</font>

538
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of keep the spirit of this and the</font>

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,050
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have an open and transparent</font>

540
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,480
process to figure out exactly the

541
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:11,020
details of what we would adopt in our

542
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,810
community where we involve everybody so

543
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:18,980
if you hear some data from<font color="#CCCCCC"> vldb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more so</font>

544
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,389

submitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the last minute there's</font>

546
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,740
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big bulky or spike at the</font>

547
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,209
end interestingly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to great</font>

548
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,560
lengths to people who have taunted this

549
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,930
process in other communities and the

550
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,909
change is incremental so it's not the

551
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">case that the first year all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> papers</font>

552
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,140
come early no<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the first year</font>

553
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,980
is mostly similar to a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

554
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:45,470
but then the submissions in the early

555
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,350
months start increasing you can clearly

556
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,940
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> an effect of other deadlines here</font>

00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can see the dip in both of them as</font>

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:04,450
people decide to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font>

openly we want to have a vote which

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,880
of heard quite clearly that there's

575
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,820
little enthusiasm for establishing a

576
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,460
journal as pets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an vldb have done</font>

577
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,550
this people feel quite happy with this

578
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,740
being a conference not associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

579
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,570
separate journal there's a strong desire

580
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,210
to have some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC meeting where</font>

581
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,879
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the networking and sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of overall</font>

582
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,450
holistic view of the community and

583
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,830
what's happening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can we</font>

584
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,770
actually have many ideas on how that

585
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">might happen in some form and there are</font>

586
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,960
more radical proposals but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

587
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:14,180
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through them here we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

588
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,090
those as part of the process so some

589
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,550
people feel that just adding more sort

590
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,570
of rapid submission is not doing enough

591
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:27,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">but as I said we'd like a mandate to</font>

592
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,840
start at least the discussion so in

593
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,490
particular there's we would like this to

594
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,370
have positive changes on the entire

595
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,530
community and we'll start by sort of

596
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,520
surveying what is the community's

597
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,910
feeling about the current situation

598
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,800
right now and try to design some metrics

599
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,290
for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive or negative changes</font>

600
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,800
and we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to coordinate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

601
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:54,620
other main sort of top-tier security

602
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:57,379
venues now I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just finish with the ask</font>

603
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,679
and so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> some discussion we would</font>

604
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:04,640
like your vote to start planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> now at</font>

605
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:11,930
this meeting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I'll take it to</font>

606
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the floor yes can you great okay so I'm</font>

607
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,220
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Goldberg if you don't know me I'm on</font>

608
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,050
the board of the privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> enhancing</font>

609
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,050
technology symposium paths where

610
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,930
as you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a very similar</font>

611
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:28,940
thing this is we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished our</font>

612
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:31,820
second year of the new system we didn't

613
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,100
go for an every month deadline we

614
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:38,330
originally planned every other month but

615
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:42,110
then it turned out it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was way too hectic</font>

616
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:44,020
on the pc and we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> every three</font>

617
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:48,139
months so we have four times a year

618
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:51,740
submissions now in the pets for pets it

619
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,110
turned out really<font color="#CCCCCC"> well with an asterisk</font>

620
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,200
or two but mostly really well

621
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,270
submissions are way up in fact we're

622
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,970
stressing a little bit we added a day a

623
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:04,070
whole day to the conference and we're

624
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,520
still kind of not sure how we're going

625
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,379
to fit all the papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font>

626
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,040
said so it worked really well for pets

627
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:18,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am opposed to doing it for Oakland</font>

628
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:26,149
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I think this</font>

629
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not crazy enough okay so yeah it's</font>

630
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,390
actual proposal I would see I know you

631
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:35,030
said you discuss crazy things as later

632
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:38,660
part of the process but the actual thing

633
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:41,420
I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see which this is not a</font>

634
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,700
first step toward which is why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

635
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,730
think we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and then fix it</font>

636
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,970
later is have an all year round

637
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:52,760
submission process like you say feeding

638
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,740
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top tier conferences not just</font>

639
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Oakland so i don't i don't see why this

640
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,100
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a step in that direction</font>

641
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,810
certainly a crazy direction and and so

642
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,620
on you know compared to this modest

643
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:05,899
proposal but we are asking for a mandate

644
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,399
to start the planning process which

645
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,310
we're going to do openly and which would

646
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,540
include like suggestions<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

647
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:15,530
coordinating between all of the venues

648
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,600
and feeding it to them sounds great<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

649
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:21,379
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's probably extremely hard to</font>

650
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,929
pull off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would disagree that like</font>

651
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,790
saying no to this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you're going</font>

652
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,830
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait a while before anybody</font>

653
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:31,450
is willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do anything so but anyway</font>

654
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:34,299
so mess oh yeah

655
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,360
I'm actually in favor of it but I think

656
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing is sort of like meeting Ian</font>

657
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,789
halfway I do worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what effect it</font>

658
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:48,428
will have on the top tier conferences I

659
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:50,970
don't know I think so if we go again<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

660
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:53,919
if we go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short story to</font>

661
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,049
answer in the middle here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the two</font>

662
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,880
deadlines that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> added that there are</font>

663
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:59,860
four Sigma one of them was added so they

664
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,200
didn't have two deadlines traditionally

665
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,120
so this clearly will have an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

666
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,279
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community the second</font>

667
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,110
thing I'm thinking is that you know I

668
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:10,000
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the day of you have a good</font>

669
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,549
database poopit at uw-madison what will

670
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,970
it do to the tier not guilty or<font color="#E5E5E5"> one will</font>

671
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:19,299
it completely kill those conferences so

672
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,100
there I would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vldb there</font>

673
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,629
there's a large set of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

674
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,090
second-tier conferences and so on in the

675
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,090
database and systems community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> third</font>

676
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">tier at etc as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well vldb has not changed</font>

677
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,610
their overall acceptance rate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

678
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:35,289
presumably a lot of those rejected

679
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:40,090
papers are showing up eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

680
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:42,039
different tiers and now so this is so I

681
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,959
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we'd see an explosion and</font>

682
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:47,799
submissions as pets I seen this is

683
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,370
definitely one possibility but I think a

684
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:53,830
key part of this is to not eat the

685
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,870
papers away from all other venues so you

686
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,220
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try to have Oakland be the</font>

687
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,870
best Oakland that it can possibly be

688
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:05,529
with better paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a better</font>

689
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:08,768
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hillary I actually proposed in</font>

690
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:11,500
1995 that it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

691
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:13,539
conference that was going on and it

692
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,620
happened to be held a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a year</font>

693
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:20,529
and that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really should merge the</font>

694
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:24,268
acceptance processes however with what

695
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:27,429
you're proposing I don't understand how

696
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,320
you're going to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a program</font>

697
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:32,019
that fits into the amount of time that

698
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,350
we're contracted for at the hotel we

699
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,059
contract one two three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years in advance</font>

700
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:41,799
can't add another day

701
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:46,240
and if you fill up all of your slots for

702
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,529
papers by january thirty first what are

703
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,070
you going to do with the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:52,840
papers it I so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the that is</font>

705
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,600
definitely concerned people erased the

706
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,459
concern about sort of front loading the

707
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,230
program and there's also like huge

708
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,960
concerns about sort of equivalence

709
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,690
between areas equivalence and quality

710
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,269
between areas and so on depending on if

711
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,789
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PC meeting every single</font>

712
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:15,519
month how does that actually work those

713
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:18,669
are issues that you know are definitely

714
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,600
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss in the planning</font>

715
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,039
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe some of the I mean</font>

716
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe there are issues that can't be</font>

717
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:29,860
resolved I think from the experience of

718
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:32,350
other venues the change towards this

719
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:36,610
histogram that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here happens</font>

720
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:40,029
gradually and the submission rates are

721
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:43,539
quite manageable and relatively equally

722
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:45,220
distributed I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise that that's</font>

723
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:48,610
what would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

724
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:51,940
fully expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it would but as I said</font>

725
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:56,080
the this is again a request for a

726
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:58,360
mandate to plan and lay the groundwork

727
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,259
for such a process not to implement

728
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,879
anything right now as we've said well I

729
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,619
would suggest that it needs more

730
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:08,139
discussion than just at the business

731
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:10,689
meeting that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to have an</font>

732
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:13,389
open forum for discussing and planning

733
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,999
this and and crafting so I exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

734
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:18,939
that would mean that by the time that a

735
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:20,529
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> has rolled around we would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

736
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,179
plan that the entire community

737
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:24,429
presumably would be familiar with and

738
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:26,409
maybe has participated in crafting and

739
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:29,220
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody would feel</font>

740
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:29,220
comfortable on voting

741
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:40,730
yes so I'm young fresh<font color="#CCCCCC"> vida from UCSB</font>

742
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:44,899
and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a student's perspective</font>

743
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:46,970
on this one thing that I well to begin

744
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">with I like this solution a lot better</font>

745
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">than last year's attempt or this year's</font>

746
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,520
attempts a solution and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming as</font>

747
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:57,050
someone who did have the paper accepted

748
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,980
so it's not just sour grapes but one

749
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,220
thing that worries me about this

750
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,110
approach is let's say you submit in or

751
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,570
let's say someone submits in<font color="#E5E5E5"> January and</font>

752
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:08,570
their paper gets accepted is it

753
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,679
immediately available yes the planets

754
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,409
that it would be immediately available

755
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,540
after acceptance<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because I was</font>

756
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned that it was slowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down so so</font>

757
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the the yeah I mean part of</font>

758
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal here is to increase the rate at</font>

759
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,740
which we can publish I says the paper

760
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,480
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be published online the camera</font>

761
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,310
ready would be online in some form and

762
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,280
could be cited as to appear in the

763
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:34,909
Proceedings of Oakland 2018 or whatever

764
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:38,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah it's a cool idea and I</font>

765
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,920
actually do like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I would like to</font>

766
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">propose an idea that was going to</font>

767
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">propose so it's not wasted in that we</font>

768
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,290
can cut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a lot of this rush</font>

769
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,439
resubmission so forth by moving the

770
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:53,450
deadline of submission to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the</font>

771
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,240
notification of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous conference</font>

772
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,180
so the deadline of Oakland would have

773
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,820
been two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have</font>

774
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,100
to choose to submit your best work so

775
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,659
that has that definitely would have a

776
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,130
big impact on the community but they

777
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,870
would also delay many papers as the

778
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">rejection notice would come and you have</font>

779
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,190
no venue to submit it to until four

780
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,739
months later<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it might encourage</font>

781
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:22,159
people to work on their paper until it's

782
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:23,649
ready yes absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah I like I</font>

783
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,710
said I actually do really like this

784
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:30,470
approach though Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> McDaniel Penn</font>

785
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,418
State University so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100-percent for</font>

786
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:36,230
this ID I just have two comments the

787
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:37,699
first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as this planning</font>

788
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,380
process happens over the next 12 months

789
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:41,359
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really important for the</font>

790
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,679
community to have visibility into the

791
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,550
discussion a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

792
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,050
going to come up people are going to

793
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,730
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with things so there's some</font>

794
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">place we can put on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

795
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,339
car

796
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,490
you know what the fact is well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

797
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">about X and give people that opportunity</font>

798
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:57,319
so that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to revisit all of</font>

799
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:00,560
these issues and we can actually get to

800
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:02,390
a vote next year because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we if we go</font>

801
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,470
off and build a plan and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

802
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,250
community involved it's going to be

803
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:09,020
problem next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

804
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:13,160
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PC members this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

805
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,359
brutal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's it's a year-long</font>

806
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,618
commitment and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

807
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">something where it's going to be in the</font>

808
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,920
back your head it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be like</font>

809
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,290
being an AE for the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i would</font>

810
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,089
highly recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recommendation</font>

811
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,089
includes something about having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly</font>

812
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:28,310
sizable pc and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even consider</font>

813
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,200
something where you're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> on board</font>

814
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,640
every second or third month that way

815
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,810
that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting beaten down</font>

816
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,549
every month because i think it's just

817
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be too big alone so yeah I</font>

818
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,300
think there's a great remarks and we

819
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely want to have put some initial</font>

820
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,420
plan on the website and have a

821
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:43,310
discussion forum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some sorts that we</font>

822
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,859
can perfect get all that online and out

823
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:48,380
in the open and and yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think both</font>

824
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:51,920
vldb and pets increase their pc size to

825
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,630
some degree to achieve it and they have

826
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually done some sort of rotation</font>

827
00:35:53,630 --> 00:36:00,530
where they try not to assign new papers

828
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:04,130
to all pc members every single month so

829
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:07,220
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is evidence basically to</font>

830
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,680
show that this can be done without

831
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,020
tiring people out and so I think p.m.

832
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,730
would also have more even more evidence

833
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:23,960
you know for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> three month process</font>

834
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:26,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">from pet yeah yeah yes thank you I'm</font>

835
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">Debra shanz NSF and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just speaking</font>

836
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,770
for myself not my organization I'm not

837
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,319
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak for my organization so</font>

838
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,359
you know I this is this is a really

839
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:37,490
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and and it seems like</font>

840
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,290
sort of the tip of the iceberg in terms

841
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,169
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be solved and</font>

842
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:45,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking a to me taking a year to sort of</font>

843
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,760
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how you might first start</font>

844
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,069
through this seems like a great idea I

845
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to ask a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about one</font>

846
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:54,160
thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't understand which is</font>

847
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:56,369
one of the concerns is that we have

848
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,940
heavy loads on the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

849
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:01,650
committees for actually all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

850
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,289
conferences and you know that that load

851
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:07,319
seems to be increasing and it seems that

852
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,509
one of the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are you</font>

853
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">know resubmitting to you know making</font>

854
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:12,990
some revisions resubmitting to the next

855
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:15,779
conference and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it making</font>

856
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,269
their papers marginally better is there

857
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:22,829
something in this that it makes that

858
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:27,990
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in a sense at least for the</font>

859
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:29,369
papers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would came up at the so for</font>

860
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,220
the papers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were good enough to make</font>

861
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:34,519
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the pc meeting discussion at</font>

862
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">oakland this year which was in New York</font>

863
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,578
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bunch of them where it was</font>

864
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,019
very clear this was a good paper it

865
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,240
should be accepted and there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

866
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,779
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were not quite done well</font>

867
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,729
enough not finished there were sections

868
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:50,640
that and the rule of thumb for

869
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:53,960
shepherding is basically no new material

870
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:58,319
so we could add a shepherding process

871
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,880
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said okay you can basically</font>

872
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,650
Shepherd and<font color="#E5E5E5"> add all kinds of new</font>

873
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,160
materials but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then like do you actually</font>

874
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that in time for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the conference and</font>

875
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,140
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may actually be a while</font>

876
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:11,880
until you're done so so this is

877
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely a way for taking those papers</font>

878
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,630
that would otherwise go once or twice

879
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:20,759
through the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of washing machine</font>

880
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,829
because the time between deadlines is

881
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:25,140
actually quite short so usually the

882
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,720
significant items that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified in</font>

883
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,700
previous reviews are not necessarily

884
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,828
done before the next submission and then

885
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,180
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you don't know if they're</font>

886
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:35,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the things that are going to</font>

887
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,950
be complained about by the next

888
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,049
reviewers so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a gamble to</font>

889
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,118
do a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of work so in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

890
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:45,390
it's just better to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if it's a</font>

891
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,730
reasonable paper and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think overall</font>

892
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,558
the review load would definitely go<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

893
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:53,220
for the community especially if there

894
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:56,579
was some collaboration on this if so for

895
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,799
instance if we started collaboratively

896
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:02,430
sharing information about previous

897
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:04,410
reviews etc so just just to clarify so

898
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:07,299
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> suppose I'm a particularly</font>

899
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:13,720
obnoxious and lazy author

900
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:16,120
and I I've gotten rejected right how

901
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,100
does this prevent me from just entering

902
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,920
in again the next month renaming the

903
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,990
paper yes we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you stop me from doing</font>

904
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,820
this horrible so feel to be has a

905
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">moratorium so if you're flat out</font>

906
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,210
rejected then you're not supposed to

907
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,430
resubmit that paper again for another 4

908
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,690
12 months in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way what if you</font>

909
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,100
get rejected from Auckland today you

910
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,110
have to wait 12 months to to resubmit to

911
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oklahoma</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the PA</font>

912
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:43,780
what well to follow up though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

913
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:46,180
she's asking what how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you draw the</font>

914
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,570
line between it's a new it's the same

915
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,040
paper versus they changed the title they

916
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,510
added some things that are calling it a

917
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,320
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of work yeah I think</font>

918
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,370
that's something that we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

919
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,170
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of the planning</font>

920
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,069
process and yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'd like to</font>

921
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,240
believe that most people are going to be

922
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,370
good actor so hopefully this is only

923
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,229
going to affect a small number I think

924
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,779
one rule of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thumb might be if it's a</font>

925
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,370
same or similar author set<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

926
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,860
reviewer could write a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar one</font>

927
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,630
paragraph review for both versions then

928
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,550
then it's a resubmission so the short

929
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,010
answer is that the chairs will have to

930
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,350
do that type of judgment until we get an

931
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,930
AI popped totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

932
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,640
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to ask is the outcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

933
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,770
this planning process going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one</font>

934
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,210
plan with an up-or-down vote is it

935
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible that you know there will be</font>

936
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,620
multiple alternatives it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unclear there</font>

937
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,170
may be multiple or turn lips coming out

938
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,870
of the planning process however<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order</font>

939
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,330
to keep it simple enough to discuss in a

940
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:40,060
one-hour meeting like this most likely

941
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:42,790
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like one plan that there's also</font>

942
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,500
the question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pc and others</font>

943
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,450
engaged so since we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

944
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,820
recruiting for a pc those will have to

945
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:51,430
be willing to actually implement a plan

946
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,950
and not have too many in because is

947
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,129
there a possible outcome to say why

948
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't we use euro SP as the guinea pig</font>

949
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,510
rather than sort of going you know

950
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,569
change the top thing at once so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

951
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,710
this is slow going and the first year is

952
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,150
not going to change very much we're

953
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,930
really talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this having an</font>

954
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:14,830
effect in 2018 so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

955
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:17,560
have any effect like<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon even</font>

956
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,660
here so trying it out first at another

957
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,590
venue will photonic but this is may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

958
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,629
wondering though

959
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we need to go to the next I</font>

960
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:30,430
janjong so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chaired using X security</font>

961
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,069
last year so I thought about this a lot

962
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,230
and I'm really happy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you guys</font>

963
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,700
proposing this that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just gonna throw</font>

964
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that I'm one hundred percent for</font>

965
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:43,839
it and then I'll suroosh share one data

966
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,750
point so last year we collected as a

967
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,330
voluntarily the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors they could they</font>

968
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:52,890
can say the prior venue that they

969
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:55,690
submitted their work and so 75

970
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">submissions last year for using security</font>

971
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,160
they claim that they submitted to

972
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:03,040
oakland and out of those twenty percent

973
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,990
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 papers got accepted so if you</font>

974
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,940
think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those 20 papers in a</font>

975
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">feat that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went through this process they</font>

976
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,720
could have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe accepted with</font>

977
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,089
minor revision then you know maybe they

978
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,129
they might not have to waste<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

979
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,320
another like three or four reviewers of

980
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:21,100
using security that's one and then the

981
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,530
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a 55 / 55 papers got</font>

982
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:26,140
rejected from<font color="#E5E5E5"> oakland and rejected again</font>

983
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:30,040
from music security right probably they

984
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:32,049
got resubmit it to ccs well right so

985
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,490
then another it's our stead of three or

986
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,260
four reviewers<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they had to</font>

987
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,569
spend time pointing out the problem same

988
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,210
problems so i think these kind of issues

989
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,760
there's no way to fix I because like you

990
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:44,710
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> is conferences are independently</font>

991
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,900
run there's really hard to sort

992
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:51,750
collaborate unless there is a process

993
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,750
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but that</font>

994
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">write me they'll be awesome but i'm not</font>

995
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,009
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> like politically whether that's</font>

996
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,720
possible so without right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

997
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be a harder problem so i</font>

998
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,500
think like one thing that would come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

999
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vote and so on actually</font>

1000
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,300
the clock has run out but one thing that

1001
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:12,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">would come out the planning process is</font>

1002
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the community's thoughts on</font>

1003
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,000
this issue so they would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

1004
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,520
a forum where we would hear those

1005
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,380
thoughts even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that some people</font>

1006
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,579
might call crazy whereas those might

1007
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,599
actually be the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are necessary</font>

1008
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:28,869
so now want one more Cynthia okay Oh

1009
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:33,030
Cynthia urban and my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to do</font>

1010
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:37,510
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pc suppose a paper is in the</font>

1011
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:39,730
revision stage and of the is there a

1012
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,770
going to be a window in which they can

1013
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,480
submit their revision within a certain

1014
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:45,849
amount of time where else it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1015
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">completely considered anew and what</font>

1016
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:52,089
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a paper when the pc changes</font>

1017
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:53,140
so again i guess those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the kind of</font>

1018
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:55,150
details that will hopefully work out

1019
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,460
during the planning process but vldb

1020
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,319
model is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have up to three</font>

1021
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,040
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit the revisions and after</font>

1022
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:05,230
that is considered a new submission<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1023
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,380
suppose you know and and they also<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

1024
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the PC chair the PC members and the area</font>

1025
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,540
chairs to continue their service up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1026
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,760
three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the normal end so</font>

1027
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,800
that they can Shepherd those alone and

1028
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,990
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually brings up like the one</font>

1029
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,940
thing that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1030
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,098
enabling us to do other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than sort of</font>

1031
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,630
start the hard work of setting up a

1032
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:27,460
website forum and doing the planning

1033
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,589
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on is actually when we</font>

1034
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,990
recruit PC members we'd be asking them

1035
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:34,210
to be prepared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay on for those</font>

1036
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:36,578
extra months after their normal service

1037
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,010
would be done in preparation that next

1038
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:44,680
year they might actually be needed as a

1039
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:47,650
standing pc so with that said take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

1040
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,848
also thank you Byrne<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Brian so all</font>

1041
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">are really asking for is for for these</font>

1042
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:57,700
volunteers to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and explore this</font>

1043
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,319
concept through an open process where

1044
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,759
the community where all of you can get

1045
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:03,589
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can see the</font>

1046
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,719
discussion and so forth so

1047
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:07,130
I think personally pretty much that this

1048
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:08,450
is a no-brainer to go and at least

1049
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,880
explore this we aren't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1050
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,439
implementing any changes so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope we</font>

1051
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,499
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with a simple show of hands</font>

1052
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:19,239
all those in favor for letting them go

1053
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:23,479
forward please raise your hand thank you

1054
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,979
anyone against good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they would</font>
