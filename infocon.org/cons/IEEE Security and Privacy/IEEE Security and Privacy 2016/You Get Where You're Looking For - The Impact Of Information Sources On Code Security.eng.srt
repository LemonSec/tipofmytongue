on Stack Overflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the same thing</font>

we googled the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what then</font>

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,919
happened was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first result was</font>

was we we talked to developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:25,070

use differ when the question is security

Overflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> for problems that do whatever</font>

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we did an online</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> developers survey so we</font>

our survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like asked asked which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problems</font>

93
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:38,030
the winner was either<font color="#E5E5E5"> a search engine</font>

94
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:40,460
mostly Google or Stack Overflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like</font>

97
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,540
googled it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I clicked on a stick</font>

was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> search engine mostly Google and</font>

117
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,840
put them in isolating conditions and see

118
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,520
what happens then<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we wanted to</font>

find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there is is it reasonable way</font>

143
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,939
of them were students<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ages there was</font>

144
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,550
a wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> range but like most of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:11,090
around around<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the middle</font>

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:26,419
is international and UMD also is and

151

recruits from the US or from Germany

155
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,758
yeah then in the lab so once we had them

156
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the lab we explain to them what we're</font>

157
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,490
going to do with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we asked them</font>

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think aloud</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while they programmed and</font>

159
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,599
we practice it with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I'm saying</font>

160
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine you're doing this now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now say</font>

161
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,259
your thoughts aloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we practiced and</font>

162
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,549
with some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computer science</font>

163
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:01,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">students we had to practice for quite a</font>

164
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,680
while before they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got it and yeah so</font>

165
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:06,319
then after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we randomly assigned</font>

166
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,360
them to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> four conditions so they</font>

167
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,759
were either<font color="#E5E5E5"> only allowed to use Stack</font>

171
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,460
like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they clicked on links that</font>

172
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,770
would get them somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

173
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,080
those were blocked or they were allowed

174
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,830
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use only books which we supplied</font>

175
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,740
either as<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDFs or in print or they could</font>

176
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,228
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last condition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do whatever</font>

177
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,769
they liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had to start at Google</font>

178
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they could from there do whatever</font>

179
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:43,639
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave them four tasks to</font>

180
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:48,140
solve we cut each task<font color="#E5E5E5"> off after 20</font>

181
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,760
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we chose the tasks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that they</font>

182
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,350
could be solved in those 20 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

183
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be solved either in a</font>

184
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,459
secure way

185
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:59,000
or an insecure way with all of the

186
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,589
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we chose tasks that we</font>

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,459
thought were relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to security in</font>

188
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:07,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android apps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't want</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste a lot of time for people to</font>

190
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,480
write a complete app so we gave them a

191
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,489
skeleton Android app and it looked like

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see here the that they</font>

193
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,329
had to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android studio they had an</font>

194
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,160
emulator and like the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

195
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:22,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">skeleton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app was already in there and</font>

196
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,459
then they had to fill out fill in things

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,500
so in the first task they had to store

198
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,469
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials locally and</font>

199
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,480
persistently in the second task they had

200
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,250
to change a HTTP connection to HTTPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,500
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to actually do that</font>

202
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was added fun the service</font>

203
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,160
certificate was issued for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a subdomain</font>

204
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,250
instead of the top-level<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain while</font>

205
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,680
the link led to the top-level<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain so</font>

206
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:53,380
what they had to do was they had to

207
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement a custom host name verifier</font>

208
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we had a task</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we wanted to</font>

209
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,500
see if they would adhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the least</font>

210
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">privileged principle or not and in this</font>

211
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,870
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> for permissions so they had to make</font>

212
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,310
a phone button clickable that would then

213
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,800
call the hotline<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last task they</font>

214
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,770
had to make an activity callable from
