1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
so this work is part of a bigger project

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,660
called me TLS on building a verified

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,130
open-source TLS implementation of TLS 13

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,690
but also older versions and it's even

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,510
its immediate as<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of an</font>

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,880
you in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end what what is is so why</font>

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,769
downward is just a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of the</font>

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">parcel it's a it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece because as more downward slip can</font>

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,040
make you lose a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">potentially all the security so I want</font>

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">to introduce a downgrade on everyday</font>

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,629
experience so you get downgraded when an

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,489
attacker can make you fall back on

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:51,030
weaker security solutions when stronger

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,239
ones are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I claim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">very used to doing that so downloads can</font>

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,370
happen at the user level and the

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,109
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> level but also at the</font>

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,649
protocol level and this is the topic of

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">my talk so by now you've heard about dls</font>

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:14,040
13 and why it is important so for the

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,960
purpose of my talk want to emphasize the

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,500
TLS is not the single protocol it's a

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,580
suit of protocols that have and

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,280
negotiation mechanism that is widely

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to negotiate multiple versions and</font>

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:32,310
many more ciphers<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this happens in</font>

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,700
the in the hello message of TLS in which

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,860
the client first sends all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font>

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,840
that he supports the server chooses and

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,299
sent back<font color="#E5E5E5"> his own and the sense back</font>

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,869
that his decision what to use in his

35
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,180
hello message TLS also supports a gooda

36
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentary down with protection mechanism</font>

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,100
is part of the key confirmation

38
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,899
techniques that were discussing in the

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,899
second talk during the first talk

40
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:06,890
so the configurable configurability of

41
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:10,579
TLS allows it to adopt new cryptographic

42
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,230
algorithms by still supporting backward

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,099
compatibility so you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a similar</font>

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:21,950
slide before but this is split up into

45
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:24,890
different types of attacks and this that

46
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,510
allows a quick or HIV action to new

47
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,790
cryptographic weaknesses so you can turn

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">off old crypto and turn on New Krypton</font>

49
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,190
so for particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think that</font>

50
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,489
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important to be prepared for</font>

51
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:40,040
quantum computers and quantum attacks

52
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:42,319
however it also enables down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,470
attacks in which an attacker can<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit</font>

54
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,530
this negotiation to make client and

55
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:51,049
servers use which cryptography and the

56
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:56,060
highlighted ataxia use some form of

57
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:59,090
negotiation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bound wait so we believe</font>

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,340
that the increased number of attacks is

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,380
due to increased scrutiny after the

60
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,299
Snowden leaks but also that we need

61
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest in pls because of the new</font>

62
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:11,269
version TLS 13 and the two are linked so

63
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,880
in our opinion it's it's high time to

64
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:16,549
get things right but the fact that most

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,950
of these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are outside existing</font>

66
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,200
security models and just some of the

67
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:27,260
previous works we're trying to kind of

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,880
get to capture some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those attacks it</font>

69
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,489
shows that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still somehow in a</font>

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,799
wild west of TLS attacks where typical

71
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:39,109
security graphic security poof's do not

72
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:44,090
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us much about real-world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tags so i</font>

73
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:46,730
will single out via tax kind of my

74
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,950
Western heroes and I will call<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the</font>

good<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad and the ugly and I will use</font>

76
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,638
them to illustrate the challenges of

77
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:58,280
obtaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> down great security so</font>

78
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,519
summarizing our main contributions so we

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,079
have two general contributions for

80
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,950
making kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wild West of</font>

81
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,569
real-world protocols a bit more orderly

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,268
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> are downgrade definitions and the</font>

83
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">other is a modular poop strategy for</font>

84
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,079
proving down wit

85
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:19,320
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition we have protocol specific</font>

86
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,500
contributions in terms of attacks and

87
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,930
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> security proves in our new model so</font>

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,199
a goal here was to be dispatch our first

89
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,990
two contributions to see how they can

90
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,919
deal with with different protocols being

91
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:40,259
thrown at them so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus throughout</font>

92
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:45,330
on TLS and in particular on TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.34 our</font>

93
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:47,009
positive results so<font color="#CCCCCC"> at two main the two</font>

94
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,770
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> contributions that I will talk</font>

95
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,870
about in this talk are the downward

96
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:56,840
secured definitions that capture down

97
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,190
with aspects of the previous attacks and

98
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,320
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first contribution and the</font>

99
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,099
second contribution is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> modular proof</font>

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,180
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> downbeat fixes to TLS once we</font>

101
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,550
that have been developed together with

102
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,669
the core design teen of of TLS 13 and

103
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:17,940
that are included<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the new I think</font>

104
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:20,150
drafts or teen of of the standard so

105
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,460
setting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage for the definition I</font>

106
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,130
kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give some some notation</font>

107
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,080
for negotiation so negotiation starts

108
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,599
from client and server configurations

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,630
that describe what versions and

110
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,870
algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> cipher suit cipher Suites and</font>

111
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,469
modes client and servers I'm principal

112
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,389
willing to support then there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

113
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,130
multivalent negotiation in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is</font>

114
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,280
sent messages to each other and the

115
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,509
outcomes of that is a mode which

116
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,929
contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the negotiated version in</font>

117
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:53,820
cipher suite so we model the ideal

118
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,229
outcome of negotiation using a

119
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">preference function</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nagel that maps to</font>

120
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:03,300
configurations to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that parties</font>

121
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,949
would like to get typically this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

122
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:10,080
they would get if there is no active

123
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:12,750
attacker present so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain using</font>

124
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,409
that terminology by existing security

125
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,979
definitions do not capture downgrade so

126
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,449
I take authentication as an example and

127
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:24,240
typically authentication says that if my

128
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:27,419
negotiated mode uses strong algorithms

129
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,400
then my partner and I agree on the keys

130
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,719
the identities the mode and the

131
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,719
potentially the whole the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

132
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:36,599
transcript but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not secured</font>

133
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:39,449
to guarantee downgrade protection

134
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,010
because authentication does not

135
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,760
guarantee negotiation of a strong load

136
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:48,419
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically where it starts off of</font>

137
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,820
so if an only has such security

138
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,359
guarantees available what is required<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

139
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,969
center<font color="#E5E5E5"> section of all modes must must be</font>

140
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,409
strong in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the section of the client and</font>

141
00:06:56,969 --> 00:07:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configurations would only</font>

142
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:03,659
support strong modes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if the</font>

143
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,900
client and<font color="#E5E5E5"> server configurations support</font>

144
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:09,659
legacy algorithms for backward

145
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,609
compatibility and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the minimum</font>

146
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:14,940
requirements on the configurations to

147
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">achieve downgrade so these three bullets</font>

148
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:23,909
match up nicely with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three attacks</font>

149
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:26,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will refer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in in my talk so</font>

150
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:28,860

158
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,570
prevented by modern handshake that

authenticate the negotiation using the

160
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,550

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the following attack that is</font>

169
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,409
reminiscent of luck charm so the server

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:27,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposes so the client proposes his</font>

makes the server fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them to</font>

174
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,620

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,070

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:04,640
and then Forge the finish message so

183

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a break of key confirmation and</font>

184
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:14,339
breaks down with security of TLS 12 so

185
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,740
there's some hope of achieving a

186
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,570
stronger property namely one could sign

187

fearless once we but this is not

203
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:11,100
models in the tamarind setting so we are

204
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:13,050
we are talking so we still need some

205
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,350
good cryptography so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

206
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,359
ugly attack so if you have a downgrade

207
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,540
attack on the actual signature scheme

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,880
poisons a very old hash function and

209
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,790
this attack was published at ndss just

210
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,980
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this year then there's</font>

211
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,319
really nothing no way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we can help</font>

212
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,940
your spotter call designers so these

213
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,920
attacks would be really carefully

214
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,329
watched and old hash functions and

215
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:44,000
signature schemes should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> eliminated</font>

216
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:44,000
so they are support some wild west-style

217
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:50,150
so more<font color="#E5E5E5"> formally to capture the stronger</font>

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,880
attacker model we formally define a down

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> predicate DP the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toads when a</font>

details can vary the<font color="#E5E5E5"> predicate requires</font>

227
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client demands good public keys</font>

228
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,880
and signature algorithms and that the

229
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:23,780
server expresses a preference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

230
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,920
with secure version in its protocol so

231
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,120
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this requirement</font>

232
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,360
when we analyze TLS 13 the goal of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,740
negotiation is backward compatibility so

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">clients and servers can still</font>

235
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,310
interoperate with everyone so in

236
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,339
particular decline can interact with

237
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,650
servers that support<font color="#E5E5E5"> only old versions</font>

238
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,420
and the server can interact even with

239
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:50,090
clients that do not support a strong

240
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:52,069
signature scheme and moreover both

241
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:58,550
clients and servers can support<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

242
00:11:52,070 --> 00:12:01,370
groups so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a quick primer in two</font>

243
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,099
keys change models adapted to this more

244
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,370
general attacker model so we have a

245
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:11,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle that creates long-term</font>

246
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,980
keys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol instances and when</font>

247
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,810
initializing particle instances he

248
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,300
provides them with their configuration

249
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,280
so the attacker can adaptively choose

250
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,959
what these parties are willing to

251
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,420
negotiate then he drives the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol by</font>

252
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,180
using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle in which he provides</font>

253
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,449
messages and receives messages acting as

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,859
a man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and as the sessions</font>

progress in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> execution of the</font>

particle they assign variables which

257
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,050
will be used to model security so that

258
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the configurations there are some unique</font>

259
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,219
identifiers typically typically a

260
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,709
concatenation of nonsense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two</font>

261
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,290
sessions and the mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is negotiated</font>

262
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,600
and there can be more such variables for

263
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,000
other protocols I think in the key

264
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,980
confirmation talk there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was also very</font>

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,710
similar way of formulating security

266
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,300
properties so the goal of the attacker

267
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:07,430
is to make instances reach a bad state

268
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,859
where the attacker wins so a winning

269
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,630
state I will indicate those states in

270
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:17,450
wet so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that phone work here's our</font>

271
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,950
definition of down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with acuity so the</font>

272
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,800
winning state for the attacker and this

273
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,400
is the probability that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bound</font>

274
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:30,469
a is when there are two instances that

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,390
have the same unique identifier but and

276
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,000
for which the down with<font color="#CCCCCC"> predicates on</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the outcome of the ideal</font>

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,580
downgrade quake and then tackle that can

283

286
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:00,140
there's caveats to this definition

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">namely what if the attacker can make can</font>

please refer to our paper in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

down with the down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security relates</font>

306
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,150
to standard security properties such as

307
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,460
authentication and key secrecy so when

308
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,610
discussing our modular<font color="#CCCCCC"> poof strategy I</font>

309
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,650
will gain focus on TLS once we please

310
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:05,810
have a look at our paper for results on

311
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:10,280
many other<font color="#CCCCCC"> real world protocols so as</font>

312
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,869
everyone working on TLS knows the

313
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,880
standard is very complex

314
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,010
and usually the first step in writing a

315
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,370
paper doing some analysis of TLS is to

316
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:22,160
simplify the protocol so a second

317
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:28,510
contribution is to show how this can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

318
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:32,089
done in the sound manner so we don't

319
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,980
claim much novelty here but we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

320
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:36,320
these techniques will be picked up more

321
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,230
because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of this</font>

322
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:43,490
soundness issue of looking at partial

323
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:47,029
protocols that Miss attacks is really a

324
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:50,029
big problem and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice work</font>

325
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,670
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that exposes a nice exposition</font>

326
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:55,820
of this by walk away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stiga already</font>

327
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,420
in 2008 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really no excuse for for</font>

328
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,550
for not showing these simulations so how

329
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,069
does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so that is the complex</font>

330
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,279
protocol which you get from the standard

331
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,110
and then you extract from that protocol

332
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,660
a sub protocol that can be extended to

333
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,360
the complex protocol using a simulator

334
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,069
and the simulator helps to translate

335
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,930
every attack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the complex</font>

336
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,029
particle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the food protocol into an</font>

337
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,319
attack on the subcortical so if you

338
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,040
manage to prove the support the code

339
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:30,890
secure then you also proved the pool

340
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:35,599
Protocol secure and we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for TLS</font>

341
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:38,080
13 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's down with subcortical it</font>

342
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,480

<font color="#CCCCCC">that the server chooses its mode and</font>

355
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,709
proposed and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another fix that</font>

does something fancy to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

get back to in a bit so the good news is

359
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,560
that for dispatched<font color="#E5E5E5"> downgrade protocol</font>

360
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:39,860
we can show we can prove security and

361
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,929
the the proof relies on the the

362
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,850
uniqueness of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the security of</font>

363
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,590
the signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme as well as the</font>

364
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:50,060
server signing all the net work input to

365
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:55,520
the Nega function and the result but

366
00:17:50,060 --> 00:18:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">what about version downgrade so we can</font>

367
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:03,290
show that downgraded TLS 13 so can be

down with TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 132 TLS 12 and we mount</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lock charm so unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

370
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing in the TLS once we standard that</font>

371
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:16,190
could prevent such language because the

372
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,690
the version is never signed so the

373
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is how to patch one sweet</font>

374
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent downwards the finished messages</font>

375
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,330
don't help so here's something ugly

376
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,949
those that had a pure mind had should

377
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,070
should have looked away so we put the

378
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,590
server version into the server nuns and

379
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:38,149
and we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all past versions of</font>

380
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,679
TLS to obtain backward compatibility so

381
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,480
while this is a bit ugly the good news

382
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,090
is it works and so we can prove

383
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,370
downgrade security for servicing clients

384
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,740
and support all versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> including pls</font>

385
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,270
once we as long as the implement is

386
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,980
countermeasure and as long as they don't

387
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,810
support our is a key transport in which

388
00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:01,180
case they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no signatures do to</font>

389
00:18:53,810 --> 00:19:01,179
help so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all I had to say for now</font>

390
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,000
so if Anderson correctly you still need

391
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have one primitive that is that</font>

392
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">remains secure in your case a signature</font>

393
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:26,150
so could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we imagine something in which</font>

394
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:31,340
for example the security can be one of

395
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:33,020
two primitives yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that it</font>

396
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,780
definitely could be the signature scheme

397
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,690
and the psk and if you if your signature

398
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,370
scheme by bulking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you had a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> psk</font>

399
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,260
it could succeed you could still have

400
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,879
security so TLS ones we may even in

401
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,879
certain modes after property
