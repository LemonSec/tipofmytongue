00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
good afternoon everyone my name is Louie

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,068
teon I'm from Indiana University today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,650
will present<font color="#E5E5E5"> our paper together with my</font>

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,889
collaborator showing by from<font color="#CCCCCC"> chinwag</font>

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">University tilted also joint work with</font>

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:22,229
ninja my advisor cell phone ma Xiao Jing

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,229
Chong machine and professor shimmy so

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,470
look at our title understanding and

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,920
mitigating<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security risks of airport</font>

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">thiru configuration so we are talking</font>

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about Apple Barrel configuration today</font>

12
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:40,290
so in terms of the row configuration the

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,190
first concept i would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce</font>

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,760
to you it called a boundary boundary the

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,670
protocol is a protocol or zero

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,500
configuration networking that design

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:01:00,390
proposed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple so with boundary Apple</font>

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,609
want to provide the capability that with

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,299
little or no configuration you can

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,180
easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> add a new service to a network</font>

21
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:11,430
the existing devices in this network can

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,979
automatically find this new service and

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,590
connect to it through your network

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,560
administrator the no longer need to

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,869
assign IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> host name service name to your</font>

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,820
services and the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> you simply ask to</font>

27
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,640
see what network services are

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,860
automatically available for you and the

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,780
only simple thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do ada to</font>

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,640
true the service firm lift so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,570
a quick comparison with the traditional

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,240
network that required come configuration

33
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">3 in the network even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a</font>

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,579
printer<font color="#E5E5E5"> without configuration you cannot</font>

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,320
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you have to configure the</font>

36
00:01:52,579 --> 00:02:00,689
you have to configure the IP the

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,658
hostname the DF the order to connect but

38
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,548
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability we don't like</font>

39
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,780
configuration we want everything to be

40
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,520
automatic so we have wondered so we want

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to eat service to configure itself</font>

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,280
automatically we want your printer

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,290
our to configure its own IP hostname we

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,530
want the client to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:26,570
automatically discover the services that

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,640
are available without any pre knowledge

47
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:33,810
so you want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you so you want</font>

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:38,220
to know how typical example so you want

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,980
to add a printer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a network following</font>

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,460
boundary protocol the printer configured

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,070
itself through asking a couple question

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,080
to the network so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one if</font>

53
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:55,109
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP if no the printer</font>

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,230
will take this IP second is anybody

55
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">using the hostname if no the printer</font>

56
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,140
relatively the hostname also the printer

57
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,460
configured its service instance name is

58
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,000
that you need in the network so the

59
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,460
printer of initially configure itself

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,680
next let's see how a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client is able to</font>

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,680
automatically discover this new printer

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:28,530
look for the client the<font color="#E5E5E5"> macbook a couple</font>

63
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,320
question to the network anyone had a

64
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,350
printer service the printer birthday<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,440
have one next so on which hoped it did

66
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,769
service the printer ability is all hoped

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,000
blah blah so the client is able to find

68
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,850
this new printer and added printer to

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,210
your printer list so I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

70
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,390
here for you the printer had three

71
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,150
attributes the IP the hostname the

72
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,059
service name so which of the three

73
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:05,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">attributes do you think our failed bite</font>

74
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:08,550
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lift Apple gives us the under</font>

75
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,420
application door service instance name

76
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,840
so if the IP port or hostname changed

77
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,599
the application can still connect so

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,740
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple it hit the service</font>

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,450
instance name that is filled so in the

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,940
future whenever you print that we all

81
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the printer you print it to a</font>

82
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,010
printer

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,080
who owned this very of name so remember

84
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:39,730
remember this equation i will show you

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:43,090
what this means to attack her later so

86
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:47,560
our a lottery in the network you already

87
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,929
have unaffectedly delighted you are the

88
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,470
attacker we assume the attacker had

89
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,950
control on one device in this network

90
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,500
the attacker able to intercept secret

91
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:07,080
files transferred between the dining<font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font>

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:10,510
to the devices so<font color="#CCCCCC"> your previous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,719
the American printed are infected and

94
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:17,500
they are the watery want to intercept

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> printing documents so let's break</font>

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> row configuration and the first kv</font>

97
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,200
the printer printer so in the network

98
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:31,690
that the attacker had a control on one

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:34,990
device the battery<font color="#CCCCCC"> claim that i have a</font>

100
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,020
printer is named blah blah which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

101
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,100
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same name with the wicket in</font>

102
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,409
printer so the printer falling boundary

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,760
protocol it will configure itself again

104
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,830
and change to a new theory of<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,890
recall our previous equation there

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll see if the printer means a</font>

107
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,419
printer who owned this service name so

108
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,300
when you print it will seal the printer

109
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually print it to the the word</font>

110

read device and the malicious device

111
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,240
become the main the middle so why did it

112
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,610
happen we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are three</font>

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,950
changing attributes that are self

other to change that you can still

117
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:31,060
connect which just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font>

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,450
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental problem it the</font>

119
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:37,450
lack of authentication in the protocol

120
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:39,940
the protocol only anyone can claim any

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:48,490
no duplicates but not secured let's take

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> elephant our service at this moment</font>

142
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:58,160
if the adversary give the answer that it

143
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:01,549
all hoped Bob dot I'm act local if this

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,420
answer comes first and victim the reply

145
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:08,410
came the second then the macbook<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

146
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,900
take it as Alice of the iphone had

service<font color="#CCCCCC"> named de blah blah which aids</font>

148
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:19,400
all hoped both iMac which it totally

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,500
wrong so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens next if when the</font>

150

157
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:55,939
us prevent the attack

158
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:59,890
the answer is no so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say if you</font>

159
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect to the wrong device using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> https</font>

using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname you will find that</font>

161
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:12,949
the that hoped is yielding a certificate

162
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:15,769
issued to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple ID dot PDF blah blah</font>

163
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,550
this is a really the certificate issued

164
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:23,000
by Apple the only problem is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea who is the legitimate user behind</font>

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,720
this app ID you will actually even if

you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right device you will</font>

168
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">face exactly the same problem even if</font>

169
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,709
you connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a leaf the iphone you</font>

170
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,449
will find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a leaf is yielding a</font>

172
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,720
you just have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> who in the user</font>

173
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,089
behind it app ID so basically the

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,640

177
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,390
take a quick look at traditionally how a

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,660

179
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,360

the certificate however he airdrop the

domain you are connecting to you will

184
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:24,050
never match it the certificate so this

185
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,230
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem to let take a quick recap</font>

fundamental problem that linking a human

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,050
to her certificate it complicated

191
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,540
they're the challenge in finding any

this is what they did and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we believe</font>

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still a open question and we</font>

zero configuration techniques are not

effects its security however addressing

326
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,669
such security risks is not true due to

tanjong microsoft research so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've used</font>

335
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,350
airdrop a lot with my husband and then

336
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:37,389
my experience was that in a band he sent

337
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:40,850
something I get I have to click that I'm

338
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:44,959
receiving this data from Stuart's iphone

339
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,879
only then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's started transmitting so I</font>

340
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,919
was wondering whether but that's not

341
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:50,840
what you showed in the video so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

342
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,119
wondering whether you know that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

343
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,649
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix for the problem that you indicated</font>

344
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,350
so that's the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one and</font>

345
00:18:54,649 --> 00:19:00,320
the number two is so we looked at some

346
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:03,738
home kit devices the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple has a home</font>

347
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,619
kit for the smart things I smart home

348
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:07,730
devices and protocols and then we also

349
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:10,369
found out that the home kit

350
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:13,519
automatically discovers those home kit

351
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:16,158
devices in the same networks for iOS

352
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,019
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> care so have you looked at whether</font>

353
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:22,659
these are this could be also vulnerable

354
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:25,309
for those zero configuration attacks

355
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay for the first of questions even if</font>

356
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:34,668
or the user needs to click on the button

357
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:37,820
for example accept it also it's affected

358
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:41,119
by our attack because a low-tech were

359
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:45,019
the main method hacker can trust out the

360
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,899
scepter the<font color="#E5E5E5"> photo and then transfer the</font>

361
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:51,440
foothold to the victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> or server and</font>

362
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:55,459
then the victim Mercer<font color="#E5E5E5"> will still how</font>

363
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,350
this except<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter I think it's the</font>

364
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">Honorable yeah the attack is totally</font>

365
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,248
transparent yeah to be a recipient it's

366
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:07,340
totally film so that their tacit of do

367
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:11,509
see the accept button your attack at the

368
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:14,269
recipient ortho need to click the effect

369
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:15,499
but except except partici<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

370
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:17,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">biggest ever surprised that this</font>

confirmation button doesn't do doesn't

372

take any people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know doesn't know other</font>

authors<font color="#E5E5E5"> regarding your second question</font>

374
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,050
we didn't look into the whole kid thing

375
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:32,360
uh a lot but you really

376
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,320
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah our research we are still</font>
