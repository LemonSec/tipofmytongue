00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,820
how users learn to be secure so as we

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,119
all know there's a multitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> of advice</font>

emergency readiness team offers 30,000

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,970
words of advice which is about half the

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,090
average novel and this advice is on 60

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,879

<font color="#E5E5E5">40,000 words and if you go through all</font>

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,540
the Google results you'll find more and

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,550
more and more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for physical security</font>

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,219
there's almost an equal amount of advice

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,739
and so somehow users are filtering

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,690
through all the advice and rejecting

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,690
most of it and picking some of it to

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,379
take and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand how</font>

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,968
that filtering process worked um so we

23
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,190
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand where users got</font>

24
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">advice but more importantly how they</font>

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,869
evaluate advice and how they decide what

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,360
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that millions of thousands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of words</font>

27
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,740
to take and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">know whether users with different</font>

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,929
backgrounds made different types of

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,909
choices so our users who are security

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,100
sensitive or users with different

32
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,470
socioeconomic backgrounds doing

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,570
different things and so in order to

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,030
evaluate this we conducted a

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,798
semi-structured interview study and we

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,200
wanted to contract an interview study

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,450
rather than a closed answer survey or

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,030
more quantitative method because no

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,189
prior work has looked at why and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,590
users are making this analysis and we

41
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,329
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the flexibility to really</font>

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,189
get into their reasoning beyond just

43
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,860
what's the prevalence of what they're

44
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,559
doing and so it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a very diverse participant</font>

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,240
base so that we were drawing you know

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasonable generalizable conclusions so</font>

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,809
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> recruited our participants by</font>

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,850
craigslist emails to companies and

50
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,560
flyering and then we conducted these

51
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,469
hour-long interviews with 25

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,680
participants and so what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk to</font>

53
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">them about we focused on both digital</font>

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,690
and physical security security because

55
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,940
we are curious to see

56
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,500
if the more well developed domain of

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,600
physical security could offer some

58
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,090
information on what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do better in</font>

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,030
digital security so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked about</font>

60
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,370
authentication and passwords antivirus

61
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,880
use online banking and shopping as well

62
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">as two-factor authentication and then in</font>

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,290
physical security we asked how they

64
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,600
secured their homes how they secured

65
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,429
their method of transit and then also

66
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,890
how they stayed safe and walking alone

67
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,260
at night and when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are asking about</font>

68
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">these different behaviors we are using</font>

69
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,910
this to facilitate questions about how

70
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,830
they learn these behaviors what were

71
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,230
their information sources why did they

72
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,110
choose to practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behaviors they</font>

73
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,329
practiced or reject other strategies and

74
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,670
did they see advice that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't</font>

75
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,470
didn't take and then also did they have

76
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,119
negative experiences with certain

77
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,220
behaviors and what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,200
them and then finally we asked in

79
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,120
general if you were to go look for

80
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,190
digital security advice or physical

81
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,420
security advice where would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look how</font>

82
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,810
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you evaluate</font>

83
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:18,260
and so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we conducted these</font>

84
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,850
interviews we analyzed and coded them so

85
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,579
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we had the</font>

86
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,859
interviews transcribed word by word then

87
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,510
to researchers read all of the interview

88
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,030
transcripts and developed a code book

89
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,190
that means they look for common phrases

90
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,860
say multiple participants saying I

91
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,609
received advice from a man and they

92
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,220
designated male advice as a code and so

93
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,280
we generated around 40 codes and then

94
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,989
the two researchers independently coded

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,630
all of the interview transcripts and

96
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:49,489
then came back together<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate how</font>

97
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,799
well their codes matched on each

98
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,500
transcript in this case there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about</font>

99
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,989
a 75-percent inter coder agreement rate

100
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,420
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is reasonable for an exploratory</font>

101
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">study such as this one and then we</font>

102
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,010
iterated to make sure we agreed on the

103
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,959
final codes and finally we look through

104
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of those codes and identified the</font>

105
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,310
main themes that I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the</font>

106
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:14,180
rest of the talk so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get to the</font>

107
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,250
themes who are participants so we had 25

108
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,400
participants and our university is

109
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,350
located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Washington</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DC area and so</font>

110
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">our participants were slightly more</font>

111
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,190
female than the DC area

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,750
they were also wealthier but they did

113
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,030
have educational attainment

114
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,520
representative of our area and they are

115
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,609
also racially representative and so we

116
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,140
do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they give a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable</font>

117
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,750
representation of how users might be

118
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,419
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and evaluating advice and in</font>

119
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,170
general DC is a bit more racially

120
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,540
diverse and better educated than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

121
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,970
so what did we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out we found some</font>

122
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,420
interesting trends in how users evaluate

123
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,510
advice how security sensitivity impacts

124
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">advice sources and beliefs and then the</font>

125
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,580
usefulness of negative security

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,460
experiences so focusing first on advice

127
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,039
evaluation we asked for each behavior

128
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,739
why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not to use</font>

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,960
this particular strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what we</font>

130
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,390
found out was that participants tended

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,370
to evaluate digital security advice

132
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,650
based on how much they trusted the

133
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,570
source so if their dad gave them some

134
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,940
advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they trusted their dad as a</font>

135
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,550
digital security authority they<font color="#E5E5E5"> took his</font>

136
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,830
advice wholesale but with physical

137
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,290
security advice they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually kind of</font>

138
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,940
assess the information the dad gave them

139
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,630
and decided whether it made sense for

140
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,060
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one participant said with</font>

141
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,100
computer security I'm securing myself

142
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,770
from threats but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't even know</font>

143
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,960
anything about I know when somebody

144
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,510
walks up with a gun that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

145
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,849
worried and so in addition to this sort

146
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,440
of evaluation difference we also heard

147
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard for digital security</font>

148
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,700
be tangible I don't know whether there's

149
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">a threat I don't know how to evaluate</font>

150
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,840
what this means for me and so that

151
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">brings up the question of whether maybe</font>

152
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,780
we can bring this physical security

153
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:09,270
tangibility into the digital domain and

154
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,760
then participants also rejected advice

155
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,310
for containing too much marketing and

156
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,289
for threatening their privacy so this

157
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,180
was in addition to kind of the regular

158
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,640
reasons of inconvenience and lack of

159
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,640
risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it occurred almost equally as</font>

160
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,310
often and so one participant said I

161
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,280
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any advice with a price tag</font>

162
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,669
attached I did have my identity stolen

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,609
one time but I was able to fix it I'm

164
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,060
not one of those people who signs up for

165
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,240
identity theft protection

166
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,160
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like that and so in addition</font>

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
to not liking marketing material in

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,270
their advice we heard from three

169
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,340
participants that sort of disdain for

170
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,840
anyone who would take advice the

171
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">contained marketing material or by</font>

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,590
security tools and then with regard to

173
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,560
privacy one participant<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I think I</font>

174
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,289
do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that two-factor authentication</font>

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,600
capacity but I've always declined based

176
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,040
on what I know about gmail it just

177
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,280
seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like giving up too much</font>

178
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">information to Google and so this we</font>

179
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,900
heard multiple multiple times was I

180
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to give up my phone number I</font>

181
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to give up my private data</font>

182
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,780
and whatever possible security benefit i

183
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,100
get from two-factor can't possibly be

184
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,349
worth the risk that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

185
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,940
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a text me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah and so that's sort</font>

186
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,490
of an important consideration we hadn't

187
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,430
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about before with regard to</font>

188
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,790
security sensitivity and again security

189
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,800
sensitivity was whether someone held

190
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,080
government security clearance or worked

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,370
with HIPAA or FERPA data which is health

192
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,710
or student data that's government

193
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">controlled and so we found that these</font>

194
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,750
security sensitive users is differed in

195
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,150
behavior sources and beliefs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

196
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,830
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two factor again they were much</font>

197
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,739
more likely to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use two-factor</font>

198
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,630
authentication than general participants

199
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,729
and perhaps this is because they better

200
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,200
understood the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-offs or they</font>

201
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,940
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> security is more important</font>

202
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,330
that's kind of an area for future

203
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:11,320
research to explore why and then also

204
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:14,169
they had different sources of advice so

205
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,120
the workplace was far more often a

206
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,060
source of advice for these participants

207
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,650
than it was for general participants so

208
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,930
it's also possible that they're getting

209
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,690
maybe better advice from their workplace

210
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,639
that's telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to use two-factor</font>

211
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,580
and so therefore they're going to be a

212
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,130
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more secure and then finally they</font>

213
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,490
also felt that digital security advice

214
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,250
was more useful than the general

215
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,650
participants did so general participants

216
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,440
tended to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was equally useful as</font>

217
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,990
physical or physical is more useful but

218
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,610
the security sensitive thought

219
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,880
digital security advice is more useful

220
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah and then finally we wanted to talk</font>

221
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,529
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative security experiences so</font>

222
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,930
prior work has emphasized the importance

223
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,029
of negative security experiences or

224
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,910
stories of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those experiences in teaching</font>

225
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:08,800
new behaviors and so we chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask our</font>

226
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,829
participants whether they'd ever had a

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,290
negative experience and so what we found

228
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,180
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an addition to you know echoing</font>

229
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">prior work that these experiences are</font>

230
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,319
important and all but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

231
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">participants cited learning from a</font>

232
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,760
negative experience we also heard that

233
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,189
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> did the experience didn't have to</font>

234
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,560
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to them and it didn't</font>

235
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,540
have to be the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a friend people</font>

236
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,880
were citing these experiences coming out

237
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,939
of TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows and they were saying things</font>

238
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,000
like I put a password on my Wi-Fi

239
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,339
network after<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching a TV show it</font>

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,339
showed people going by<font color="#E5E5E5"> houses and Wi-Fi</font>

241
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:48,250
snooping shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that they make you</font>

242
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,080
think and so we heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a couple of</font>

243
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,089
participants this sort of strong memory

244
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,510
of making a distinct behavior change

245
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,790
based on a television show and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

246
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,459
leads to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first design recommendation</font>

247
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,290
which is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want users to go</font>

248
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:03,699
through these negative experiences and

249
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,610
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want their friends have to go</font>

250
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,450
through them to tell them stories so can

251
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take fictional</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vinny's to simulate</font>

252
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,279
these negative experiences can we create

253
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,399
short commercials or other types of

254
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,959
stories to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same teaching impact</font>

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,660
than a negative security experience

256
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">might and so that's an area you know for</font>

257
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,630
future development at work then also as

258
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,370
we mentioned marketing material and the

259
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,279
advice made users much more likely to

260
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,020
reject it and so it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

261
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,970
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where marketing messaging is</font>

262
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,020
occurring in security advice and try to

263
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,670
avoid the perception of marketing and

264
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,980
then also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we looked at the</font>

265
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitivity and we</font>

266
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,360
saw some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> trends there but as</font>

267
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,950
this is qualitative we don't know the

268
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,490
prevalence of those trends so that's

269
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,350
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> an area for future work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with regard</font>

270
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,750
to two-factor authentication and the

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,240
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns that you</font>

272
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's brought up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's again important to</font>

273
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,100
explore how prevalent that is and if

274
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,020
it's shown to be equally as prevalent to

275
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,380
look at how we can reassure users about

276
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,750
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in security behaviors and</font>

277
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,060
then finally we found although not

278
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned here that primary sources of</font>

281
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,089
overloading users with more and more

282
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,530
advice for more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more places we</font>

283
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,030
should try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pare down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

284
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:31,589
giving them and send it through

285
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:33,390
pre-existing channels so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary we</font>

286
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,970
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out where users got</font>

287

advice why they took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we can</font>

288
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,050
make it better we conducted a

289
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,440
semi-structured interview with 25

290
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,569
participants and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that trust</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

291
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,570
source was a key metric for digital

292
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,520
security but not physical that advice is

293
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,440
getting rejected not just because it's

294
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,600
inconvenient or users think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

295
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,400
at risk but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because it contains</font>

marketing material or threatens their

321
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:16,660
the wrong thing to do um physical

322
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,610
security to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess would have some</font>

323
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,520
evolutionary benefit that might be

324
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,230
hooked in which right makes it a little

325
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,710
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more intuitive have you thought</font>

326
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">about comparing not digital security to</font>

327
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:33,330
physical security but some other

328
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:36,579
physical task that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also maybe not so</font>

329
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,790
refined in some sort of like animal way

330
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,040
like how to fix a car or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

331
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,140
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit after we</font>

332
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,079
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this about maybe comparing</font>

333
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,699
to like health<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know eating</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to do but you should do maybe that</font>

336
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,700
comparison or fixing it car we haven't

337
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,600
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a good idea</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting work so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say a</font>

341
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit about this tech marketing</font>

342
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,570
that adversely impact the people's this

343
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">I guess I'm not taking this advice so a</font>

344
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,970
while ago one company had at is a

345
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,250
campaign like marketing campaign that

346
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">says we are much better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than the other</font>

347
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,520
competitor and on privacy so there are

348
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of so it was not TV yet but there's</font>

349
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,069
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of online ad in YouTube ads and</font>

350
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,480
then I heard that later that so they

351
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,600
were also collecting data about how

352
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,180
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were signing more petition for</font>

353
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,000
like you know asking this company not to

354
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,209
use my email content for advertising and

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,180
so on and I saw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the ads</font>

356
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,400
really worked so I was a little

357
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,810
surprised to hear that and as some

358
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,020
people did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take this advice</font>

359
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,790
from you know professionally created

360
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,939
marketing campaign yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

361
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,160
was sort of an important distinction is

362
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,160
that was that people were interested in

363
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,800
the authority of the advice so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a</font>

364
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,839
researcher<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Google was giving advice</font>

365
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,880
they didn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as marketing</font>

366
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,710
material I think marketing came about

367
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,530
when it was like they felt like they

368
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,350
were being pressured into using a tool

369
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,810
or pressured into paying for a tool or

370
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,060
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about paying for a tool within</font>

371
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">general security advice so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

372
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's sort of something we'd want to</font>

373
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,360
look at is like what exact type of

374
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,910
marketing really bothers them<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

375
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus seems authoritative from a</font>

376
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:45,650
company yeah yes I had a quick follow-up

377
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,660
to that did you separate between kind of

378
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">online services people were using that</font>

379
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,250
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them advice and their operating</font>

380
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,160
system or mobile operating system giving

381
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,740
them advice when they're setting up yeah

382
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,760
so we did code for like prompts or

383
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,550
automatic

384
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,470
yes did did you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> any I mean note</font>

385
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,780
was a small group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to notice</font>

386
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,060
any trend between mac and windows or

387
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,520
android and iOS yeah we know this

388
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:14,089
definitely a trend of oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a mac</font>

389
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore I don't need to do XYZ I</font>

390
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,820
also heard that from linux users who

391
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,310
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> security professionals which I was</font>

a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> like shaking out but so we did</font>

394
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,900
discernible trends as to like what

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that</font>
