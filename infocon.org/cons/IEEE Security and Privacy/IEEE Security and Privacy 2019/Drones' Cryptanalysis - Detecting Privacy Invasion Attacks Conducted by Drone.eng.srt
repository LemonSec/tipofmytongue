1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:16,309
okay so hello I'm Ben I'm a PhD student

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,250
from ben-gurion University I'm here to

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,349
present drone script analysis a joint

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,540
work made with the help of husband at an

5
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:25,610
El profesor additional mill and

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:31,220
professor LaValle all of which my PhD

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:33,950
adviser so let's start and I want you to

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,019
have a look on this picture now can you

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,120
please tell me what is the drone that is

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,610
being boxed in yellow is being used for

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,099
is it being used for conducting the

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,960
privacy invasion attack or is it being

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:54,470
used for a legitimate purpose in this

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:57,910
case is taking a selfie is it B R C so

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:02,079
the answer is actually D it depends and

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:05,539
this is a real problem nowadays because

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,360
many operators now use drones to spy

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,939
after their spouses after their

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,930
neighbors after celebrities and even

20
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:18,229
after random people and this challenge

21
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:21,409
is even expected to get worse in the

22
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,420
near future because many businesses

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,700
around the world now adopt drones for

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,229
various purposes deliveries is only one

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,700
of them moreover legislation and

26
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,620
regulations are being changed in order

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,159
to support what we call an open skies

28
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:43,909
policy allowing drones to fly in

29
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:46,130
populated areas ok so we went to the

30
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:50,600
literature in order to check what is

31
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,970
what was suggested in order to detect a

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,979
privacy invasion attack and we actually

33
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,920
found that there are various geofencing

34
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,920
methods that were suggested over the

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,260
past few years such as radars and

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,770
cameras and even some hybrid methods and

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:11,120
these methods are able to detect the

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,470
presence of a nearby drone however let

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,269
me ask you the following question is

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,639
detecting the presence of a nearby

41
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:19,609
ground actually effective at detecting a

42
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,430
privacy invasion attack and the answer

43
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:24,620
is no because as I said earlier

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,830
the present is no longer restricted in

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,200
populated areas also even if you manage

46
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,209
to detect the drone does it necessarily

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,010
means that the drone is being used to

48
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,659
spy after the organization as you can

49
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,269
see in here

50
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:40,328
this two picture actually were taken

51
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,920
from the same location of the drone that

52
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:46,250
is being located that is being boxed in

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,170
yellow so the drones location doesn't

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,870
necessarily implies that the drone is

55
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,540
being used to spy after the victim after

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,370
a point of interest it's actually the

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,200
camera orientation that determines

58
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,299
whether it is being used for a

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,599
legitimate purpose or not so we actually

60
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,909
concluded that geofencing methods are

61
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:11,709
irrelevant for detecting a privacy

62
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:14,720
invasion attack in an open skies era

63
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:19,209
okay so our main objective is actually

64
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,310
detecting a privacy invasion attack and

65
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:23,599
let's go through the detection scheme we

66
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,840
actually assume that there is a malysh

67
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:31,578
malicious drone operator that operates a

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,410
Wi-Fi fpv drone and you use the drone to

69
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,959
spy after a victim that can be located

70
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,750
up to five kilometers from the malicious

71
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:43,030
drone operator now we assume that we

72
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:46,190
managed to using a radio receiver to

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,190
intercept the packets that are being

74
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:53,120
sent from the drone back to its

75
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:56,000
malicious operator and we also assume

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,949
that the victim is using some kind of a

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,349
gadget we don't name it watermark al and

78
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,900
I will explain what what what a market

79
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:10,548
is actually being useful in two or three

80
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:13,849
slides from now so for now let's talk

81
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,579
about Wi-Fi first-person view Channel

82
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:20,719
and Wi-Fi fpv channel actually intended

83
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:24,580
to provide two things one is to sling

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:28,070
the video stream for from the drone to

85
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,330
its operator and the second one is

86
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,760
actually to allow the operator to

87
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,440
maneuver the dome while it's up it's in

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,120
air in this study we actually

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,840
focus on the downlink which is the video

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:45,440
stream and when you are using Wi-Fi for

91
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,010
a Wi-Fi for a first-person view channel

92
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,790
you actually get the encryption only

93
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,520
just by using the Wi-Fi standout so you

94
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,080
get the encryption for free so it means

95
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,780
that the video stream is encrypted

96
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,260
however that's encryption ensures

97
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,359
confidentiality so again the answer is

98
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,409
no I wasn't here if the answer was yes

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:16,250
and let us talk about how first to

100
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:18,380
intercept an F PBS stream and most

101
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,370
specifically how we can intercept a

102
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,450
Wi-Fi network so we actually apply the

103
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:31,160
three stages we sniff Wi-Fi packets sent

104
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:34,219
from of a specific network you can do it

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,440
using applications such as l1 we're

106
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,750
extracting the time series signal from

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,419
the unencrypted metadata in the second

108
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,900
layer now indeed the payload is

109
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:47,919
encrypted however the metadata that we

110
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,810
are using is not encrypted which is the

111
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,760
the size of the packet now we use it in

112
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,730
order to extract the time series and we

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,849
done sample the the time series by

114
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,470
aggregating the time series in in a

115
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:06,860
fixed window it's actually makes me more

116
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:10,970
more faster so let us now talk how you

117
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,880
can classify a Wi-Fi network as fpv

118
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,110
channels so the key observation in here

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,360
is to understand that the Dome is

120
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,450
basically a flying camera now by

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,640
combining these tops of this algorithms

122
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,590
for moving device detection with

123
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,800
algorithms to come at a detection you

124
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,080
can actually classify a Wi-Fi network as

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:36,680
fpv channel and the way that we do it is

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:38,330
actually we managed to find that if you

127
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,500
take the intercept the bitrate signal

128
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,409
and analyze it

129
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,990
in the frequency domain the most

130
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,990
strongest magnitude actually corresponds

131
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,750
to the FPS rate so as you can see in

132
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,760
here

133
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,490
this was actually taken from one of the

134
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,289
dolls that we used and this will help

135
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,550
you actually to detect not only drones

136
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:05,810
but also cameras so how you can exclude

137
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,150
the cameras from the drones really are

138
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,120
using algorithms for moving object

139
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,140
detection this can easily be done by

140
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,370
analyzing the received signal and

141
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:19,490
vindication that is also present in the

142
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,960
in the Wi-Fi packet and combining these

143
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,830
two observation to a single algorithm

144
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,500
you be able to detect a drone within

145
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:33,200
three seconds with high accuracy and

146
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:35,360
very low a false positive rate okay so

147
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,430
after you manage to detect the flame per

148
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,860
second rate you actually get something

149
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,890
else for free which is the resolution

150
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,840
that is being video streamed that is the

151
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,440
that is being used for the video stream

152
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,690
and this is actually being done only by

153
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,490
dividing the the bits per second with

154
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,900
the frame per second you get the

155
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,520
resolution there are many calculators

156
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,359
online that can actually solve it to you

157
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,919
[Music]

158
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,630
okay so now let's move to the more

159
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,780
interesting part on how to detect

160
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,640
actually whether the fpd stream that you

161
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,109
classified is being used to videos to

162
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,300
him the victim to spy on a victim and in

163
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,360
order to do so i want you to have a look

164
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,220
on the third stage of the downlink which

165
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,420
is the video encoding the video

166
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,150
compression now this stage actually

167
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,710
follows the h.264 standards now for

168
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,120
those of you who are not familiar with

169
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,860
h.264 compression standards basically i

170
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,010
will summarize it in this way instead of

171
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,200
sending an entire frame a frame is

172
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,439
actually described as delta frames as

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,930
delta changes from another frame and

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,870
this information is being sent in this

175
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:50,479
structure a group of pictures structure

176
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,080
GOP structure so the result of using

177
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,930
this video compression algorithm is

178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,360
basically if there are two consecutive

179
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:03,420
frames with high similarity

180
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,060
means that lower amount of data needs to

181
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,010
be encoded and sent to the drone however

182
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,209
if there is a big similarity between two

183
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,910
consecutive frames actually a bigger

184
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,399
amount of data needs to be encoded and

185
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,420
sent back to the to the drones operator

186
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,980
from the drone and having that in mind

187
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,569
we actually place the drone as you can

188
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,120
see in here in front of an LED board

189
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,970
this is the LED board was connected to

190
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:38,640
an Arduino and we actually used the LED

191
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,410
board as flicker we actually turn it to

192
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,750
a flea helps flicker as you can see in

193
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,880
here and intercepted the traffic that

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,500
was sent from the drone to the

195
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,390
controller now as you can see this is

196
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,950
the intercepted bit light signal over

197
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:58,769
time and it actually contains six

198
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,839
beautiful bursts every time that the

199
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:05,370
flicker changed from on to off and vice

200
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,510
versa so you can we actually concluded

201
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,149
that the flea Health's flickering LED

202
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,760
actually watermarks the six created the

203
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:18,570
six health phenomena in the intercepted

204
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,670
battery signal so understanding this we

205
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,829
actually managed to watermark each and

206
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,930
every frequency of the intercepted bit

207
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:29,370
light signal and by doing so you can

208
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:32,180
analyze the influence of how the

209
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,529
magnitude was changed as a result of

210
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,170
initiating a flicker in a given time and

211
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:39,570
by doing so you can decide whether you

212
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,990
can determine whether a drone is being

213
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:46,170
directed to a flicker now if the flicker

214
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,930
is actually located nearby the victim it

215
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,420
means that you can imply that the drone

216
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:57,899
is actually being used to spy after the

217
00:10:51,420 --> 00:11:00,449
victim okay so for now you understand

218
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,740
how to classify a suspicious radio

219
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:05,910
transmission as fpv Channel and how to

220
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,910
detect whether the fpv channel is

221
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,689
actually being used to spy after the

222
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,769
victim however with a big sorrow great

223
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,389
sorrow I can

224
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:19,439
I won't be able to explain you how to

225
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:22,920
locate the drone in space by analyzing

226
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:24,779
the intercepted bitrate signal I didn't

227
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,998
manage to squeeze it into a 16 minute

228
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,920
stalk so the details are on the paper

229
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,689
you are invited to read it you will

230
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,368
invite it to estimate in the question

231
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:40,079
episode afterwards ok so we have a

232
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:42,839
flicker and we want to hide it from the

233
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,819
drones operator in order to not raise

234
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,209
this suspicion that something is

235
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:52,139
happening and we actually analyze

236
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:56,849
several ways in order to achieve it

237
00:11:52,139 --> 00:12:00,029
however the way that we find as most

238
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,910
effective was flickering between two

239
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,529
similar use instead of just turning it

240
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,179
on and off flicker in between two

241
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,860
similarly news that their only

242
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,980
difference is actually in the brightness

243
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,970
component and this actually satisfies

244
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:17,249
the following requirements it's actually

245
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,970
exploits the inability of the human eye

246
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:23,819
to distinguish between two similar use

247
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,369
it's also so it means undetectable by

248
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:29,009
direct observation it means that if the

249
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:32,220
operator will look at the flicker you

250
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:34,769
won't be able to detect it it also it's

251
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,889
undetectable by indirect observation it

252
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:39,209
means that even if you will look on it

253
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,579
via the controller you want to be able

254
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:47,429
to detect it and as you can see in here

255
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:58,319
it does watermarks the intercepted fpv

256
00:12:47,429 --> 00:13:02,790
channel okay so I want to show you we

257
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:05,040
wanted to test our method in real

258
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:09,179
scenarios and in order to do it we

259
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,929
actually applied it to a victim that is

260
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,230
on the move

261
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:15,660
actually driving in a car and a static

262
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,669
victim that is actually located in its

263
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:24,689
living room and let me show you the

264
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:27,209
demos here you can see a siren that is

265
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:29,550
actually flickering in

266
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:33,089
specific frequency I think it's three

267
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:37,498
point three point nine Hertz and the

268
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:39,749
victim is inside the car and here we

269
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:41,249
used a smart film as a flicker as you

270
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:44,189
can see the flickering window it is

271
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:49,589
installed on the window we use it as a

272
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:53,099
flicker now for each of these scenarios

273
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:58,649
we also recorded a legitimate use of the

274
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:02,220
drone and we did it by locating the

275
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,199
drone 180 degrees from the from the

276
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,999
house and from the car we call it a

277
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:10,889
legitimate use now we wanted to evaluate

278
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:13,259
at our method on on the intercepted bit

279
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:17,220
light signal in each of the cases and we

280
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:19,619
fixed the to positive way to 1.1 1.0 it

281
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,259
means that all the privacy invasion

282
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:24,629
attacks should be detected and as you

283
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,170
can see inhale in about two-and-a-half

284
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:31,170
seconds we were able to detect privacy

285
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,868
invasion attack with very low false

286
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:39,029
positive rate this is how the

287
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:45,990
spectrograms looked like when the

288
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:50,429
flicker was on okay something I'm about

289
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,990
to I'm about to get to the end so some

290
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,629
additional information that can be found

291
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,449
in the paper you will be able to find

292
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:59,759
the exact details on how to locate how

293
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,889
to locate the spine grown in space just

294
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,559
by analyzing the intercepted bitrate

295
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:11,549
signal and we do it with only a single

296
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:14,009
Wi-Fi receiver you will be able to read

297
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:17,429
about the countermeasure methods about

298
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:20,910
the analysis of the impact of ambient

299
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:23,879
factors which are wind and ambient light

300
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,069
and other methods that we considered for

301
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,799
hiding the flicker and the exact details

302
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:30,439
of the experiments that I described in

303
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,209
this talk

304
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:37,290
the preliminary version of this paper

305
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:39,839
which actually presents a method on how

306
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,280
to detect a privacy invasion attack

307
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,990
using

308
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,180
time domain analysis instead of

309
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,650
frequency analysis as I described in

310
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,689
Hill is on the Alki we named it back

311
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,350
then a year and a half ago game of

312
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,880
drones in order to get some good PR

313
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,370
however considering the latest course of

314
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,930
events I might have to change the name

315
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:07,250
of game of drones in order to maintain

316
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:08,989
some good PR ok so I want you to on

317
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,000
behalf of a cyber let BG you I'd like to

318
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,180
thank you all for attending this talk

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,430
you can find us just by looking cyber at

320
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,349
bgu this is my twitter account you can

321
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,650
find more of our works in there and this

322
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,750
is the paper website and i think that

323
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:32,750
this is about the time to take questions

324
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:34,960
thank you so again we have time for few

325
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:42,560
questions

326
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:44,540
can you please go to the mic hi I'm

327
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,829
Chris from UCSB a couple of questions

328
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,709
you said the Flickr would not be visible

329
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:52,070
but it showed in the videos what's up no

330
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:55,610
in the videos we didn't we didn't intend

331
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:59,690
to to hide it but there's a video in the

332
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,460
picture and it shows how you can hide we

333
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,100
actually figure with the smart bulb

334
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,839
between two similar use and it's not

335
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,149
detected to the human eye so you can

336
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,329
find it by the way there are photos in

337
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,430
the paper that show you the how the use

338
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,589
are similar and you won't be able to

339
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,170
understand that there are that there is

340
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,250
a difference between them okay cool and

341
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,050
the second one is when you set the

342
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,959
experiments or the false positives the

343
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:26,750
drone was facing like exactly away from

344
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,370
from yeah 180 degrees for the other side

345
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,230
so what about the scenario that you

346
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,750
described were you actually were spying

347
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,460
on the room and the drone was like the

348
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,620
legitimate use was it was looking down

349
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,630
right no maybe it had some reflection

350
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,899
from walls that it would pick up ah

351
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,980
regarding the reflection so basically

352
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,690
when you are looking at the room we use

353
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,240
the smart film this is not even a

354
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,720
flicker which

355
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,510
creates light so there is no in this

356
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,750
case there there is no chance that to

357
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:02,290
get reflections from a smart film

358
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:05,140
however in all of our experiments using

359
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:10,060
an LED we did not get any you know false

360
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:16,210
positive as a result of the reflections

361
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:18,340
that were somehow yes yeah interesting

362
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,160
work so I was wondering on the

363
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,080
robustness of the of the approach and in

364
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,390
particular Hawaii did you change from

365
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,280
timing base to frequency based analysis

366
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,320
and I was wondering if it was based on

367
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,720
the on the like the false positives that

368
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,370
you might be able to get because at

369
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,280
least in timing analysis I would I would

370
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:40,570
expect that unless the scene is very

371
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,580
steel like if the drone has is like

372
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,220
looking at a street that has a lot of

373
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,449
people moving across then the timing and

374
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,370
I'll here is probably going to be very

375
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,250
similar to the flicker analysis now in

376
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:54,639
there because it's yeah basically you

377
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,950
ask and give that proper answer when you

378
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,020
are using time domain analysis there is

379
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,030
a larger kind of false positive light as

380
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,389
a result of some other things that

381
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:09,940
happening during the time that you are

382
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:12,700
trying to apply the flicker link so when

383
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,440
you are using frequency domain analysis

384
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,110
things are getting more neater and

385
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,330
cleaner because you can exactly look for

386
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,709
the frequency that you want in order to

387
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:25,929
understand whether privacy invasion

388
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,850
attack is actually conducted so it makes

389
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,850
things more clearer and as you can see

390
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:34,870
in the as I showed you in the experiment

391
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,179
of the car the extent of the car I don't

392
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,169
believe that can be detected using time

393
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,310
domain analysis there is too much noise

394
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,590
my point yeah okay

395
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,030
there was also been some work on trying

396
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,909
to sort of like you see visuals

397
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,770
challenges to identify or example if

398
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,140
they if the camera is looking at the

399
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,990
right place but it was it was a

400
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,490
different kind of scenario was on

401
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,590
authenticating the image like sort of

402
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,910
like verifying that I'm indeed looking

403
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,929
at at one area and not

404
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,180
sort of like the typical Hollywood

405
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,920
attack where the attacker is replaying

406
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,110
the old video from yesterday and it's

407
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,560
not there so it might be worth to take a

408
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,679
look

409
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,090
thanks thank you okay so let's think

410
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,410
been again thank you very much

411
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,409
[Applause]
