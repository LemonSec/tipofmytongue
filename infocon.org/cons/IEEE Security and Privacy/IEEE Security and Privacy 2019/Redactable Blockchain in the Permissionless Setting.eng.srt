1
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,719
so

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm sorry

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,820
hanging over people deductible block

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,810
less setting all right so let me jump

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,990
directly into

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,779
blockchains in a minute so you may know

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,259
blockchain is a infrastructure where

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,060
users can upload data and it's

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,880
maintained in a distributed manner and

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,100
the properties of a blockchain ensure

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,580
that the data that's uploaded has some

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,870
sense of public reliability and

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,239
immutability in the sense that it cannot

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:48,010
be modified or edited or removed in a

15
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:50,919
later time all right so what kind of

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,670
data can this be it can range from a

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,820
normal payment from a user to another

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,550
user or multimedia files or complicated

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,250
contracts as we saw before as if you saw

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,679
in the previous talk so it can range

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,710
from these and it can also be quite

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,130
arbitrary and objectionable content that

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,610
can be inserted which can make the data

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,759
that gets inserted into the block to be

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:22,750
sometimes harmful all right so why is

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,720
this a problem so let's take the case

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,750
where some jurisdictions around the

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,910
world are fine for full nodes for

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,760
running a blockchain that has some

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,720
harmful data in it while some others are

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,940
clearly not and this could mean bad for

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,940
the full nodes that are there in the

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,720
jurisdiction I mean it can it harms the

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:50,410
adaptability of the blockchain itself

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,660
and for a law enforcement agencies this

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,220
clearly is a problem the immutability of

37
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,649
harmful content that gets into the

38
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,550
blockchain is clearly a problem and it's

39
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:03,370
been discussed for quite some time now

40
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,630
all right so here's where we propose our

41
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,150
solution

42
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,220
ours is a deductible blockchain where we

43
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,090
don't do not make any additional trust

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,760
assumptions and we redact content after

45
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,400
a certain number of miners agree on what

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,790
needs to be redacted its publicly

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,800
verifiable and accountable and it's

48
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,469
agnostic to what kind of underlying

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,150
consensus mechanism you use if it's

50
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:29,109
proof of work proof of stake we don't

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,450
mind

52
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,120
and we do not make use of any heavy

53
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,299
cryptographic machinery so this is quite

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,880
practical and later in the talk I will

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,790
show you how this can be integrated into

56
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,230
a system like Bitcoin currently all

57
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,120
right so why don't simple solutions

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,820
straightforward solutions why don't they

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,640
work well if you have the data that

60
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,220
inserted in one of the recent blocks in

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,010
the chain it's always possible to create

62
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,130
an alternate history and you know kind

63
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,420
of fork evade the harmful content and

64
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,060
such that no one needs to store a

65
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,980
broadcast or anything all right but what

66
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,700
if the data is deeply embedded in the

67
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,890
chain and to do a fork it's almost like

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,769
doing a hard fork and it can be quite

69
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,708
quite a lot of hard work on part of the

70
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:24,450
miners to do this all right

71
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:28,840
what if miners in the network decide to

72
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,670
locally drop the data you know just they

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,940
have some informal discussions and they

74
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,880
just drop the data well what happens

75
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,959
because of this is that the verifying

76
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,030
the hash links on the blocks where the

77
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,650
data is dropped becomes a problem now

78
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,690
because you don't have the complete data

79
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,510
to verify the block and the link to the

80
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,549
next block and so on well these miners

81
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,890
could very well say that okay we know

82
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,230
where the data was dropped you know what

83
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,029
was dropped so probably we can help new

84
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,670
users who join the network we can

85
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,440
clearly tell them what's happening well

86
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,480
let's consider a scenario a new user

87
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,090
joins the network and he asks for a

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,100
version of the chain and a harness user

89
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,019
would would do this would give the

90
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,049
redacted chain which was locally trapped

91
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,660
alright and explain why there the links

92
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,630
there cannot be verified well if there's

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,330
an adversary he could arbitrarily choose

94
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,550
a block in the middle and drop a data

95
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,789
and you know say that oh this this was

96
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,100
the one that we agreed on and if you

97
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,350
think about it a new user could

98
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,960
potentially have many many more versions

99
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,000
where he cannot make out I mean he

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,140
cannot verify the links so he cannot

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,960
make out which is the correct

102
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,089
agreed-upon chain anymore

103
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,248
well how could you get over this what if

104
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:49,759
you have a trusted Authority in place

105
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:51,740
and you new user takes this chain that

106
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,449
you received from someone takes it to

107
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,210
the trusted Authority and he says like

108
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:58,460
this is the correct one and probably the

109
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,558
authority says yeah this is the one they

110
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,539
decided to drop it here and you can

111
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:05,539
accept this all right and then of course

112
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:08,860
the new user trusts the authority and he

113
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:13,009
takes this chain as the current version

114
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,309
so solutions that are similar in spirit

115
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:21,289
were proposed by attending ESA and euro

116
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:26,479
and PD in 2017 and dialer at all NDS s

117
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:27,860
this year so they they involve a trusted

118
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,029
set of committee it's a permission

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,610
setting and it involves some large-scale

120
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:37,520
MPC across all the minors and they make

121
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:41,990
use of what is a chameleon hash to kind

122
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,240
of repair the very you know the broken

123
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,930
link so that it's verifiable now all

124
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,969
right well what are the key challenges

125
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,149
for a permissionless setting like

126
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:56,629
Bitcoin right there are no trusted

127
00:05:53,149 --> 00:06:01,129
committee here it's a you know a free

128
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:03,110
peer-to-peer network right and how do

129
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,779
you how do people in the network agree

130
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,580
on what's trapped and what's not dropped

131
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,289
what's harmful what's not harmful so you

132
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,139
need to have an agreement or a consensus

133
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:15,589
on this and it needs to be publicly

134
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,749
verifiable and accountable as to what

135
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:21,680
where and when some harmful data was

136
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:25,099
dropped and of course it needs to be

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,959
practical a large-scale MPC could be

138
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:30,709
could prove prohibitive in this manner

139
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,449
and there are no solutions known yet for

140
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:36,589
a permissionless setting like Bitcoin

141
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:39,620
right and here here is our protocol that

142
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:42,469
we aim to achieve be aimed to solve all

143
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,509
of those challenges in a simple and easy

144
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:49,339
to understand able way all right

145
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:51,110
so let me describe our protocol now we

146
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,719
first need some a little bit of

147
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,299
formalism so we we call what is a

148
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,919
reduct policy with the miners the

149
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:01,909
network need to agree on this policy

150
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,919
that basically says under what condition

151
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:08,219
and under what level of agreement as

152
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,159
data can can a data be redacted so for

153
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:13,579
example it could be some fifty fifty one

154
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:16,949
percent of the miners need to agree on a

155
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,589
redact request and that particular data

156
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,929
can be redacted you know all right so

157
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:25,139
what about the properties our protocol

158
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:31,529
does not affect chain growth because we

159
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:34,159
do not remove blocks and so we do not

160
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:37,110
affect the growth of the chain over time

161
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:40,019
chain quality is preserved with respect

162
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,409
to the policy as long as the number of

163
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,419
votes required for a reduction is more

164
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:48,839
than the adversity will bound on the

165
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,849
network all right and of course we do

166
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,949
not have common prefix because we are

167
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,839
going back in time and changing stuff

168
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:58,099
but we do have what is called an

169
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,629
editable common prefix which needs to

170
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,279
comply with the policy of the network so

171
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,009
if a policy approves a particular

172
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,989
reduction then harness players in the

173
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,239
network are guaranteed to have the power

174
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:11,638
same prefix all right

175
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:14,248
so how does our protocol work so this is

176
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,989
the blockchain that we have currently so

177
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,179
we need to modify the block header

178
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:20,459
structure in a way that instead of one

179
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:22,649
link now you have two links between

180
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,110
blocks alright so for ease of

181
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,879
convenience we call the first one to be

182
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,179
an old link and the second one to be a

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,729
new link all right and how do you

184
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:36,478
request for a reduction any user in the

185
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,490
network can can ask for a particular

186
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,649
data to be redacted so he needs to make

187
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,730
this request so he does this by first

188
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:48,120
constructing at what is called a

189
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,160
candidate block which he wants it to

190
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,589
replace the original block and he

191
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,129
publishes the hash of this block onto

192
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:58,230
the chain and sends this candidate block

193
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:03,750
into what is to call this candidate pool

194
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,730
of candidates all right so now miners

195
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,590
can deliberate on

196
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,380
the candidate blocks so they retrieve

197
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,630
this from the poo and they can decide to

198
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,680
you know what for this candidate block

199
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,900
or not right so how do they do this what

200
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,520
they remember that the hash of the

201
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,610
candidate block is on the chain so the

202
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,730
miners have access to this so they take

203
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,860
this hash and if they decide to vote or

204
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,870
not what they included into the mind

205
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,330
block so here the green user obviously

206
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,130
does not want to work so he minds the

207
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,710
block without the word for the candidate

208
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,180
block but some of the users may want to

209
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,250
so they include the hash of the

210
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,339
candidate block into their newly mind

211
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,040
block so this goes on alright so once

212
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,350
the wording face is done now you need to

213
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,170
decide if this candidate block was

214
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,410
indeed approved or not right so what you

215
00:09:52,170 --> 00:10:00,420
do is you take this voting period which

216
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:02,280
is predetermined and you see if the

217
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,569
number of votes received for a candidate

218
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:11,100
block is compliant for the chains redact

219
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:13,850
policy so for example in Bitcoin terms

220
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,470
you can have two week voting period and

221
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,620
51% of the blocks mined in this two

222
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,600
weeks need to work for a particular

223
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,540
redact request and then the policy

224
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,870
approves this request that's what we

225
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,310
have all right so okay let's say that in

226
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,530
this case the candidate block was

227
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,380
approved by the policy all right so now

228
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,240
what happens now you go to the chain and

229
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,350
you replace the original block with this

230
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:44,730
candidate block okay but notice that

231
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:46,980
once that is done here the old link

232
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,130
stays good but the the new link is

233
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,170
broken okay our blocks structure

234
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,439
modification ensures this this happens

235
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:58,589
all right okay so how do you now

236
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,610
validate a redacted block chain so for a

237
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:04,110
normal block you you verify the content

238
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,550
that you verify for the proof of worth

239
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,610
or proof of stake is correctly solved

240
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,349
you verify you validate the data that's

241
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,200
inserted into the block according to

242
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,930
some predetermined validation rule and

243
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,889
you check if the hatchlings are good you

244
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,469
check if the old link and the new link

245
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:24,009
good this is for a non redacted normal

246
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,869
block so for a redacted block you check

247
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:29,559
the same proof of work proof of steak

248
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:31,149
but with respect to the old link and you

249
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,519
don't you do not consider the new link

250
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,069
anymore and you check the validity of

251
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,549
the contents in the block and you check

252
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:41,799
if the new link is broken while the old

253
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:43,959
link is good and of course you need to

254
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:47,230
check if the if the redacted block was

255
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:51,189
indeed approved by the policy okay

256
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:54,040
simple validation rules all right so how

257
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:59,169
do you how does this reflect on Bitcoin

258
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:03,189
so in Bitcoin some data points can be

259
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:05,230
inserted via transactions and most most

260
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,899
probably they find place in this

261
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,619
operatin are in the coinbase transaction

262
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:13,179
of the miner who Minds the block and

263
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:15,459
there are works that show that there are

264
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:17,108
some illicit and harmful contents that

265
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:22,899
are existing in the current a Bitcoin

266
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:25,660
blockchain alright so so how would the

267
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:28,410
block modify the the block header gets

268
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,699
modified here so this is the original

269
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,368
the current block header and the block

270
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,508
contents so what you do is you have an

271
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:37,529
additional field here

272
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:39,489
that's the numerical route and I mean

273
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:44,079
additional to the old Merkel route

274
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:46,629
that's a new entry and now as I said you

275
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,549
have two links so the old link is

276
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,350
completely determined by the old merkel

277
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,239
routes and it does not take into account

278
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,389
the numerical route while the new link

279
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:58,199
takes the old and the new one okay but

280
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:02,019
when you originally newly miner block

281
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,339
both these links are the same okay both

282
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,379
lane what these links are the same

283
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,600
meaning that the old merkel route is

284
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:11,049
equal to the numerator road this is the

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,929
originally mind block alright so how

286
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:15,819
does a candidate block look like for a

287
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,619
candidate block let's say that the

288
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:21,279
transaction two apparently has some

289
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:23,470
harmful content in it you propose a

290
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,439
candidate transaction T x2 star to

291
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,339
replace this transaction and obviously

292
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,259
you can see that the new

293
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,730
rude now that's included in the

294
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,279
candidate Bluff is different from the

295
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,499
old Merkel route here okay

296
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:39,980
notice that this our protocol allows

297
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:43,279
transaction level reductions not just

298
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,009
block level reductions alright so how

299
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,540
does deliberation going take place

300
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:53,540
people verify if tx2 star does not alter

301
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,819
any monetary information after

302
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,370
transaction that was originally in TX -

303
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:59,748
all right that's important you cannot

304
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,319
change addresses you cannot change the

305
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:04,670
amounts in a transaction and so on and

306
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:06,410
toward for this candidate block the word

307
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,920
is included in the kind base transaction

308
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,870
by the miner who Minds the block and how

309
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,719
do you validate this apart from checking

310
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,629
the links and the policy approval you

311
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,670
check if the merkel routes are computed

312
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,860
correctly so the old merkel route can be

313
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,569
come with a verified against the old set

314
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,839
of transactions and a new one with TX

315
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:31,399
two-star replaced here and you check the

316
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,559
proof of work with respect to the old

317
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,179
merkel route alone and not with respect

318
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,969
to the new merkel route because that

319
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,769
won't verify anymore but you can still

320
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,309
check the proof of work with respect to

321
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:47,800
the old state that you have stored

322
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:51,290
alright so let me kind of conclude our

323
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,540
contribution here so we have a public

324
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,248
verification here so you clearly know

325
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,920
who is requesting for a reduction and

326
00:14:55,249 --> 00:15:00,889
who is voting for it and when this is

327
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,110
happening all on chain public and you

328
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,089
have a count ability meaning that in the

329
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,149
in the wording phase you clearly know if

330
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,699
the miners are kind of going and waiting

331
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:13,279
for a blocker they are not voting for a

332
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:14,508
block in Bitcoin it's you can clearly

333
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,439
see if they are voting for a redact

334
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:22,189
transaction or not all right and after a

335
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:24,620
particular reduction happens it's not

336
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:26,329
possible for someone you know to claim

337
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,689
wrongly that his transaction was

338
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:32,179
redacted and you know claimed falsely a

339
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:34,459
false victimhood as we call it all right

340
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:36,410
and we made no additional trust

341
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:39,439
assumption apart from what is required

342
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,790
for the underlying consensus mechanism

343
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,560
to

344
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:49,930
and our reductions are policy compliant

345
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:52,150
and the the policy is in charge that the

346
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,520
miners in the network kind of agree on

347
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,030
what's redacted and what's not okay so

348
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:03,310
there is no trust or authority anymore

349
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:08,290
okay and then we did a proof of concept

350
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:11,589
implementation and we found that the

351
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:14,400
validation of a redacted blockchain that

352
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,550
has up to five thousand blocks redacted

353
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,640
takes up to three percent in terms of

354
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,839
validation time overhead compared to a

355
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:27,850
normal unredacted blockchain and many

356
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,320
many more optimizations in this regard

357
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,910
are possible because you can cache the

358
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,100
word you can have concurrent voting for

359
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:37,390
many redact requests and so on and so

360
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:41,750
forth all right so thanks for listening

361
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:45,210
to the talk and it's open for questions

362
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,210
[Applause]

363
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,390
thank you very much

364
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:54,520
questions hi thanks to the interesting

365
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,949
talk that's for interesting work I have

366
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,310
one questions so you said in the system

367
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,660
that you build your protocol and I think

368
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,659
you won't be able to have payment rail

369
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,359
networks because don't you have the

370
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,060
danger that I if you want to close the

371
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,490
channel I publish an old state and some

372
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,379
bribe and that I can convince the miners

373
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,290
who don't know if the state is valid or

374
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,290
not to actually redact it and you won't

375
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:23,649
be able to do anything against it yeah

376
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,079
so I think the the problem the same

377
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,910
problem could arise with a normal

378
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,680
payment transaction you know if I mean

379
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,840
you could bribe a miner to suppress a

380
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,960
particular payment right so it's very

381
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,240
important for the policy of the chain I

382
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,770
mean the chain has its purpose so the

383
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,390
policy of the chain should make sure

384
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:46,420
that the reductions that are allowed do

385
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:49,460
not alter do not alter any monetary

386
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,140
information of the transaction

387
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,240
like the amounts or the contract

388
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,360
information or the addresses or anything

389
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,860
like that and the point is let's say

390
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,080
that some minor words for such a

391
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,340
redaction all right so it's like he

392
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,379
clearly would for this it is it's it's

393
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,629
publicly verifiable the request is

394
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,030
public so you as a user if you are the

395
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,580
victim of this particular malicious

396
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:16,580
behavior all right you can clearly call

397
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,800
this out you can you can say that I mean

398
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,110
it's getting redacted I mean this is

399
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,450
wrong I mean I'm losing money this in a

400
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,790
way imposes a rational behavior on part

401
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,980
of the minors to ensure that I mean they

402
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,510
are invested in the network so they need

403
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,120
to ensure that I mean they don't mess

404
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,570
with the monetary aspects of the chain

405
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,770
and even if you're not online to do this

406
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,810
let's say that you're not online then

407
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,760
you can come later at a point whenever

408
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,110
you are coming online and say that I

409
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,879
mean you you have your original

410
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,550
transaction with you so you can claim

411
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,260
that oh man my transaction is modified

412
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,260
you I mean people can verify the hash

413
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,850
and your transaction and you PR the true

414
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,850
victim it will be addressed yeah thank

415
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,230
you for your presentation um I have one

416
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,330
question regarding the incentives for

417
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,180
minors to actually participate in the

418
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,490
voting are there any additional

419
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:12,580
incentives to compensate for their

420
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:16,370
additional work that they have to do so

421
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,570
additional work here would be including

422
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:22,520
a hash in the mind block but I see that

423
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,350
in I see the question on incentives why

424
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,930
why would they even work for its word

425
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:30,590
for something all right so as I said the

426
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:32,780
motivation is that the whole the whole

427
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,929
adaptability and the existence of the

428
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,190
blockchain is at stake if some

429
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,900
jurisdictions you know say that the

430
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,830
miners can no longer use the chain so

431
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,870
the the miners who are in invested in

432
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,389
the well-being of the blockchain would

433
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,209
ideally want widespread adaptability

434
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,490
right so and if they see that there's a

435
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,860
clear harmful content that some

436
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,560
requesting guy is pointing to and they

437
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,629
fail to you know participate in the

438
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,290
voting in a way they are - they're going

439
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:08,560
to lose on you know their own

440
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:10,830
Cheng's well-being and yeah so thank you

441
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,830
very much
