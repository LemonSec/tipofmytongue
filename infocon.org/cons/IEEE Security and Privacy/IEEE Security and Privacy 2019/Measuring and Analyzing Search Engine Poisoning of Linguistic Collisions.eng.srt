00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,150
hi I'm Matthew Jocelyn and I'm from the

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,250
University of Texas at Dallas today I'll

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,650
be presenting my paper measuring and

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,079
analyzing search engine poisoning of

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,930
linguistic collisions this is joint work

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,090
with my adviser Shuang Chow and our

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,640
collaborators young Lee and house and

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,400
Zhu from Shanghai Shanghai Jia Tong

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,410
University and Minho Sharif from

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,530
Macquarie University so search is very

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,059
important to the web when a user wants

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,190
to find a page even one that they

13
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,980
visited before they often won't search

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,750
enter the URL or domain name instead

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,480
they often use a search engine to search

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,219
for the keyword for example if you've

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,349
needed to find the ESPY conference

18
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,030
program over the past three days you

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,399
probably just search for the keyword in

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,149
fact most of us probably can't remember

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,849
the URL not surprisingly a majority of

22
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,800
web traffic comes from search and up to

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,619
ninety percent of users stop searching

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,030
after the first page websites know that

25
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,880
search is important so they carefully

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,490
optimize their sites to return remain on

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,729
the first page of results as a result

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,949
the great ranking on the first page of

29
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,759
results is very difficult for popular

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,860
terms users also make spelling mistakes

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,229
when typing in their searches for

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,840
instance if a user wants to search from

33
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,908
Adobe and they accidentally swapped the

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,409
last two characters they may actually

35
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:41,060
search for a misspelling adversaries

36
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,500
have known for a long time that this is

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,869
a problem and so they've targeted

38
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,119
misspellings in search engine

39
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,979
optimization for instance

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,469
Snickers targeted a variety of

41
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,390
misspellings in their search ad campaign

42
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:56,059
you're not you when you're hungry and

43
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,979
Amazon was recently ordered to stop typo

44
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,079
targeting misspellings and Birkenstocks

45
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:05,240
a German shoe retailer to help improve

46
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,440
the user experience and to protect users

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,269
from type of typos the search engines

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,660
have introduced auto correction and auto

49
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:16,880
suggestion defenses these defenses help

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,799
improve the user experience and they

51
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,870
warn the user that their search query

52
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:24,690
may be misspelled they may even it

53
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,690
odd edit the search results if they have

54
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,540
high confidence so for instance if a

55
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,890
user searches for miss Dobie and they

56
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,019
accidentally swap the last two

57
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,670
characters the search engine has high

58
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,400
confidence that they actually meant to

59
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,140
search for the company name Adobe and so

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,170
they change all of the search results to

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:49,410
B for Adobe similarly if a user searches

62
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,720
for a Dobek by appending a C to the word

63
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,340
Adobe and the search engine has medium

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,560
confidence that they meant to search for

65
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,100
Adobe they may only change the first

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,810
result in Adobe and only warn the user

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,280
that the search query may be misspelled

68
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,099
finally if a user misspells Adobe by

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,040
replacing and Oh with au and the search

70
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,899
engine has low confidence they may not

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,319
change any of the results and instead

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,819
ask the user did you mean Adobe these

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,099
all of these different types of

74
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,560
Defense's offers some sort of protection

75
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,268
to the user either they warn the user or

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,940
they even change the users search

77
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,910
results these defenses seem to be

78
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,010
effective as we observed spammers on

79
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,560
underground forums complaining that

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,310
these defenses have made misspelling SEO

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,560
much more difficult to avoid these

82
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,840
automated Corrections by search engines

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,180
attackers can employ a new type of

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,280
attack which we term linguistic

85
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,230
collision misspellings these

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
misspellings can avoid automated

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,000
defenses because they coincide with

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,670
existing words even in other languages

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,540
for instance if a user searches for

90
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,940
cialis and deletes the a they may

91
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,328
actually search for sillas which the

92
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,700
search engine won't autocorrect this is

93
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,359
because sillas is an existing word in

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,910
the esperanto language meaning Chili's

95
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,530
however the search user will not be

96
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,120
shown results that were related to

97
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,219
Chili's instead they'll be shown a

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,780
variety of different URLs that are

99
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,880
advertising cialis in fact they may even

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,359
see advertisements that were purchased

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,550
by advertisers to promote cialis or they

102
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,710
may see illicit pharmaceutical websites

103
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,830
which managed to achieve high rank for

104
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,830
this

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,389
to understand how widespread linguistic

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,979
collisions are we analyzed the two most

107
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,039
popular languages on the Internet

108
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,659
English and Chinese for English we

109
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,849
looked at the Google search engine and

110
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,620
which has the highest market share and

111
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:55,659
we looked at the Baidu search engine

112
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:01,120
which has the which is the most popular

113
00:04:55,659 --> 00:05:03,669
search engine for Chinese speakers we

114
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,060
also looked at to understand how

115
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,818
prevalent these active or active

116
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,310
attacker activity is across different

117
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:15,430
types of keywords we looked at the Alexa

118
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,469
10k names and we checked for English and

119
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,870
then we also wanted to understand what

120
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:22,000
types of keywords attackers may target

121
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,000
so we looked at 13 different categories

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,190
for English and Chinese so in English we

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,180
looked at four different spin English

124
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,509
and Chinese we looked at four different

125
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,330
spam related categories the drugs adult

126
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:37,000
and gambling and software so these are

127
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,000
typical targets for spammers that we

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,909
thought they may continue to a target in

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,099
linguistic collision attacks so for

130
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:48,490
instance in English we looked at cialis

131
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:51,190
the popular drug and poker a gambling

132
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:55,509
game and in Chinese we looked at dama

133
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,270
which means marijuana and mahjong the

134
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:00,639
popular gambling game we also looked at

135
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,770
nine other types of categories which

136
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,469
include popular product names and brand

137
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,479
names because we believe these terms

138
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:12,279
could be also be targeted by attackers

139
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:14,199
similar to what Amazon did so now that

140
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,770
we have our set of target keywords we

141
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,210
can look at the generating the

142
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,750
misspellings using a variety of

143
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,008
different processes for both languages

144
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,659
once we have the misspellings we can

145
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,520
check on the search engines to see which

146
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:30,729
terms will not be Auto corrected and

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,889
avoid the defense's and finally after we

148
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,599
know which search results are not auto

149
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:39,629
corrected we can check on a public

150
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:42,128
blacklist to see which ones are poisoned

151
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,020
so for English it's relatively

152
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,180
straightforward to generate misspellings

153
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,460
we can use the Demerol Levenstein edit

154
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,290
distance one operations these

155
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,289
was to insert a character replace a

156
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,460
character transposed two characters or

157
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,830
delete a character

158
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,530
so in particular we limited the

159
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,950
replacement operations to the adjacent

160
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,260
keys on a QWERTY keyboard we also looked

161
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,849
at the vowel replacement operations

162
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,310
because we believe users may

163
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,980
accidentally misspelled the word and

164
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,870
these words also have a higher chance of

165
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:20,230
still being existing words in another

166
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:21,580
language so for Chinese so brute force

167
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,960
checking all of these different

168
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,090
generated misspellings is a bit

169
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
time-consuming we don't want to check

170
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,289
all of the Alexa 10k generated

171
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,720
misspellings as that's going to require

172
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,100
a lot of different searches and although

173
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,870
you might expect that we could just

174
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,480
check dictionaries these dictionaries

175
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,940
have poor coverage for things like slang

176
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,990
product terms and some languages have

177
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,360
poor coverage just in general so we

178
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,130
introduce a character level recurrent

179
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,200
neural network to predict which

180
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,990
misspellings will not be Auto corrected

181
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,090
by the search engine we train this

182
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,550
network with existing words and

183
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,159
dictionaries and then we are able to

184
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,920
predict the probability distribution of

185
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,700
the next character and a sequence of

186
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,580
work characters so for Chinese the

187
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,729
situation is a bit different Chinese

188
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:18,310
users use pinyin input as a main method

189
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:20,260
for searching on Baidu the pinyin input

190
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,990
method allows users to type Chinese

191
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,090
words using the English alphabet so we

192
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,800
can use the Demerol Evan Stein at a

193
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,349
distance one operations that we

194
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,710
mentioned previously however we can also

195
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,210
use some more interesting properties of

196
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,070
Chinese to generate other types of

197
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,030
misspellings

198
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:42,130
for instance the same pinyin can map to

199
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:45,720
different words and different tones can

200
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,820
map to different characters for instance

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,190
mahjong with the same pronunciation can

202
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:56,260
either mean a tile-based game or sesame

203
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,940
sauce we can also look at the fuzzy

204
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,490
opinion because there's multiple

205
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,720
dialects in Chinese some users may not

206
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,170
be able to distinguish

207
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,290
similar-sounding sounds and so fuzzy

208
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,610
pinyin allows these users to enter

209
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,829
similar sounding consonants and vowels

210
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,899
interchangeably so we use these

211
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,359
substitutions to generate other types of

212
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,459
misspellings because the pinyin input

213
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,019
method requires that a misspelled

214
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:24,069
Chinese word still be an existing

215
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,829
Chinese word for the Chinese data set we

216
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:30,729
can simply check to see whether it is in

217
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:32,529
a Chinese dictionary so now that we have

218
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,420
our set of input misspelled keywords

219
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:36,339
we're going to check on Google and Baidu

220
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,099
to see which terms will not be Auto

221
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,720
corrected after we know which ones are

222
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,610
not auto corrected we can check across

223
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,339
virustotal to see which ones are

224
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,079
blacklisted we also check to see the

225
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,089
search volumes and the device types of

226
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,449
users who are searching for these terms

227
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:54,490
on Google Adwords and Baidu index and

228
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:56,680
finally to understand why search engines

229
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,509
may fail to auto corrects English

230
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,758
searches we checked using Google

231
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:04,600
Translate to see what languages they are

232
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,069
identified as so overall we collected

233
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,279
just under 1.8 million

234
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,870
misspelling keywords and we found that

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,149
for misspellings which aren't auto

236
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,250
corrected by search engines that is

237
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:18,579
linguistic collision misspellings just

238
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:22,839
under 1.2 percent have search results

239
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,969
that are poisoned on the first page so

240
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,579
for English we can look at the different

241
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:32,529
categories here on the x-axis we have

242
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:36,870
the for spammer perennial favorites on

243
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:39,970
the left and we also have the nine

244
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,160
product terms on the right and on the

245
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,649
y-axis you can see the percentage of

246
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,329
searches which were poisoned we also

247
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,399
have five different cases here the

248
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,699
original search term and then three

249
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,230
types of auto correction defenses and

250
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:55,240
finally we have the non auto corrected

251
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,100
case that is the linguistic collision

252
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,399
misspellings which are not protected at

253
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,750
all the users are not warned so you can

254
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,550
see that some of these perennial

255
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,769
favorites the drugs adult and gambling

256
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:10,479
categories are targeted at over four

257
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:12,610
times the rate of others similarly for

258
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,820
Chinese we can see that these perennial

259
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,770
favorites are again targeted in Chinese

260
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,070
it's interesting to note that overall

261
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:24,990
the autocorrected cases exhibit a lower

262
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,990
overall poisoning rate than English

263
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,290
finally for Alexa we checked the 1k

264
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,910
domain names exhaustively so that we

265
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,540
could compare with our RN and based

266
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,610
results we found that the RN n is 2.8

267
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,439
times more efficient than randomly

268
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,490
sampling the misspellings we generate

269
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,850
using the processes described earlier we

270
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:51,250
also check the Alexa 10k names using the

271
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,070
RN n and we found that attackers do

272
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,770
industry exhibit activity across the

273
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,210
long tail of domains and this makes us

274
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:03,730
think that this is quite a common

275
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:05,530
technique we also examine what types of

276
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,110
devices users are using when they search

277
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,089
for these words for English we got this

278
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,790
data from Google Adwords and for Chinese

279
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,680
we use Baidu index so you can see here

280
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,930
that we have both the original keywords

281
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,239
and the misspellings that were poisoned

282
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,609
by attackers and you can see that for

283
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,850
the original keywords desktop has a

284
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,730
higher break higher user percentage

285
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,930
while the misspellings that attackers

286
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:36,400
target have a higher mobile number this

287
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:38,650
may be due to the fact that the mobile

288
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,590
users can more likely make misspelling

289
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:46,449
mistakes on small screens so we also

290
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,210
looked at the top domains in English

291
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,000
that contributed to the these poisonings

292
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,210
we found that the top traffic

293
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,420
monetization is malvert izing and we

294
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:02,380
also saw that there's a wide range of

295
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:04,390
different domains here some are

296
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,930
poisoning a large number of searches and

297
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:10,150
using a wide variety of URLs and you can

298
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:14,439
notice here too that the zero catch and

299
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:17,340
at space domains are using third level

300
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,680
domains this means that they're actually

301
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:23,260
free hosting sites that the attackers

302
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,550
are using to host their infrastructure

303
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,500
and avoid paying for their attacks also

304
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,349
note that the one of the names

305
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,520
censored and we can check the paper for

306
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,030
the bill

307
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,490
I mean and finally we also checked the

308
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:42,339
languages as identified by Google

309
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,410
Translate and we found that English is

310
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,890
the primary language that we're seeing

311
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,199
linguistic collisions with from English

312
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,610
to English that is and you can also see

313
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,900
that drugs has a lower overall English

314
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,350
percentage we think this may be due to

315
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,230
the fact that most of the inputs and the

316
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:05,320
drugs category use more scientific or

317
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:08,170
chemistry based names and so the sir the

318
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,680
Google Translate may auto detect them as

319
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,760
being something other than English and

320
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,219
finally there's also a longtail of

321
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,620
different languages here we found 74

322
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:22,570
different languages with collisions so

323
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,970
in conclusion we conducted the first

324
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,670
investigation into linguistic collisions

325
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:31,090
for English and Chinese and we found

326
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,310
that 1.2 percent of linguistic collision

327
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,630
misspellings that's is misspellings

328
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,670
which are not auto corrected have

329
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,310
poisoned search results on the first

330
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,439
page we also found that certain

331
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,449
categories are more heavily targeted and

332
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,839
mobile users are more likely to search

333
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,800
for poison terms thank you for your

334
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:55,990
attention I'm happy to take any

335
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:57,300
questions now thanks Matthew we have

336
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,620
time for a few questions

337
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,479
Luke desert house from Samsung research

338
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,589
America uh maybe this isn't the paper

339
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,839
but it didn't come up in the

340
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:07,210
presentation have you had any response

341
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,339
from Google or by dude this seems like

342
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,560
their responsibility but if I searched

343
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:14,740
for peppers I should see things about

344
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,479
peppers yeah this is kind of a difficult

345
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,880
problem for the search engines to solve

346
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,500
because you know users may actually be

347
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,390
intending to search for these in some

348
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,970
cases and it's not exactly obvious that

349
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,460
you can cleanly define which terms are

350
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,570
you know actually misspellings and which

351
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:39,940
terms are actually you know what the

352
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,050
user is meant to search for no le canals

353
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,490
I'm gonna give other universities

354
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,020
auctioneering Institute

355
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,380
kind of surprised by that one result you

356
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,990
showed where the Chinese results were at

357
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,399
a much lower base rate of infection if

358
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,510
you have any insight into why that might

359
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,339
be yeah

360
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,140
so that's seems to be I should have

361
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:59,370
mentioned in the talk but we found that

362
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,870
basically Baidu seems to heavily prefer

363
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,270
reputed domains so we saw that the same

364
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,690
thousand domains actually occurred for

365
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:10,089
about 93 percent of the search listings

366
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,670
in the non autocorrected case are in the

367
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,140
autocorrected cases yeah does that mean

368
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,490
the poisoned ones would be farther down

369
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,630
the chain farther down the search

370
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,209
results so they did something not

371
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,060
present no so they're still ranking in

372
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,579
the first result about as often as the

373
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,839
other domains they're just if I

374
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,320
understand your correct question

375
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,080
correctly they are still showing up and

376
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,910
they're not those searches aren't as

377
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,310
competitive so those misspellings aren't

378
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,160
as competitive yeah thank you question

379
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,229
from the back please so my name is Tina

380
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm from the Federal Trade Commission my

381
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,670
question is I noticed you were looking

382
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,620
primarily at organic search results do

383
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,079
you bother looking into like the ads

384
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,420
that show up do searches as well that's

385
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,760
a great question yes we plan on doing

386
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,219
that in our future work my second

387
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,319
question is in terms of the range of the

388
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,839
malicious URLs did you notice that

389
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,040
they're primarily in the dot-com like if

390
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,260
they're trying to particularly take

391
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,188
advantage of brand names or do you

392
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,579
notice that they were taking advantage

393
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:15,150
of like different retail DS as well I

394
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,149
think we should take that offline yeah

395
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,000
Bhuvana tracing them from University of

396
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,119
Texas Dallas it's a very interesting

397
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,449
paper so my question is what is the

398
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,389
ultimate goal of the attacker right yeah

399
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,460
yes could you sort of expedite on that a

400
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,540
bit yes so they want to promote these

401
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,910
poison

402
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,580
URLs right it's really difficult if you

403
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,040
want to rank for the first result on

404
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,070
Google but it's much easier if you want

405
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,800
to rank for a you know a misspelling of

406
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,950
Google and I think some other types of

407
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,710
delivering spam have gotten less easy to

408
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,690
conduct for instance I don't open all of

409
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,050
my email and most of it just gets

410
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:58,690
filtered by Google Mail so

411
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,590
this is a pretty easy way low-cost way

412
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:07,300
low-risk way to promote yeah okay thank

413
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,500
you thank you let's thank the speaker

414
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,139
one more time

415
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,140
[Applause]
