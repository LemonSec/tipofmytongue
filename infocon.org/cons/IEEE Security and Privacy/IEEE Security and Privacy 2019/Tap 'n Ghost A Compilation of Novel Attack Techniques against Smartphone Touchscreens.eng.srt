1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,280
yeah thanks for the winter

2
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:17,220
and sorry about

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,860
hello everyone again I'm SATA moriyama

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,529
I'm presenting tapping ghost a

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,040
comparison of Naga attack techniques

6
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,860
against smartphone touchscreens this is

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,860
joint work with mr. Satya Wakabayashi

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:40,140
and my supervisor professor Satya Mori

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:42,079
was at the university hopping ghost

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,970
it's an attack against Android

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,610
smartphones and the attack connects the

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,450
attackers Bluetooth device or a Wi-Fi

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,400
access point to the victim smartphone

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,030
this attack consists of two techniques

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,640
the first one is an attack against NFC

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,010
enabled smartphones the other one is an

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,189
attack against capacitive touchscreens

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,070
of smartphones these techniques can be

19
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:13,258
covertly embedded into common objects

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:16,949
such as food furniture now I'll explain

21
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:19,499
how erotic works this time we assume

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,560
that the attacker implements the attack

23
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:26,399
in a wooden table and puts a table

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,789
somewhere in advance in this table in

25
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:33,420
NFC card emulator and a metal sheet are

26
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:36,270
embedded when the victim put the

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,240
smartphone on the table this NFC Cal

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:45,090
emulator requests the smartphone to pair

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,429
with attackers Bluetooth device then a

30
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,729
dialog box pops up on the screen as

31
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:53,039
shown in the slide this dialog box says

32
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,158
are you sure you want to pair the

33
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:58,799
Bluetooth device the victim will touch

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,609
the no bottom because they don't know

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,529
why this tile box pops up and they don't

36
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,459
want to pair with unknown Bluetooth

37
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:10,288
devices however using the metal sheet

38
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,260
embedded in the table

39
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:16,290
the attacker conducts the attack against

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,870
capacitive touchscreens then the

41
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,140
attacker can scatters a full touch event

42
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,170
as shown by the orange circles in the

43
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,170
slide and make the device act as wave

44
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,869
the other button or

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,079
yes button had to be in touched with a

46
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,870
certain weight so the victim smartphone

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,620
is paired with that I've got Bluetooth

48
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,560
device as a result the attacker can

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,690
fully take control of smartphone for

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,010
instance the attacker can install any

51
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:54,800
applications using our pet Brutus Mouse

52
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:58,609
and here is a short demo video as you

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,720
can see the attacker puts an NFC tag and

54
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,870
a metal seat there when I put my

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,470
smartphone on them a dialog box pops up

56
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,410
on the screen

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,959
and I touch the cancel button however

58
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:19,010
the smartphone is tricked into thinking

59
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:21,560
the connect button has been touched this

60
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,470
post message indicates that the connect

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:30,470
button has been touched and it means the

62
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:33,799
success of the attack in the following

63
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:40,100
slide I'm going to describe two attack

64
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:42,650
techniques that compose our attack first

65
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,100
I'll explain the latter attack technique

66
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,350
called stud generator the ghost touch

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:54,290
generator is an attack against

68
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:57,410
capacitive touchscreens among a variety

69
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,590
of touchscreen technologies we focus on

70
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:04,150
mutual capacitive touch screens because

71
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:07,370
they are widely used in smartphones a

72
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,150
controller of a mutual capacitive touch

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,049
screen consists of the grid of the

74
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,000
transmitter electrodes

75
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:19,700
TX and the receiver electrodes rx these

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,960
two types of electrodes are very close

77
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,140
together and walkers capacitors so the

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,590
alternating electric current from the TX

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,590
Electro's flows into the RX Electro's

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,159
when when a finger approaches a

81
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,150
touchscreen the finger also works as a

82
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,600
Kappa

83
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:48,679
so some of the current also goes into

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,600
the finger thus current that rose from

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,050
TX to rx

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,830
decreases by measuring this current

87
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:04,150
change that touchscreen concerns finger

88
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:07,159
touches and yeah here is what we did as

89
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,979
explained before the touchscreen sense

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,550
touches by measuring the electric

91
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:16,670
current change as the RX electrodes so

92
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,970
if the attacker injects noise signals

93
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,580
from the external metal sheet to the RX

94
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,000
electrodes the touchscreen detect

95
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,060
touches at locations where no real touch

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,910
is present we named this technique

97
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:40,010
called touch generator and yeah this is

98
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:42,140
a demo video of the gosset generator as

99
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,770
you can see the touchscreen works

100
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:49,219
properly at first however after the

101
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,979
attacker start injecting noise for study

102
00:05:49,220 --> 00:06:00,740
band are scattered along the line where

103
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:03,140
the real touch is present we implemented

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,350
the ghost touch generator and tried to

105
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,219
attack seven smartphone models listed in

106
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,580
the slide as a result we succeeded in

107
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,540
causing force touch event in five out of

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,510
the seven models however we also found

109
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:25,510
that the noise frequency to call this

110
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,510
malfunction varies by smartphone model

111
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,970
here's a summary of the ghost touch

112
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,849
generator this attack technique

113
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,880
scattered false touch event on

114
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:41,180
touchscreens by injecting intentional

115
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,610
noise signals however to mount the

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,280
attack the attacker needs to identify

117
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:54,020
the victim the smartphone model in

118
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:57,679
advance now let me talk about the

119
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,870
the other technique before using the

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,050
ghost touch generator the attacker

121
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,889
employs the attack against NFC enabled

122
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,500
smartphones this technique requests a

123
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:13,669
victim smartphone to connect to the

124
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,949
attackers device via NFC also this

125
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,099
technique enables to retrieve

126
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:22,340
information which is indispensable to

127
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:29,810
the ghost touch generator such as victim

128
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:32,210
smartphone model so what is NFC NFC is

129
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,539
an abbreviation for Near Field

130
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,870
Communication it's communication range

131
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:41,930
is less than 10 centimeters taking

132
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,960
advantage of this short range the NFC

133
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,219
devices establish a connection just by

134
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,859
bringing devices close to each other

135
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:54,710
NFC is used in various things such as

136
00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:01,310
credit cards smartphones and smart

137
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:04,099
posters NFC enabled under the

138
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,880
smartphones always look around for

139
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:11,599
nearby NFC devices when the smartphone

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:15,099
is held over an NFC tag it performs

141
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,650
various operations by reading the data

142
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:21,500
recorded in the NFC tag such as a

143
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:24,380
opening girl website connecting to a

144
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,949
Wi-Fi access point or pairing a

145
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,550
Bluetooth device before some risky

146
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,950
operations like the bluetooth pairing

147
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:44,870
Android OS shows the confirmation dialog

148
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:46,850
box as usual before and before using the

149
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,490
ghost touch narrator the attacker has to

150
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,110
do two things

151
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,290
identifying the victim in smartphone

152
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:58,250
model and requesting to connect to the

153
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:02,209
attackers device however each NFC tag

154
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:04,250
can launch only one operation so to deal

155
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,060
with this program the attacker

156
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,170
makes use of any

157
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,770
the emulation it mu it enables to

158
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,770
emulate an NFC tag and the dynamically

159
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,410
change its content so the attacker can

160
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,439
launch much more operations see can

161
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,560
surely the attacker can obtain

162
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,830
information and request a bluetooth

163
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,130
pairing by following these steps first

164
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,450
the attacker requests to open the

165
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,980
attackers website and this website

166
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,160
identifies the victim in smartphone

167
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,550
model from the user agent and tells it

168
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,670
to the attacker then the attacker

169
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,729
changes the content of NFC tag and

170
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:53,729
requests to pair with the attackers

171
00:09:50,730 --> 00:10:01,050
Bluetooth device we call this technique

172
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:04,110
a tag based adaptive ploy now let me

173
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:07,020
summarize the two attack techniques that

174
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,120
compose our attack first

175
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,960
the attacker attacks victim in

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,320
smartphone via NFC in this attack the

177
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:21,150
attacker can get smartphone information

178
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:24,750
and we request a Bluetooth telling then

179
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:27,360
the confirmation dialog box pops up if

180
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,830
the yes button on the dialog box is

181
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:36,210
touched the attack is successful next

182
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:39,330
the smartphone next using the smartphone

183
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:42,140
model information the attacker attacks

184
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,270
the touchscreen of the victim smartphone

185
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,880
in this attack this smartphone is

186
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,360
tricked into thinking that the yes

187
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,439
button has been touched with about a 50%

188
00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:00,390
chance consequently the attacker can

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:03,000
fully take control of the smartphone so

190
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:07,980
let's move on to the feasibility of this

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,250
wet our attack must make use of NFC the

192
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:15,510
communication range of which is short so

193
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:18,690
the attacker also succeeds if the victim

194
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,340
uses their smart phone near the table

195
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,910
you know

196
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,970
tabletop in which the attacker has

197
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:28,640
installed the attack device so to

198
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,840
evaluate the feasibility of the attack

199
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,650
we conducted a deceptive study in the

200
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,430
study

201
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:40,840
we asked 16 participants to sit at the

202
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,910
marshal's table without telling them

203
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:50,380
investigated how often the victims

204
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:54,050
device came within the attack range and

205
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,810
yeah the last picture shows with the

206
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,510
table that we used in the deceptive

207
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:04,219
study and the right figure shows a

208
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:06,650
result of the study this horizontal bars

209
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,150
in the right figure represents the

210
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:13,699
result for each participant and x-axis

211
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:17,630
represents a time from when the

212
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:20,990
participants sit at the table yeah so

213
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:24,290
let's take a look at the top bar the

214
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:28,550
black part in the bar indicates the time

215
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:32,209
when a participant was vulnerable to the

216
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,719
attack that is when the smartphone were

217
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:40,250
being unlocked and close enough to the

218
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,640
table to summarize a result 15 out of

219
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:47,390
the 16 participants presented several

220
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:51,230
opportunities to be attacked within 15

221
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:56,300
minutes when they used the smartphone at

222
00:12:51,230 --> 00:13:00,710
the table based on the result of the

223
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:04,130
user study we evaluated overall success

224
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:07,550
probability of the attack and we found

225
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:11,810
that our attack had a 71 percent chance

226
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,810
of success if we assume 30 people take a

227
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,510
seat at the table and the attacker can

228
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,290
try the attack three times for each

229
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:25,360
person so we conclude that the threat of

230
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,360
the top and Ghost is feasible

231
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:33,240
in our paper we also proposed

232
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:37,290
countermeasures the first countermeasure

233
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:40,890
is to add user approval processes before

234
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:44,490
opening a website specified by an NFC

235
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:48,449
tag the Android OS should get users

236
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,820
confirmation then the attacker who don't

237
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,670
get to information about the smartphone

238
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:57,990
so they wouldn't be able to conduct

239
00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,180
attacks against touchscreens the other

240
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,720
countermeasure is to detect the

241
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,469
malfunction on touchscreens the kosta

242
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,300
generator generates for studies with

243
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:12,930
characteristic spatial patterns so

244
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:19,949
identifying these patterns will help to

245
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:23,459
prevent the attack with the aid of jpcc

246
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,370
we share the result of our study with

247
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,529
several smartphone manufacturers

248
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,640
including Sony Ericsson Fujitsu and

249
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:35,760
sharp with one of the manufacturers we

250
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,510
performed an additional experiment using

251
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,730
their latest smartphone model and

252
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,730
confirmed that the attack was successful

253
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:49,550
on the device and they are in the

254
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,550
process of looking at at a possible fix

255
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,329
in conclusion topping ghost is a new

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,630
type of attack which exploits NFC and

257
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,969
touchscreens this attack connects the

258
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,339
attackers Bluetooth device or Wi-Fi

259
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,910
access point to the victim smartphone

260
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:11,850
and we have confirmed the feasibility of

261
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:15,660
the attack through user studies and have

262
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,940
provided possible countermeasures thank

263
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,870
you for your attention and I'd happy to

264
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,870
take any questions

265
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:30,410
please line up for questions and give

266
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:34,069
your name and affiliation hi my name is

267
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:36,019
near security researcher with intel you

268
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,618
mentioned spatial characteristics of the

269
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,799
attack

270
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:42,829
to what degree other was inherent in the

271
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:45,169
existing touchscreen technology are they

272
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:48,488
always horizontal that's the first part

273
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:54,279
of the question and then the second part

274
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:59,179
I'll get to ok so your question is why

275
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:01,249
why the force touch event appears on the

276
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:06,169
overlying horizon terrain

277
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:11,619
yes mmm this is because the ghost has

278
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:22,339
generator only affects the RX electrodes

279
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:30,379
which is touched by a finger so last

280
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:33,350
week so mm yeah if when when the finger

281
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:36,679
doesn't touch the touchscreen the noise

282
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,709
from the ghost touch generator only

283
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:43,459
changes the entire voltage of the

284
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:47,659
circuit so it doesn't change a electric

285
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:54,258
current flow as our works Electro's but

286
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:56,929
when the finger is attached the the when

287
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:02,119
the finger is touched the RX electro

288
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:07,039
laws it forms a loop sub kit including

289
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:09,799
rx electrodes so that is the ghost touch

290
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,559
generator is directly connected in

291
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:18,549
parallel with the erector erector laws

292
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:21,908
which is touched so so this is why the

293
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:27,349
first achievement appear on Orion or

294
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:31,639
corresponding rx electrodes so so this

295
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:33,980
is also why the area character oh sorry

296
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:35,590
the force touch event appears on the

297
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,860
horizon terrain

298
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,789
we used the smart touch screen that the

299
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,719
rx

300
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:45,710
Electro's installed horizontally so this

301
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,700
is sorry

302
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:53,919
understood yeah and had you considered

303
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,919
range extension as well of your attack

304
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:10,039
you considered ways of extending the

305
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:13,090
range of the attack yes yes yeah we

306
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:16,690
think this attack can be not only

307
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:20,269
smartphones but also other important

308
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:23,360
devices which have touchscreens

309
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:28,629
as something like electronic voting

310
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:32,959
machine or ATM or something like that

311
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:36,980
and nowadays many important many devices

312
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:42,679
have touch screens as a user interface

313
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:44,960
so we are seeking that the cost a

314
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,960
generator can operate to these machines

315
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:53,480
of each of touch screens thank you

316
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:58,730
defensively oh but I'm Hilary Orman and

317
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm not from anywhere defensively what

318
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:06,460
what would protect the user how much

319
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:15,740
distance a kind of case stack of napkins

320
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:17,749
what would work yes in this attack the

321
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,840
ghost touch generator attack range is

322
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:27,950
longer than NFC communication range so

323
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:33,158
yeah to prevent the attack the users

324
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:39,440
don't the smartphone are close to the

325
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:41,960
table or that is longer than the NFC

326
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,200
communication range and NFC

327
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,090
communication range is about four

328
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,600
centimeters so if the big team

329
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,230
could hold their smartphone away of

330
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:02,100
longer than four centimeter they are

331
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:06,930
safe there was a question you should use

332
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,429
the mic otherwise okay well let's think

333
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,880
this speaker one last time then yeah

334
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,880
thank you
