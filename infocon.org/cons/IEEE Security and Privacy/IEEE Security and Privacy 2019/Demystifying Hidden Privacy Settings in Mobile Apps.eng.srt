00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:27,630
the title is demystifying Acadian

7
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:31,349
practices using mobile apps first let's

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,110
see what is a privacy setting take an

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,300
example Facebook there is a certain

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,540
named in your best friend's for better

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,640
service the Facebook use users current

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,820
location to enhance the social

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,010
connections to get users agreement they

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,470
provide a setting in the app and users

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,809
can set a setting to decide who can see

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,500
their current location to protect

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,579
themselves

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,720
so for understand more cat functionality

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,420
categories of privacy settings wait Lex

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,090
600 privacy settings from 200 apps and

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,600
according to that date have a project

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:15,659
the settings can be classified into six

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,210
categories the first one on the best

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,299
date has that has do share contacts with

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,729
wicker the sixth one about users

26
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,509
personal profiles such as show age on

27
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,999
your profile and the third users social

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,759
connection such as ask users who can see

29
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:35,339
your friend list and force users

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,429
behavior such as don't show my lesson in

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:43,979
history to my friends in musician app

32
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:46,770
fifth users posted content such as who

33
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,289
can see my diary and the last and his

34
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:54,449
band such as don't accept if users has

35
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:56,880
no profile I can it is important to note

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,240
in all the categories only on device

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,579
data can be protected by and resister

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,158
permission for the other eighty-seven

39
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,619
percentage of the privacy they can only

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,450
be controlled by the privacy settings so

41
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,910
in our study we want to understand

42
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,459
besides that for being your privacy data

43
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,459
protected by and resister permission

44
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,390
whether people really care about other

45
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,390
privacy protected by privacy settings so

46
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,869
we performed user study to an

47
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,089
users attitude check the Facebook as an

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,280
example game we showed us setting

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,980
screenshot and grab the city use a to

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,650
him in a question there like here we

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,989
tell them Facebook access your location

52
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,510
even when we are no using the app and

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,450
ask them what do you feel about if this

54
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,090
case happens we provide five choice for

55
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,119
them to choose from very upset or I

56
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,209
don't care the user study last for two

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,610
weeks and more than 200 people

58
00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:01,739
participating from the user studies

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:04,820
result we find the 83.5 percentage of

60
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:08,010
participants choose a absent or very

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:12,049
upset for at least one process it into

62
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,790
your questionnaire and 71 percentage

63
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,730
participants think the privacy's that

64
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,100
you relate theater as important as or

65
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,590
even more important than those covered

66
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,489
by and resist permission so the problem

67
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,680
comes if users cannot find this valuable

68
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:31,470
privacy settings the privacy may be

69
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,470
disclosed the way those users consent

70
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,890
let's see an example named ali pay a

71
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,709
chinese famous financial app has more

72
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,130
than 1 billion users worldwide it has a

73
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,140
certain limited show message details it

74
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,630
can't control whether show the message

75
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,970
details such as a month change of your

76
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:54,420
user account when user lock the screen

77
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,060
lock the mobile screen it is a privacy

78
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,280
setting but it's hard for users to find

79
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,180
in practice this is the settings UI pass

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,829
users can only find it by click the

81
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,739
indicator me in a home page of your

82
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,380
engine click the setting and then click

83
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,140
the general instead of the privacy

84
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,070
indicator in the settings view and click

85
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,140
the notification and eventually they can

86
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,380
find their setting this process setting

87
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,599
height too deep for users to locate so

88
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,669
in our work we call this hard to find

89
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:37,189
privacy setting as hidden privacy

90
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:39,438
setting besides Ali pay will also find

91
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:42,889
this problem in other apps such as

92
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,379
Facebook in to new 16 Facebook even was

93
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,809
given a Big Brother award as a biggest

94
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:51,589
privacy offender of the year because of

95
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:53,989
the hidden price of a team so we want to

96
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,360
understand what are the fundamental

97
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:59,119
causes of the problematic of the privacy

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,529
setting so we perform a second the

99
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:03,229
others that it'll clear to users

100
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:07,189
perception of the privacy setting design

101
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:10,699
way prepared testing apps and install

102
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:13,729
them on the emulator and real device for

103
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:16,249
users ask them to find for example we'd

104
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:19,099
tell them some social apps such as you

105
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:21,769
love often provide settings for users to

106
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:24,979
set whether to share location please

107
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:27,349
find it after they found it whereas them

108
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,659
how difficult was it to find a setting

109
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:31,998
and we still provide 5 choice for them

110
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:34,610
to choose from very easy to very

111
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:37,399
difficult if they choose a difficult or

112
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,800
very difficult we'll further as then why

113
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:43,369
did you have trouble finding it this

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,529
study includes about 600 privacy

115
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:48,769
settings and as for 3 months more than

116
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:52,779
700 people participant from the user

117
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:55,429
studies result participants think that

118
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,829
47 pointed to a percentage of the

119
00:05:55,429 --> 00:06:00,289
privacy setting a difficult or very

120
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:03,319
difficult to find and they also provide

121
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:05,419
us 1008 feedbacks for why they think

122
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,589
they are difficult to find or why they

123
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:12,109
think they cannot find it

124
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:14,599
for instance purchasing a participant

125
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,089
camera I don't see anywhere I go to

126
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,569
privacy settings it's not anywhere to be

127
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,559
found

128
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:24,259
you've seriously heavy there so with

129
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:26,449
some real settings and we find the root

130
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,749
causes of hidden privacy settings can be

131
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:32,119
classified to two categories the first

132
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:35,479
one when the privacy setting design

133
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:39,050
violates a user's habit for example when

134
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,688
the your app has is uncommon participant

135
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,879
it cannot find the settings in their

136
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:45,800
familiar path so they may ignore the

137
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,129
uncommon you have has to find the

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,360
privacy settings the second when looking

139
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:53,300
for the privacy

140
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,400
challenges users patience for example

141
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,460
when of you can't have too many elements

142
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,979
such as facebook again one of its real

143
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,500
contest even more than 50 UI elements to

144
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:09,258
click users were lost their patience

145
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,569
will find it so here we summarize the

146
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:16,250
six root causes from the feedbacks in

147
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:19,430
total so unless we want to understand in

148
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,789
a real world how seriously the hidden

149
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,340
privacy setting program covers to

150
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:28,729
discover hidden presence ative from a

151
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,310
large number of real word apps we probe

152
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,818
we designed an automatic patrol named

153
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,919
hunter the hunt had the design the

154
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,669
high-level design of the hunt has to say

155
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:44,090
steps first instructor privacy settings

156
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:46,400
wrap and identify the hidden processes

157
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,448
in front of privacy settings each step

158
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,330
contains a key classifier in this 9

159
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:56,599
probe extract settings from an app can

160
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:59,779
already be done by existing works that

161
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,599
have super so the key of the hunter he

162
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:06,620
returns to how to design suitable

163
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,080
features for the to classifier for the

164
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,139
class for the first classifier we use a

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,990
tf-idf of each word in the settings

166
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,740
description to design of features the

167
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,919
tf-idf can reflect how important a word

168
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,770
is to a document and in our work we use

169
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,400
it to reflect how important award is to

170
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:31,359
a privacy setting description so in our

171
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,769
work we model each set interesting

172
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,029
description with the high level

173
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:40,448
dimension feature vectors each dimension

174
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:43,219
responding each race each dimension

175
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:46,130
represents the word in a word back if a

176
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,680
word in a sentence the corresponding

177
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:53,480
dimensions value is a word here for you

178
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,060
otherwise the dimensions value is 0 for

179
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,270
the second classifier way design 14

180
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,520
features to characterize summarize the

181
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,920
six root causes from the feedbacks for

182
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,829
example the cause of you can

183
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,380
gives too many elements we cancel number

184
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:12,439
of the elements in the view place in our

185
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,600
privacy setting as a feature line and we

186
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,300
also calculate a percentage of the

187
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,410
privacy setting of view as a feature 10

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,109
since in user studies some participants

189
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,750
content that privacy setting and other

190
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,380
general settings mixed together it's

191
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,360
hard for them to single out a jacket one

192
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,630
as a more detailed features can be found

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,670
in our paper and after we designer 40

194
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,089
features we found two calculator

195
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:44,630
features we need to know the Europe the

196
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:47,630
privacy setting spray precise uipath so

197
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,269
Nestor how to extraction web has becomes

198
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,360
the key point to calculation of features

199
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:55,820
one may think dynamic of one may think

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,579
of dynamic analysis but this approach is

201
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,519
ten consuming and can only extract the

202
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:05,479
material number of UI passes window so

203
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,970
in our work we use a static to extract

204
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,970
way way statically extracted but is

205
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,640
still challenging due to the complexity

206
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,310
of the layouts design and the limitation

207
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,209
of Java language a static analysis such

208
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,640
as how to do is inherent so in our work

209
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:25,518
weight is a novel technique named a

210
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,910
semantic base to bypass abstraction it's

211
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,310
based on observation as a title has a

212
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,600
semantic connection with the indicator

213
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:39,189
user Creek the Siddha

214
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,380
web has example of the era paid each

215
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,320
texture of the indicator has the same

216
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,290
semantics with the title of a view after

217
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,560
Calicut so we live ridges the menus of

218
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,319
the indicator and views to build up the

219
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,949
connection between them and the way back

220
00:10:54,319 --> 00:11:00,260
trace from the view placing the privacy

221
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:04,760
setting to the homepage and structure

222
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,680
the UI path so next way a detail how to

223
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,550
express this dimension from the

224
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,489
indicators and the views in app

225
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,609
indicators as to category two type of

226
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,829
category text and

227
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,709
I came for the text the text itself

228
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:23,439
provides best asthmatics and for that I

229
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:26,649
can we bridge the Google search engine

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,930
we upload images such as setting as a

231
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,050
figure showing and the Google's basket

232
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:35,949
says it might be a setting or idea so we

233
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:38,620
can know the semantics of icon and for

234
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:42,700
the view intuitively the title above you

235
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:45,279
can user for at least medics but if the

236
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,430
title if the view doesn't have title the

237
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,579
class enum and lay out file names such

238
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:55,660
as privacy setting totally out also may

239
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:57,849
have used as the views mannix so in this

240
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,040
way we can extract those methods of

241
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,040
indicators and abuse and build the

242
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,250
connections between them and extract a

243
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,010
given process that in the UI path we

244
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,880
developed our our to a hunt and use it

245
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:18,149
to analyze 170 apps from the real world

246
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:21,910
we found about 7,000 apps has about

247
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,459
18,000 process setting and in the seven

248
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,380
thousand apps nearly half of them have

249
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,279
hidden process setting and in the

250
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,930
privacy settings more than one third

251
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,660
more than one-third are difficult for

252
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,479
users to locate this results reveals

253
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:43,300
that in the real world the kingdom

254
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:45,339
professor setting is person massive and

255
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,209
we also study the problem to the

256
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:51,760
popularity from in a study we found in

257
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:55,180
an app with more increase it downloads

258
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,850
the app more of them have present

259
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,029
settings and in the meanwhile the app

260
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,579
with hidden fractionating increase an

261
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:06,850
educator an educated guess could be them

262
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,649
the developers of popular apps they may

263
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,480
pay more attention to the privacy

264
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,930
settings and they are more likely to

265
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:18,730
provide the make the settings more

266
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:20,979
explicit and we'll also study the hidden

267
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:25,180
privacy setting problem over time for

268
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,490
the 7000 apps we crowd the latest

269
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,560
version in a 20

270
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,930
and finally we've got about five

271
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,969
thousand ones and we after comparing

272
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,550
them we find some neo professor sitting

273
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,800
up here has some original privacy

274
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,770
setting disappear but the Sten use is

275
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,380
the hidden crevices team problem becomes

276
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,150
more serious not owning the such as the

277
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,220
figure show and not on in the app with

278
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,590
hidden privacy set him but also the

279
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,580
number and the percentage of hidden

280
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:56,370
privacy settings they all increase and

281
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,310
tourists donate some apps some apps

282
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,880
changed from easy to find in to hidden

283
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,250
in a new version after we look into them

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,410
and funded these apps increase the more

285
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,440
functionalities and corresponding

286
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,600
settings maybe it is because that it's

287
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,210
hard to balance the usability of that

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,850
and the control and privacy so that

289
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,060
developers do not even approach the set

290
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:24,900
him well but we are also happy to find

291
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,239
some as changed into easy to find in the

292
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,709
new version for example search has Baidu

293
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,900
map and BMW Motorrad they gathered the

294
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,350
previous schedule the privacy settings

295
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,230
such as in the tracking set of view and

296
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:43,770
legal notice view into users familiar

297
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:46,440
view not practice setting view we also

298
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,380
found this improve the apps or have a

299
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,510
large number of Eternals it appears as

300
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,910
again the popular apps attach more

301
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,860
importance to the designs of privacy

302
00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,860
settings they are more likely to make

303
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:04,440
the privacy setting usability better and

304
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:07,410
over when the freedoms have the same

305
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,320
problem will be even more serious when

306
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:13,890
they ask the to leak users privacy by

307
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,980
default so we collect Randy collector

308
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:20,330
privacy settings to study and the

309
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,550
results has your astonishes 78

310
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:26,460
percentage alpha 2 leaked user privacy

311
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,800
and on our hidden privacy city a higher

312
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,920
percent in 82 percentage of them

313
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,890
virtually killers privacy and char

314
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,750
surprise 100 percent of hidden privacy

315
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,449
setting in

316
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:42,170
user social connection categories expose

317
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:44,870
users privacy by default and one more

318
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,628
thing we find an interesting thing that

319
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,509
some text look like they are protecting

320
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:52,699
users such as a showing a picture to not

321
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:56,300
show people I follow and groups I've

322
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:58,609
joined but the switch the setting is

323
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,540
switched off by default so in fact the

324
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,939
privacy exposed we in our way you know

325
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,790
randomly selected privacy setting data

326
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:10,009
cells we find that more than 220

327
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,170
percentage of them has this problem so

328
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,930
users may just leave the set in there

329
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,740
and do not change the switches Deportes

330
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:22,790
status and they may leak their privacy

331
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,839
without any consent so based on our

332
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,300
study we provide winner de 5 suggestion

333
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,519
for developers to design better user

334
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,250
usability of a practice setting such as

335
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,269
less set improvisation starts and Europe

336
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:41,990
has and finally less conclusion let's

337
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:44,059
summarize our conclusion in our study we

338
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,620
have new understanding of hidden

339
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,050
practice setting we summarize the

340
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,720
potential causes of hidden process

341
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:54,199
setting and reviews the significant

342
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,250
impact in a real world and our work can

343
00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:00,290
help make helped design better usability

344
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,319
of a practice that in any has the

345
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,168
protection of the user protection and we

346
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,149
also provide a new technique to

347
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,490
automatically discover hidden privacy

348
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,799
settings we developed our hunt and it

349
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,289
helps us to a large study in the real

350
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,920
world there's for listening welcome

351
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:23,769
question

352
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,769
[Applause]

353
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,100
so if you have questions please come up

354
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,840
to the mic and your name in affiliation

355
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:36,719
please hi brian Mastan Burke Western

356
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,090
Digital did you evaluate how many of

357
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,670
these applications were available on a

358
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,439
European App Store or were otherwise

359
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:51,120
from vendors that would be subject to

360
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:53,430
gdpr sorry so I think many of the

361
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,719
settings examples you show would

362
00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:00,120
potentially violate the European GDP our

363
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,910
regulation and so I'm wondering how many

364
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,159
of these examples were applications that

365
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,860
were potentially subject to GDP are

366
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,390
maybe the more popular applications that

367
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,280
seem to be cleaning up their privacy

368
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:17,310
settings were doing so for compliance

369
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:20,730
reasons yeah we we actually analyzed the

370
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:24,240
app and we evaluate this estate in Spain

371
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:27,660
and as a user study so we we we heard

372
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,940
them 200 people to evaluate to the

373
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:34,890
settings we the hidden perhaps a setting

374
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:40,920
we discovered yeah any other questions

375
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:43,260
so I have one I guess so with your

376
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,450
reviews you were doing a lot of user

377
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,010
feedback on you know this is hidden were

378
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,870
there anything surprising in terms of

379
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,850
what users actually liked in privacy

380
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,649
settings can you invert the analysis to

381
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:57,389
say these are the best practices that we

382
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:59,580
found from users sorry you focus mostly

383
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,040
on hidden privacy and things that users

384
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,260
found to be confusing or difficult to

385
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,540
find but the inverse you could also say

386
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,190
like what was good to users what did

387
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,139
they actually find was helpful with

388
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:15,690
privacy settings from the surveys that

389
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:20,100
you ran yeah sorry

390
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:23,190
I heard the first the the the first part

391
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,719
of the people find their processes in

392
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,330
the people to find that I didn't catch

393
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,280
your question I'll follow up offline

394
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,520
let's think again

395
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,520
[Applause]
