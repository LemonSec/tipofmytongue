1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,370
thanks Mateus for the introduction so

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,259
today I'd like to talk about how users

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,840
respond when they think their accounts

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,490
have been attacked and so the data that

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,650
I'm going to cover came from a

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,750
cross-cultural interview study that I

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,189
conducted with people who had been told

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,189
that there was a suspicious login

9
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,380
incident to their real Facebook accounts

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,120
so many of you have probably seen a

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,269
notification that looks like this one

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,370
which says something like well recent

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,039
activity may have affected your account

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,480
security and we have secured your

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,730
account and you're gonna have to do some

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,108
extra things to get back in and because

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,898
there may have been a suspicious login

18
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,820
to the account and so I wanted to

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,609
understand what is it that people think

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,890
happened that led up to this particular

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,230
notification and what did they do

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,530
afterward so as part of the study

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,259
participants constructed causal incident

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,030
timelines where this notification was in

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,650
the center of the timeline and they

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,840
filled out kind of the pre and post

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,110
behavior of what they did and what they

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,910
think went on and in this work I

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,010
interviewed participants from five

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,840
different countries that I selected

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,660
based on the fact that they differed in

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,060
terms of degree of censorship degree of

33
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,570
Internet adoption and various cultural

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,220
in the indices like collectivism so the

35
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,520
countries that I studied where Brazil

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,160
Germany India the United States and

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,080
Vietnam so this work provides us not

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,420
only with some understanding of how

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,160
people respond to incidents but also

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,800
some understanding of how cultural

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,270
context may affect people's security

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,280
interpretation and experiences okay so

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,020
in order to do this kind of work I

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,720
wanted to make sure that users were

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,699
responding about real incidents that

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,590
happen to real accounts and that they

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,990
were able to talk about those incidents

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,120
very soon after they occurred so we

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,380
didn't have issues of like telescoping

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,450
bias where people have issues

51
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,818
remembering things or ecological

52
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,940
validity problems where if we ask them

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,518
to imagine a hypothetical incident they

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,280
may not be able to interpret that in the

55
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,060
same way as a real incident so I used

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,990
Facebook log data in order to identify

57
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,850
users from these five

58
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,040
trees who had just been told about this

59
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,590
suspicious login incident and they were

60
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,130
contacted immediately after getting that

61
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,080
notification and then they were offered

62
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,180
the opportunity to participate in an

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,970
interview in their native language and

64
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,270
in person within 14 days of the incident

65
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,180
occurring I aim to have 15 participants

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,400
per country and diversified on gender

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,430
age and education in order to get the

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,290
widest possible set of experiences and

69
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,540
one of the questions that often comes up

70
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,280
when doing a self-report or interview

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,620
work is whether people are actually

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,360
reporting accurately not that they

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,190
necessarily intend to lie but perhaps

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,980
they've forgotten things and so forth

75
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,470
and so where I could i've ala dated

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,970
their reports with facebook log data so

77
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,680
if someone said well I changed my

78
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,870
password on my Facebook account after

79
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,060
the incident I actually went and checked

80
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,100
if they had done so and in ninety-one

81
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,150
percent of the cases they had reported

82
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,609
accurately okay in order to ensure that

83
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,350
there was comparability and validity

84
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,930
across all of these different countries

85
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,700
in these different languages I did

86
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,730
extensive training with the interview

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,709
moderators so I personally piloted ten

88
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,450
interviews in the u.s. in order to

89
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,390
develop the interview protocol and this

90
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,369
time line drawing exercise I then hired

91
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,619
an interview training manager who

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,300
reviewed this protocol with moderators

93
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,270
in each of the countries and trained

94
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,910
them on the procedure I then listened in

95
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,070
with simultaneous translation to each

96
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,170
moderator doing practice interviews and

97
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,910
provided iterative feedback to ensure

98
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,799
that all of the moderators were giving

99
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,750
comparable interviews and that the

100
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,070
responses that were coming back from

101
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,820
these different participants were

102
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:08,100
comparable once I analyze this data

103
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,160
through a traditional qualitative coding

104
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,500
process and double coding I found that

105
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,780
there was a common process of incident

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,790
response across the participants from

107
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,709
all of these countries and I'm going to

108
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,959
briefly walk through this process today

109
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,360
but at a high level a participant will

110
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,130
become notified about the incident they

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,500
will then begin the process of causal

112
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,240
attribution and that process of causal

113
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,030
attribution is influenced both by

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,100
information they seek out as well as

115
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,130
their kind of general Facebook threat

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,260
and past experience my past experiences

117
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,570
some of which are affected by their

118
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,340
cultural context once they've gone

119
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,990
through causal attribution they'll have

120
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,390
established a mental model of the

121
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,460
incident the strength of that mental

122
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,860
model and what they've come up with then

123
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,710
drives whether they decide to take any

124
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,840
protective action and if they do so they

125
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,539
either take a protective action on the

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,460
platform so directly on Facebook or in

127
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,860
some cases they take additional

128
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,049
protective action off the platform if

129
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,140
they think that other accounts may have

130
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,090
been compromised all right so they start

131
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,460
out they gain incident awareness through

132
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,679
the notification and actually most

133
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,870
participants became aware not through

134
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,310
the notification message itself but

135
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,680
through the fact that they had to do a

136
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,020
unique secondary authentication process

137
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,970
so for example sometimes they would have

138
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,240
to identify pictures of friends or

139
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,040
people who they had recently had

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,160
comments with and this sort of unusual

141
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,320
thing is what raised their awareness the

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,270
secondary authentication task also

143
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,240
created a sense of partnership between

144
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,609
the users and the platform so one

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,590
participant said well it made me feel

146
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,690
like Facebook is on top of their game

147
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,369
and that someone's watching out for me

148
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,760
and the fact that I have to do something

149
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,260
as well

150
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,230
that means we're kind of in this

151
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:59,070
together so they had a positive reaction

152
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:01,350
to this most of the time okay next they

153
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,960
begin the process of causal attribution

154
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,970
so participants came up with their own

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,609
kind of classifications for these

156
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,600
incidents so they either thought it was

157
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,970
a false positive

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
for example they thought well I'm

159
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,590
logging in from a new location that's

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,170
why I got this or perhaps I did some bad

161
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,419
behavior so one participant said well I

162
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,860
was hacking like so I was liking lots

163
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,240
and lots and lots of posts and my

164
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,430
friends were liking lots and lots and

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,170
lots of posts too and Facebook must have

166
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,740
gotten mad about this and therefore they

167
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,330
put me through this check ball others

168
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,540
said well it's because I'm on a new

169
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,479
device I mistyped my password so I got

170
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,310
this or I was using a VPN and therefore

171
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,840
I got these things and some of these

172
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,790
models could be correct

173
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,219
although the incidents I was studying

174
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,320
had the highest classifier confidence in

175
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,960
actual incidents but some of them still

176
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,490
may have been false husbands other

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,229
participants thought these were true

178
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,240
positive someone was actually trying to

179
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,740
get into the account and in that case

180
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,990
they either thought it was an unknown

181
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,580
attacker or unknown attacker or they

182
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,400
weren't quite sure and I'll get back to

183
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,780
those models in a minute

184
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,000
finally some participants thought this

185
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,849
was a random Security check so something

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,450
like what TSA does at the airport or a

187
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,150
check-up

188
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,710
to make sure the count was okay or maybe

189
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,510
it's because there's been a lot of fake

190
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,940
news issues so they're gonna do this to

191
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,039
everyone these models are not accurate

192
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,960
the the notifications never come up as a

193
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,780
random check but a minority of

194
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,630
participants thought that was the case

195
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,280
okay so there is this causal attribution

196
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,740
process but that wasn't the only thing

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,840
that led to the final mental model of

198
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,060
the incident people also took into

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,219
account their general threat models for

200
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,750
who they thought broadly outside of this

201
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,030
incident might want to get into their

202
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,520
Facebook accounts so this is the WHO and

203
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,979
also the what they might do if they got

204
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,599
into the account and they tended to be

205
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,180
different models depending on whether it

206
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,010
was an unknown or unknown attacker so

207
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,250
some of the models that people expressed

208
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,650
match to models in related literature so

209
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,780
Rick wash has a nice paper in which he

210
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,120
describes different attacker models

211
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,789
including the digital graffiti artist

212
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,260
someone who wants to get in and kind of

213
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,720
screw around with an account to show

214
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,130
that they can and then the burglar

215
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,729
someone who's trying to get in to steal

216
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:22,570
information for monetary gain in our

217
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:25,150
work particularly with the non-western

218
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,630
users we saw additional models so the

219
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,060
spy this is a specifically government or

220
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,700
state actor who's trying to get into the

221
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,950
account in order to find information

222
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,909
about someone criticizing the government

223
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,190
or doing something

224
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,229
excuse me doing something wrong the

225
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,630
snoop someone who's trying to get into

226
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,370
the account they know you say a friend

227
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,630
or a significant other because they want

228
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,660
to know what's going on in your life

229
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,310
without asking you the who else why

230
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,439
would someone who I don't know try to

231
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,819
even get into my account I'm going to

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,430
close off that possibility

233
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,320
and finally the Humiliator which is

234
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,300
similar to the digital graffiti artist

235
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,590
except this person is trying to get into

236
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,020
the

237
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,710
account in order to post things

238
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,140
specifically for the purpose of

239
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,730
humiliating and one of the participants

240
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,470
who had this model said well if someone

241
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,940
was trying to get in and they were just

242
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,340
gonna do funny stuff to prove they could

243
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,370
I'm ok with that but I'm really not okay

244
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,830
if someone's trying to humiliate me ok

245
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,480
so these models influence two people

246
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,240
thought was actually attacking in this

247
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,030
case the other thing that had influence

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,040
was their past experiences so one

249
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,020
participant said well the first time

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,579
that I got the notification I thought it

251
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,100
was someone who's trying to access my

252
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,990
Facebook but after I kept getting this

253
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,070
the next times I realized it was just

254
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,660
them trying to enhance security again

255
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,580
another said well the first time I was

256
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,530
worried but now I understand that this

257
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,060
happens every time I go to a foreign

258
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,150
country so it doesn't have anything to

259
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,400
do with me and this was true even though

260
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,319
for some of these participants prior

261
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,900
incident notification they had gotten

262
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,860
had lower classifier confidence but this

263
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,689
isn't actually visible to the users so

264
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,730
prior experiences that seem to alter

265
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,950
people's mental models only had to do

266
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,900
with Facebook no one said well I get

267
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,670
this a lot on Google and therefore I

268
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,490
don't think it's a big deal here they

269
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,010
seem pretty specific to the platforms

270
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,260
and then these repeated false negatives

271
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,569
if you get them a lot made people quite

272
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,640
likely to disregard the current incident

273
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,890
even if they were different classifier

274
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,220
confidences because as I said this isn't

275
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:32,370
visible to the users okay so together

276
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,560
these create people's mental model and

277
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,650
the vast majority of participants had

278
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,329
plausible plausible mental models but

279
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,810
over half of those mental models were

280
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,670
weak

281
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,469
so they oscillated between different

282
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,939
ones they weren't very confident when

283
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,030
they discussed them they kept changing

284
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,670
their timelines so on and so forth and

285
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,280
this weakness of mental models has a lot

286
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,699
of impact on people's behavior salon

287
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,100
excuse me behavior selection so those

288
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,870
who had a true positive mental model the

289
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,900
majority of those users took a

290
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,490
protective action those who had a false

291
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,470
positive mental model they thought it

292
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,840
was because of something they did very

293
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,460
few of them took an action and those who

294
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,270
kept getting repeated notifications

295
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,580
didn't take an action those who had weak

296
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,760
until models also didn't take an action

297
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,380
most of the time or if they did they

298
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,970
took multiple actions because they

299
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,920
weren't quite sure what to do because

300
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:30,180
they weren't really quite sure what had

301
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,420
actually happened okay so what did they

302
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,829
do when they took an action uh 24 hour

303
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,459
participants so about a third of them

304
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,170
actually took an action and on platform

305
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,720
actions involve doing things like

306
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,670
changing your passwords or settings so

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,200
for example enabling a two-factor

308
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:51,990
authentication or login alerts they also

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,390
involved behaving better so one

310
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,550
participant said well I stopped adding

311
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,650
strangers to my friend list and I

312
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,719
stopped commenting on strangers posts

313
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,689
some of these things may be helpful for

314
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,370
security some of them may not not

315
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,690
necessarily directly related to this

316
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,210
incident where but we're going to kind

317
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,010
of generally behave more compliantly

318
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,680
with what we think the platform wants

319
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,080
and finally participants checked their

320
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,689
accounts for tampering so one said while

321
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,370
I went into my messenger account and I

322
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,080
checked to see if anything had been sent

323
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,880
in deceiving other friends was someone

324
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,430
trying to use the account that's a span

325
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,950
people and checking for tampering

326
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,599
afterward helped inform future mental

327
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,340
models because if I check whether there

328
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,650
was tampering and there wasn't then I'm

329
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,240
more confident if I thought perhaps it

330
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,890
could be a false positive okay a

331
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,110
minority of participants then took an

332
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,390
off platform action so they went beyond

333
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,520
just changing something on Facebook to

334
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:50,040
change something on another platform and

335
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,480
these behaviors included changing to

336
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,860
novel new passwords on other accounts

337
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,760
improving your security posture so

338
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,530
changing some settings on other accounts

339
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,350
and also some potentially insecure

340
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,750
changes so some participants said well I

341
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,460
think this happened because I mistyped

342
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,710
my password so I'm gonna just start

343
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,140
saving my password from the browser or

344
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,760
maybe I'm going to change my passwords

345
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,860
on other accounts to be more similar to

346
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,920
my Facebook account so that this doesn't

347
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,050
happen to me again or perhaps I will

348
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,390
start avoiding using a VPN so I don't

349
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,890
get put into this checkpoint so there's

350
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,840
this flipside where these notifications

351
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,370
if I think it's because of something I

352
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,710
did

353
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,220
I can lead me to try to stop doing that

354
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,230
thing so this doesn't happen and finally

355
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,300
some participants made sort of vague

356
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,520
efforts toward vigilance I'm gonna be

357
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,829
more careful on my email now to that

358
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,839
this has happened and when we probe them

359
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,580
about what does more careful mean you

360
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,710
get sort of some hand wavy things about

361
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,330
like being you know more aware of what's

362
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:55,490
going on on the inbox okay uh so there's

363
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,220
a number of influences throughout this

364
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,930
process from information seeking I don't

365
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,760
have time to cover them here so I point

366
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,040
you to the paper but one of the

367
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,900
interesting findings is that there are

368
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,939
different motivations for information

369
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,620
seeking including camaraderie I want to

370
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,950
know other people who have gone through

371
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,050
one of these incidents finally we see

372
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,839
influence from culture so how does

373
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,359
culture influence this process at least

374
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,640
ah influences based on degree of

375
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,089
internet censorship degree of

376
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:29,569
collectivism and also different uses of

377
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:31,790
Facebook so those who are in censored

378
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,740
countries we're more likely to have

379
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,110
threat models that focused on government

380
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,330
surveillance and that changed their

381
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,730
mental models of what happens when they

382
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,900
got this notification as well as whether

383
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,030
they thought they could defend

384
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,640
themselves so if I think that there is

385
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,150
an all-powerful state actor attacking my

386
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,730
account

387
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,530
it may seem pointless to try to make

388
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,970
changes to say my password or other

389
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,860
settings collectivistic countries as

390
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,260
measured by some of the hostage indices

391
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,660
the threat models there tended to focus

392
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,730
on known attackers and there are also

393
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,010
different information seeking behaviors

394
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,350
so those from these countries were more

395
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,270
likely to seek out information from

396
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,140
people that they knew versus googling

397
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,130
online or going to Facebook health pages

398
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,839
additionally they may have different

399
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,839
feelings about the incident

400
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,910
so one participant said well if if

401
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,220
really an attacker had got in I would

402
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,170
feel that someone was violating me and I

403
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,089
wouldn't know what to do because I

404
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,010
wouldn't be able to do anything to

405
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:33,440
recover because the very fact that they

406
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,390
got in would be the thing that was a

407
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,980
problem not whatever they did when they

408
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,930
were in there finally we saw that those

409
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,850
from different countries had

410
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,010
different variations in their facebook

411
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,339
usage and this is true on a quantitative

412
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,649
scale as well and the type of Facebook

413
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,779
use influence both threat models and

414
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,760
defenses so if I'm using my Facebook to

415
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,640
run a business how I want to defend

416
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,620
myself and also who I think is getting

417
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,300
in and why is gonna look a little bit

418
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,029
different than if I only use this to

419
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,339
sort of scroll through news

420
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:09,250
interestingly skill didn't come up so

421
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,720
the main thing we often talk about in

422
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,240
cross-cultural work is differences in

423
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,209
internet penetration and skill now skill

424
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,310
may not have come up and by not come up

425
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,099
I mean no one said well I didn't do of

426
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,449
defense because I wasn't sure how to

427
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,920
very few people were nervous about

428
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,230
whether they could do the secondary

429
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,270
authentication task and this is probably

430
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,490
the case because to participate in the

431
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,380
interviews you needed to be sufficiently

432
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,330
technically savvy to go through like the

433
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,180
email scheduling process and so forth

434
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,190
the advantage of skill not coming up is

435
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,839
it allowed us to see some of these other

436
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,580
nuances which might otherwise be

437
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,450
overshadowed by kind of skill or

438
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,640
penetration differences so what does

439
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,850
this tell us about moving forward with

440
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,830
incident response so weak mental models

441
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,110
make it unlikely that users will take

442
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:00,050
action or that they will take effective

443
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,670
action one of the things that we are not

444
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,890
currently doing is we're not doing any

445
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,109
causal modeling to try to help people

446
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,689
figure out what went on we have a bunch

447
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,159
of signals to tell us yes we have X

448
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,530
percent confidence that this was an

449
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,270
incident but we don't use those signals

450
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,579
to try to figure out what happened and

451
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:20,449
make that transparent to help the users

452
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,459
figure it out - of course repeated false

453
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,800
positives make it hard to regain user

454
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,110
attention we know this from a lot of

455
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,530
usable security work on warning messages

456
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:33,559
and so forth it may be helpful to give

457
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,110
some indication of classifier confidence

458
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,300
so if this is a very confident alert vs.

459
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,129
are not very confident alert make a UI

460
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,510
distinction because otherwise it looks

461
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,480
like the same alert I've gotten a

462
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,520
hundred times for using a VPN in the

463
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,130
future we're starting to explore

464
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,809
creating structured feedback mechanisms

465
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,030
so that users can provide information

466
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,430
about their threat models or what they

467
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,889
think happened to the classifiers weak

468
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,960
validate this with log data and then

469
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,320
begin to train better classification for

470
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,170
incidents for individual users and

471
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,100
finally this work on non-western

472
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,880
cultures supports existing work on

473
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,100
marginalized groups like domestic

474
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,590
violence victims for whom known

475
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,899
attackers are very important and defense

476
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,240
mechanisms like identifying pictures of

477
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,610
friends or people you've recently talked

478
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,640
to you may not be overly helpful in the

479
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:32,659
case of people that you know thank you

480
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:34,220
and happy to take questions now if you

481
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,480
have any questions please come up to the

482
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:45,730
microphone state your name and

483
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:45,730
affiliation we don't have time forever

484
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,970
Delft I saw that you mostly clustered

485
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,100
based on like the high level cultural

486
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,980
dimensions so basically type 1 register

487
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,959
2 cultures do you think that a further

488
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,330
investigation of the individual six

489
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,040
dimensions of host data might yield

490
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:11,689
further insight yeah um yes I think so I

491
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,310
think with the sample size here

492
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,470
sometimes it's a little bit hard to

493
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,300
gotee it's just because then we start to

494
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,610
wonder well is this the individual or is

495
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,770
it selected for the culture right and we

496
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,740
did only specific cities in each of

497
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,360
these countries to avoid some of that

498
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,760
these were the largest effects that I

499
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,899
could see qualitatively but I in the

500
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,370
future would like to do some

501
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:37,340
quantitative work to look at those more

502
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:39,080
carefully yeah hi my name is Dina for

503
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,500
the ferry commission thank you for the

504
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,330
talk I was wondering in the mental

505
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,070
models people responded by changing

506
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,629
their passwords but did anyone ever

507
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,550
think about what they haven't done I

508
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,650
mean he talked about how there are some

509
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,750
false positives as an people about that

510
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,580
they might be using new devices but also

511
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,230
other things like maybe people haven't

512
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,610
changed their phone number that might be

513
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,580
associated with their account and

514
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,770
Facebook uses magic like

515
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,570
so if you click on a link you're

516
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,940
automatically logged in even though the

517
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,960
phone number longer belongs to you yeah

518
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,820
that's a really good point

519
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,490
none of them brought that up my

520
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,290
suspicion is I think it seemed like

521
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,800
there was sort of a reflexive training

522
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,230
of like Oh login password had to do

523
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,340
different login change password and it

524
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,720
would be interesting to see if we

525
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,580
brought that up to them sort of what the

526
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,270
reaction would be yes absolutely thank

527
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,189
you very much

528
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,540
awesome thank you very much Alyssa and

529
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:35,660
let's give her another hand of applause

530
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:35,659
