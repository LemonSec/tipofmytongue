1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,820
Grafton everyone my name is Wu

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,520
it's my great honor to present our

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,070
research work profiler on the fly the

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,349
input type probing technique for better

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,790
yellow they were ability detection and

6
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:26,279
this is a joint work from Purdue

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:36,180
University Indiana University and the

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:42,710
University of China actually I found

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:47,100
that work to move to the next page i

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:50,100
okay it was not and the first let me

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,379
give a brief introduction tree nutrition

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,540
based opposing it's that flower stand

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,879
all valley the input instance as the

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,729
input and the continuously modifies

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,790
named chicks problems its execution

16
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,700
paths and in each for the iteration an

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,729
input is selected flounder seat covers

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,860
for random mutations and the utility

19
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,020
includes executed on the target

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,680
application and the code coverage are

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,990
traced and the lowest neutrality input

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,600
the increased code courage are saved

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,850
into the seed Cooper's for further

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,320
mutation but unfortunately our brand

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,559
early lamented mutations not that

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,690
effective we use AFL the most popular

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,810
mutation based the father to first open

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,810
jpg for 24 hours and we observed natural

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,320
morning 60% of new mutations are

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,510
performed on the input bites they are

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,509
effective as presented in this figure

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,950
whose x axis labels each individual bite

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,810
of the input and the y axis shows the

34
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,200
number of mutations performed on each

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,600
page so here we observe nature more than

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,060
1.5 million mutations that performed

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,329
only so the first bites which is

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:14,700
effective for coverage improvement and

39
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,530
another observation is natural the

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,890
effectively mutation ratio drops very

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,020
quickly the u-33 mutation ratio is muted

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,779
by the number of mutations

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,090
increase courage over the number of

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,390
total mutations as presented in this

45
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,460
figure whose access it's armed

46
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,070
it stands for the our spending passing

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,930
and the y-axis which stands for the

48
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,500
effectively mutation ratio changes a

49
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,600
long time and we can see that new code

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:49,020
coverage is hardly improved after eight

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:51,480
hours and the existing works improved

52
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,520
buzzing on both press and tabs on the

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,649
one hand different seed selection and

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,190
prioritization algorithms are proposed

55
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,070
to help cover as more program code as

56
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,420
possible given our limited budget and on

57
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,060
the other hand the multiple program

58
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,480
analysis such as tendonitis symbolic

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,450
Scotian or gradient based search are

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,899
proposed to integrated responding to

61
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,989
reach program policies that need to

62
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,820
satisfy the specific condition so this

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,880
works art has improved the effect needs

64
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,940
of buzzing choose an extent however some

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,160
highly a more highly effective buzzing

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,829
requires in-depth knowledge of the

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,470
target programs input so on this

68
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,630
motivates our work of Professor which

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,010
performs an on-the-fly input structure

70
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,630
understanding and utilizing a two-stage

71
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,660
fault in process so in the first stage

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,510
the types of the input field are

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,210
approved in a lightweight manner there

74
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,519
consists of three steps including

75
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,810
provide mutation observation field

76
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,850
identification and type discovery and in

77
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,150
the second stage it hype informations

78
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,609
marriages to explore vary the values for

79
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,700
better code coverage and exploit

80
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,360
specific values namely to vulnerability

81
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,149
so we should note here that the types

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,180
discuss here are occasional stick types

83
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,250
such as letter size which are critically

84
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,350
important for falling instead of nodes

85
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,630
or application specific types such as

86
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,640
the IP address or PDF data structures

87
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:31,919
and so on and we identify the 6,000

88
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,669
related input types including assertion

89
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,280
rotator enumeration of set size and loop

90
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,470
and least hives covered mostly input

91
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,590
content for popular applications and

92
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,060
eternal effects a professor program

93
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,450
security in a unique way

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,170
so are we taken in emulation incises the

95
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,840
samples an input field of enumeration

96
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:58,110
type has a small set of valid values

97
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,210
with other values causing the program to

98
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,000
terminate with exception here we show a

99
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,979
close neighborhood of open G pack for

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,060
assessing an enumeration field the

101
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,350
indicator color maps as we can see alarm

102
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,480
operative help support for different

103
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,920
color tags each corresponding to a

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,490
different handling function and input

105
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,140
field of precise type determines the

106
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,790
amount of data and the program should

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,010
read from the input for further

108
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,830
processing so here is no code snippet

109
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,289
from open G pack for possessing a side

110
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,510
field that indicates the image height so

111
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,600
as we can see that the program will

112
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:39,300
terminate the luxury if the input file

113
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,610
is not lengthy enough as indicated by a

114
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,250
new science field so input field are

115
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,070
automatically discovered via byte wise

116
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,020
mutations and analyzing impacts of the

117
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,230
individual mutated buys only program

118
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,900
exclusions so specifically given a seed

119
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:02,820
input provider mutates one part at a

120
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,039
time in liberating only 256 values of no

121
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,640
bite to collect the corresponding

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,160
solution profiles so an excursion

123
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,349
profile is no trace difference between

124
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,980
the extrusion with the original input

125
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:20,400
and institution with new mutated input

126
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,650
and after observing prepared mutation

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,630
effects with Clube consecutive bites

128
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,830
nash share similar fusion profiles

129
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:31,920
together as an input field for example

130
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,260
the Zillow and the first device composed

131
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,690
group since they share similar skills

132
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,180
and profiles while on the second byte

133
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,010
start another group since its exclusion

134
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,770
profiles are totally different from the

135
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:48,770
previous bites so only intrusions

136
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,610
so the intrusions are behind this

137
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,200
naturally program tends to perform

138
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,610
validation check our whole input field

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,430
instead of individual bytes

140
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,740
hence efforts and consecutive parts

141
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,990
belong to a same field it is very likely

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,750
that this year a large part of their

143
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:14,730
execution profiles natural corresponding

144
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:17,310
to invalid ability to values as an

145
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,990
example the zeros and first part of the

146
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,000
input are simultaneously checked by a

147
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,340
scintilla see is them by a check against

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,760
the cost of value here we shown a

149
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,700
profile on similarity graph of

150
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,349
mischievous whose excesses enumerates

151
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,810
all the possible values from the bite

152
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,400
and the y axis shields no similarity

153
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,370
between the original execution and

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,669
imitated execution as we can see in a

155
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,890
post bias has only one valid value whose

156
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,500
corresponding similarity score is 1 and

157
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,930
the other invalid values to lead to

158
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,780
determination of program health has a

159
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,720
very low similarity score so this chip I

160
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,929
share the same minimal similarity since

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:05,090
they have the same termination pass with

162
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,090
no exception so we group them together

163
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,180
given a group of consecutive parts as an

164
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,760
input field the next step is to

165
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,130
determine the type of no field once

166
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,420
again we use the enumeration and sidon

167
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:24,270
examples and following enumeration field

168
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,220
there is a proper subset of all it's

169
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,289
possible values such nature for any

170
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,480
value in this subset it's the middle D

171
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,390
score is larger than the mid-range and

172
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,730
for any others not in the subset its

173
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,480
molarity score estimate is smaller than

174
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:42,600
the mid-range so assume a no profile

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,790
linearity graph of need 28 bytes which

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,880
is an enumeration field there are

177
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,890
forwarded o values namely no program

178
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,230
move forward hence have a relatively

179
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,150
high technology score while other

180
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,840
invalid values need no program

181
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,360

183
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:06,840
long now let's move to nur of field side

184
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,730
aside field so first at field near is

185
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,410
this abound such net different values

186
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,450
within the bound corresponds to

187
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,270
different similarity scores larger

188
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,370
nanometer range and for any value piano

189
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,800
bound its similarity score is smaller

190
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,040
than a big range so as shown in the

191
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,859
profile similarly graph of this twenty

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,290
second bytes which is the side field not

193
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,140
net value Qiu is not bound as we use a

194
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,510
very small image as an input and the in

195
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,090
and the value smaller nano parent have a

196
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,260
relatively high tonality score since the

197
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,610
input is lengthy enough the amount of

198
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,280
data should be read for further

199
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,540
processing and well the values larger

200
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:53,339

Philip Adams the type of each field is

204
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,210
identified we use different legends to

205
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,219
mark different types of field in this

206
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:12,470
figure as we can see we have six kind of

207
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,470
types of field and they are identified

208
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,860
and it have information is used for

209
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,530
guide full of mutations the guidance is

210
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,200
provided in two aspects in the first act

211
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,959
aspects in image new mutation to honor

212
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,660
valley the values of the field type to

213
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,660
achieve better courage as an instance

214
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:42,449
for size for size field where mutation

215
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,760
increase its valuable acts it also

216
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:52,290
opened as part of data and the end of

217
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:54,870
the file and in the second aspect

218
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,089
Professor X provides a set of special

219
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,780
values namely to potential vulnerability

220
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,930
as an instance for size is for size

221
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,270
field we will try to force its value to

222
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,109
be

223
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:11,250
difference between the end of file and

224
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,900
in color location which may result in

225
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:21,160
buffer will flow if the program does not

226
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:24,340
properly handle expected values and we

227
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,870
evaluated it we conducted a set of

228
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,820
experiments to evaluate the

229
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,890
effectiveness and the efficiency of Pro

230
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,270
father due to tie name it we were

231
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:36,850
presented fall of non here so the first

232
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,220
one is is no probing accuracy which

233
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,170
measures whether profiler can actually

234
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,470
identify fields and their types through

235
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,990
probing we acquired the ground shoes by

236
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,390
manually checking how applications

237
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,370
handle individual parts and then compare

238
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,220
the probing results with Neutron choose

239
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:57,250
to measure false positive rates and the

240
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,920
new false negative rates by professor we

241
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,650
also compare privado with AFL analyzes a

242
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,349
simple of nine file formats analyzing

243
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,270
utility included in AFL so the

244
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,550
evaluation Asian resolution Snell Pro

245
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,220
father has only around the five percent

246
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,760
false positive rate and false negative

247
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,760
rate on average while AFL analysis has

248
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,770
along forty percent false positive rate

249
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:25,660
and seventy percent false negative rate

250
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:27,160
which is relatively high and the second

251
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,620
one is no funding zero day

252
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,360

253
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,790
extensively tested real-world

254
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,950

260
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,420
the third one is the evaluation on

261
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,680
standard benchmarks we performed we

262
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,930
compare poor father with

263
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,920
state-of-the-art buzzing tools including

264
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,130

faceted search to see whether they can

267
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,400
reach the specified code locations and

268
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,920
the evaluation results show that

269
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,319
provider can reach more tacky locations

270
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,810
and is two to eight times faster than

271
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,970
other fathers and the first one is the

272
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,189
performance compare

273
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,649
our fathers so as we can see natural

274
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:24,779
professor trees small paskevich and

275
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:26,910
other fathers and spends less time to

276
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,540
reach in the stem courage decides

277
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:36,480
professor keeps relatively on high

278
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:37,740
effective mutation ratio finally are we

279
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,430
discussing the differences between

280
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,379
professor and closely related walks sir

281
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,199
early studies reverse engineering the

282
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,269

283
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,199
using simple execution type of location

284
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:55,410
or memory of cells pattern analyzes and

285
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,689
recently this research is on field aware

286
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,389
fuzzing are emerging the intercept

288
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:06,930

291
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,519
different flawless works professor

292
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:17,069
includes a live image hydrogen to

293
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,350
discover the relations between input

294
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,180
bytes and program behaviors by observing

295
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,269
the program execution paths or

296
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,729
violations in response to mutations of

297
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:29,069
this input content so instead of using

298
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,170
heavy weights a program analysis

299
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:34,649
technique such as tend analysis or

300
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,719
simple execution in addiction the info

301
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:39,750
type of by professor is application

302
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:45,389
agnostic and the fashion related instead

303
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:46,920
of the program specific so in conclusion

304
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,930
we propose a technique

305
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,110
nelle average only flight type learning

306
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:55,469
to improve fouling the basic idea is to

307
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,959
probe input fields and types by

308
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,850
observing the importing process and the

309
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,550
Larry gene with hive information to

310
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,309
explore more program passes and exploit

311
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,469
the potential vulnerabilities based on

312
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:09,480
the proposed technique were implemented

313
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,759
a proper type system called provider and

314
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,680
the evaluation results indicating that

315
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,139
the professor has a better performance

316
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,120
of post code courage and vulnerability

317
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:22,889
exposure it is covered for the 2-0 days

318
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,620
vulnerabilities assists 30 of which are

319
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,110
assigned with CVS the source code of

320
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,810
professor will be released on the github

321
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,640
and that is the end of my brilliant

322
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,520
thank you for your attendance and I'm

323
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:40,529
happy to take any questions thank you

324
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,490
[Applause]

325
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,600
she was the microphone and state your

326
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,940
name and affiliation

327
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,660
Christina in sarataro Northeastern

328
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:52,450
University so first an observation there

329
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:56,650
is some work in filing protocols myself

330
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:59,110
included where we actually use types in

331
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,720
order to speed up you know coverage

332
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,570
speed up and also improve coverage but

333
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,940
my question is you show that your

334
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,790
technique improves over several other

335
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,830
Pfizer's do you have any idea where is

336
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,680
that improvement coming from for example

337
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,800
you are identifying several types maybe

338
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,069
all your improvement comes from one type

339
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,760
so also no improvement transplant to

340
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:27,100
expert the first experts is natural we

341
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:31,360
ignore or eliminate some unnecessary

342
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,100
type of mutations on net a no-go

343
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,940
Speights whose mutation is not

344
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,980
ineffective such as loaded her Austrian

345
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,610
because natural any mutations on these

346
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,940
two parts has no helpful for improve no

347
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:49,390
no no garbage right from the auditor and

348
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,330
assertion and and the other expert scans

349
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,420
flow we focused our more effort on

350
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,150
fuzzing or mutation waste net loss of

351
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,910
validator value for example from the

352
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,010
enumeration field we only mutated them

353
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,189
with nee relative value and they were

354
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,980
making a program move forward and we

355
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,569
don't funding with no net well we

356
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,390
tumbled head waste net in value value

357
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,889
and that will cause the program

358
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,780
terminate immediately so I think the

359
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,900
improvement comes from is Chu experts

360
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,459
what is economic loss in effective

361
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,230
invitations the other is focused our

362
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:29,380
mutation on those effective ones

363
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:33,010
thank you nice work I'm doing Fran

364
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,590
Stevens I saw you compare your your work

365
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,400
with tens analysis based works like

366
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,129
angora

367
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,240
do you have any evaluation comparison

368
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,080
between professor and ER and coral I do

369
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,510
understand that

370
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,779
when your paper is accepted and coral

371
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:53,360
may not be open source at that time but

372
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:56,240
do you have evaluation results by now

373
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,639
yeah since my suggestion and and the

374
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,760
Association is also not one in our PC

375
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,890
our reviewers to just ask to do and the

376
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,010
time of our writing of this paper at

377
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,200
Angola is not released the so we we have

378
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,649
asked for users and then and the

379
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,380
necessary they have cut released them

380
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:18,620
recently so on we haven't got time to

381
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,340
compare our to always know and Cora and

382
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,590
I think we were just the start to make

383
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,510
it as our official present you compare

384
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,209
then yeah yeah thanks for the

385
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,370
information to sir 1 Mussina's so the

386
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,120
tension analysis iing and gore oh it's

387
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:38,809
quite efficient actually so you may want

388
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,199
to give it a try thanks I think the

389
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,200
speaker again

390
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,349
[Applause]
