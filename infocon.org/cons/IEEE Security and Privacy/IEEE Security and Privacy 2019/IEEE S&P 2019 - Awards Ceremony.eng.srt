1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:16,290
all right welcome to the second day of

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,630
the conference and the award ceremony

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,299
this morning it's my pleasure to welcome

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,610
you back to the conference together with

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,790
Hova we will handing out the number of

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:30,119
awards specifically there will be three

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,970
categories one is the awards for the

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,760
best reviewers of course program

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,910
committee members spend a lot of time

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,500
writing a lot of reviews and we want to

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,589
recognize and award or give them a token

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,870
of recognition for their hard work and

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:52,019
then we move on to the distinguished

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,019
practical paper award and finally to the

15
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:58,230
distinguished paper award so I guess

16
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,879
let's jump right into this as we have I

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,730
think done always at Oakland

18
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,370
we don't inform everyone or anyone

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,979
rather that the are the winners of the

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,590
award so that has one great advantage

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,660
there's suspense it has one big

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,040
disadvantage people might not be in the

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,280
room and when they actually get their

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,560
word so we hope that we fully capitalize

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,090
on the advantages but avoid the

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,820
disadvantages by having those folks

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,560
actually in the room and well just to

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,320
get started we start with the

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,590
distinguished to review awards we gave

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,529
them out for for those PC members who

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,110
were writing a lot of reviews a lot of

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,340
high quality reviews who were engaged in

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,160
the discussions and conversations and

34
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,620
well also cheerfully champion as Brian I

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,590
think said last year when we were asking

36
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,730
them for some last minute assignment and

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,560
of course they're always some

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,340
last-minute assignments so without

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,460
further ado we have four awardees we

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,830
have Manos antenna khakis marina Blanton

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,899
Michelle Masaryk and Mattias payer if

42
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,140
you're here please come up to the stage

43

yes we have one so that's awesome well

46

thank you I think there will be pictures

48
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,269
so I think you have to hold it

49
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:39,580
you have hope of somewhere in there

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,580
[Music]

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:51,870
awkward picture but thank you very much

52
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:54,389
appreciate it if you guys see any of the

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,819
other awardees please let them know that

54
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,189
they can pick up their certificate at

55
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,899
the registration desk afterwards what

56
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,840
just let me or mark no one will make

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,260
sure that you get that award all right

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,699
so with that we are moving to our second

59
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,510
and third award which is the

60
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:15,659
distinguished papers we had a two step

61
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,179
process for that I think somewhat

62
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,179
similar to previous years where we first

63
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,159
selected a pool of candidates those pool

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,370
of candidate papers were selected based

65
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,638
on their scores so the average scores

66
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,500
from the reviews as well as additional

67
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,870
recommendations or suggestions from PC

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,199
members and and then we took those

69
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,979
papers and we put them up for a vote all

70
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:44,310
PC members were eligible to vote and we

71
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:48,000
asked them to nominate between one and

72
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,359
three of their top choices and and then

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,729
we just tell it up and a fairly clear

74
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,889
picture emerged so it was a very easy to

75
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,310
do the actual selection we actually had

76
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,689
44 votes that were cast which was very

77
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,689
happy because you know it's it's it's

78
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:06,120
essentially half of the PC voted which I

79
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,189
think makes this really as strong a

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,340
strong vote and make sure that these

81
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,108
papers you know have not just been voted

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,449
by okay one paper got three the other

83
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:19,639
got four votes no they basically were

84
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:22,380
really solidly and strongly voted for

85
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,740
alright with that the first one is the

86
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,810
DC

87
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,520
which practical paper award it's an

88
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,699
award that was sponsored by Microsoft

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,948
and I'm very happy to announce that it

90
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,720
was won by exploiting correcting codes

91
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:39,030
on the effectiveness of ECC memory

92
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:42,120
against row hammer attacks if you have

93
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,599

practical paper award was in the first

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,350
session on hard work very exciting work

108
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,719
on both the practical aspects of

109
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,850
attacking systems as well as some some

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,150

111
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:59,139
second part is the distinguished paper

112
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,659
award and that was one with probably

113
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,419
more than two-thirds of the votes which

114
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,450
goes to Spectre attacks exploiting

115
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:10,479
