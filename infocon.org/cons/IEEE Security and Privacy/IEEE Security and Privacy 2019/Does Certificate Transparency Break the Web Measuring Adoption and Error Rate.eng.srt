1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,719
hello good afternoon hope everyone had a

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,160
good lunch as men well said my name is

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,230
Emily stark I'm here from the chrome

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,430
security team and I'm gonna be talking

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,070
about work that I've done with

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:26,989
collaborators at Google and University

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,500
of Sarajevo and CloudFlare so imagine

8
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:32,360
that one day you go on the web to your

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,750
favorite search engine and you see a

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,790
security error like this you might think

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,110
that's pretty weird it's not every day

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,780
you see an error like this on a major

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,180
search engine but maybe you go about

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,010
your business and later that day you see

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,620
the same error on your bank website when

16
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,760
you're trying to pay some bills and then

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,199
you start to think things are a little

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,059
weird you go try to figure out what's

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,680
wrong and as you try to see what's up

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,990
with all these sick area security errors

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,579
you find the same error on some of your

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:04,100
favorite news websites and tech blogs

23
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:06,590
over the last several years a system

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,880
called certificate transparency has been

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,430
in the process of being rolled out

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,710
across the internet and if things have

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,630
gone wrong it could have resulted in an

28
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,509
experience like I just described for

29
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,970
millions or maybe even billions of users

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:24,200
with these scary arab pages on lots of

31
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:28,670
websites across the internet uh-oh my

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,380
slides are gone oh well so but instead

33
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,070
with the exception of a few kind of a

34
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,020
few hiccups the deployment of CT has

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,839
gone pretty much unnoticed by end-users

36
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,610
and in the process it's brought about a

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,710
pretty big improvement in the security

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,740
of the web by bringing accountability

39
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:50,059
and transparency into the issuance of

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,140
HTTPS certificates this paper that I'm

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,000
going to talk to you about today is a

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,640
measurement study of how CT has been

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,890
deployed in the real world looking at

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,630
things like its adoption and compliance

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,170
over time from different perspectives

46
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,880
and focusing on the end user impact in

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,140
terms of how much breakage or errors

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,939
users experience as a result of CT there

49
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,619
were many interesting design decisions

50
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,409
and a lot of nuance that went into the

51
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,239
deployment of CT and in the paper we

52
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:19,159
look at what what made those decisions

53
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,160
successful or unsuccessful and what the

54
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:26,769
lessons might be for future similar

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,510
stems in the first part of the talk if

56
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,550
you're wondering what this whole CT

57
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,470
thing is about I'll give you a little

58
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,510
bit of background about what CT is and

59
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,420
what some of the data sources are that

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,370
we use to measure it then I'll talk

61
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,320
about some of the metrics that we looked

62
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,030
at and in particular our metric of

63
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,850
interest is called the CT compliance

64
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,590
rate and finally I'll talk about some of

65
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,390
the aspects of CT that proved quite

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,390
challenging to deploy in the real world

67
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,800
so I'm not gonna go into a huge amount

68
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,359
of detail about what CT is so that I

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,820
have more time to talk about its

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,630
real-world deployment but at a very high

71
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,030
level CT is designed to enable the rapid

72
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:11,049
discovery of malicious or miss issued

73
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,810
certificates it's a system of public

74
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,090
cryptographically auditable logs which

75
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,240
are run by different stakeholders in in

76
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,150
the HTTP ecosystem so for example CAS or

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,190
browser vendors when certificates are

78
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,860
issued they get inserted into these logs

79
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,540
and the result from the log is so it's

80
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,680
called a signed certificate timestamp or

81
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:36,130
SCT and these SATs can be thought of as

82
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,459
verifiable promises that the certificate

83
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,560
will appear in this log so the end goal

84
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,170
of CT is eventually all certificates

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,420
come with these s CTS and all browsers

86
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,399
should verify these s CTS so that

87
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,410
certificates are only treated as trusted

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,910
if they have been logged in CT logs and

89
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,150
even though it isn't fully deployed yet

90
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,579
CT has already been a pretty big had a

91
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,980
pretty big effect on the HTTP ecosystem

92
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,660
discovering allowing auditors to

93
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,459
discover Mis issuances and other

94
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:13,390
issuance practices that need to be

95
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:15,760
corrected now as I mentioned CT is not

96
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,529
fully deployed and it's been in the

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,480
process of being deployed over many

98
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,918
years now and the point of this slide is

99
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,450
not that you should read everything on

100
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,760
it but that there have been all these

101
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,340
all these milestones in the deployment

102
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,560
of CT over several years so there has

103
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,109
not been and there will not be one major

104
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,540
flag day where a CT is required for all

105
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,550
websites by all browsers B

106
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,070
in practice that would likely lead to a

107
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,780
lot of errors and breakage so it's

108
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,840
instead it's been this this gradual

109
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,969
process of deployment and in the paper

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,070
we focus on how deployment has rolled

111
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,690
out in the Chrome web browser and we

112
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,969
focus on Chrome for two reasons

113
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,530
one is that we had access to telemetry

114
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,300
data from Chrome that we could use to

115
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,619
measure CTS adoption and the second

116
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,420
reason is that at the time of writing

117
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,150
chrome had the most advanced CT

118
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,850
implementation but since then Safari has

119
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,310
deployed a CT implementation and Firefox

120
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,800
also implements CT partially though it's

121
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,800
not not enabled by default in production

122
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,750
so in this work we measured CTS adoption

123
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,150
from a variety of different perspectives

124
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,910
and time periods our primary data source

125
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,640
as I mentioned was telemetry from Chrome

126
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,920
users but we also did some active scans

127
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,140
of popular websites and we did that to

128
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,260
characterize server-side support for CT

129
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,360
and we also did a qualitative analysis

130
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,940
of data from the chrome help forums

131
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,190
where we looked at users posting posting

132
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,840
help forum threads about CT errors that

133
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,300
they encounter so that we could try to

134
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:52,869
understand how they how they perceive

135
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:54,190
and understand CT related breakage so

136
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,320
the first question that we asked

137
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:03,880
ourselves in this work was how widely

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:05,950
has CT been adopted we found that at the

139
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,040
time of our measurements CT was

140
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:12,039
supported on 71% of HTTP requests in

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,980
Chrome so we thought this was pretty

142
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,950
cool because at this time CT was not

143
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,260
required for nearly this much traffic so

144
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,719
CT had been pretty widely adopted even

145
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,610
before it was required and in the paper

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,420
we do some analysis of why that is for

147
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,160
example 1600 of the Alexa top 10,000

148
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,830
supported CTS simply because they were

149
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,730
behind CloudFlare and CloudFlare enabled

150
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,820
CT for all of its websites by default

151
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:42,400
even though it wasn't required to this

152
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,700
adoption metric is what a lot of

153
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,380
previous work focuses on but we looked

154
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,250
at a different metric as our main metric

155
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,310
of interest and

156
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,080
what we called the CT compliance rate

157
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,330
the compliance rate is saying when

158
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,859
chrome requires a site to support CT

159
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,090
does it actually comply successfully and

160
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,740
the reason that this is our metric of

161
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,020
interest is because this is what

162
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,000
translates to end-user impact when a

163
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,020
site is required to support CT but is

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,120
not compliant

165
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,120
that's when users see breakage or errors

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,970
our main finding here was that at the

167
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,680
time of our measurements CT compliance

168
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,750
was quite high ninety-nine point seven

169
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:28,360
percent of the time that chrome required

170
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:30,640
a site to be CT compliant it was so

171
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,950
that's pretty good but I want to dive

172
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,140
into this a little bit more deeply and

173
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:39,570
convince you of a few interesting

174
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:41,820
properties of the CT compliance metric

175
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,870
first I want to convince you that

176
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,400
compliance is actually something we

177
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,419
should care about because low compliance

178
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,400
would be very very bad so just to remind

179
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,229
you comply low compliance means that

180
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,179
sites are not supporting CT when they're

181
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,750
required to meaning that users see

182
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,400
breakage or errors on those sites so

183
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,960
security errors like I showed at the

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,520
beginning of this talk are generally a

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,140
bad user experience there's lots of

186
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,080
prior research about why we want to try

187
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,450
to avoid security errors but they also

188
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,320
turn out to be particularly bad in the

189
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,580
case of CT when they're caused by CT so

190
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,490
for example we found that even though

191
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,169
these CT errors are pretty rare users

192
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,750
react to them badly they click through

193
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:23,950
them they ignore the error and proceed

194
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,200
to the site even though they're being

195
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,260
warned not to do that twice as often as

196
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,060
they do with certificate errors overall

197
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,130
and we try to avoid error click through

198
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,890
security error click through because it

199
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,059
is an indicator of users learning to

200
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:43,449
click through security errors and

201
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:45,699
becoming habituated to them we also

202
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,589
found that when we looked at help forum

203
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,720
posts about users encountering these CT

204
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,490
eras sixty percent of the time there was

205
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,730
an incorrect solution or explanation

206
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,550
attached to them and so in some cases

207
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,080
users are actually taking damaging or

208
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,760
destructive action to try to get around

209
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,590
these errors like clearing settings

210
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,569
disabling

211
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,410
extensions in some cases because can

212
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,540
actually be security negative actions

213
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,520
and we looked at the top ten websites

214
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,980
that are causing sea tiaras in Chrome

215
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,540
from our telemetry data and we

216
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,160
categorized them and found some pretty

217
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,439
upsetting categories like government

218
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,540
portables financial services these are

219
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,310
very important security sensitive sites

220
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,810
that users are encountering these errors

221
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:30,390
on so altogether we have security errors

222
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,339
caused by CT on important sites that

223
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,720
users don't understand don't understand

224
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,490
why they're happening or how to fix them

225
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,410
and that they're clicking through at a

226
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,990
much higher rate than certificate errors

227
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,540
overall so those are the reasons that we

228
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:47,430
particularly care about CT compliance as

229
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:49,199
a metric now the other thing that I want

230
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,400
to convince you of about CT compliance

231
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,170
is that it shouldn't be taken for

232
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,510
granted it's not automatically going to

233
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,829
be high just because Chrome says CT is

234
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,210
required for this website

235
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:02,490
doesn't mean that the website is going

236
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:04,860
to comply so we've seen several examples

237
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,910
of CAS or sites just implementing CT

238
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,040
incorrectly one example of this is in

239
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:14,189
2016 chrome began requiring CT for the

240
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,370
Symantec CA due to a pattern of CA

241
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:20,520
misbehavior when this requirement went

242
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,560
into effect Symantec offered this sort

243
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,750
of custom version of CT that wasn't

244
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,599
supported by browsers and they offered

245
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,460
this aimed at enterprise private domains

246
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,600
that didn't want their domain names to

247
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,180
appear publicly in CT logs unfortunately

248
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,420
a number of public popular websites

249
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,229
chose this option as well as

250
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,910
unintentionally and that resulted in

251
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,790
those sites temporarily breaking in

252
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,050
Chrome so this is an example of CT gone

253
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,880
wrong the kind of thing that can happen

254
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,329
that can actually cause compliance to

255
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,910
dip and this wasn't an isolated incident

256
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,150
we looked later on a couple years later

257
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,250
at the top web sites that were causing C

258
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,810
Tierra's in chrome and found that a

259
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,450
number of them were due to C A's

260
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,369
implementing CT just with bugs other

261
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,620
types of bugs or the C age is not

262
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:13,800
implementing CT at all despite chrome

263
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:15,510
requiring them to so knowing that we

264
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,130
care a lot about CT comply

265
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,260
and that it's not something that should

266
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,480
be taken for granted the paper dives

267
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,970
into a few of the design factors and

268
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,920
deployment considerations that we think

269
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:32,310
helps keep CT compliance high I'll give

270
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,459
one example here which is what we call

271
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:38,310
staged enforcement and I'm showing this

272
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,768
timeline again to illustrate that Chrome

273
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,109
has rolled out CT in a series of stages

274
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,660
as I described rather than one big flag

275
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,480
day where CT is just required for all

276
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,029
web sites all at once

277
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,649
so first Chrome began requiring CT for

278
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,480
evie certificates that was for to the

279
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,579
sort of the first stage of enforcement

280
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
evie certificates are extended

281
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,849
validation certificate they're a special

282
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,399
type of certificate that requires some

283
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,269
extra validation and is treated with

284
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,430
special browser UI so that was sort of

285
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,540
the first stage of CT enforcement the

286
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:14,459
first dipping of the toes in the water

287
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,069
subsequently chrome began requiring CT

288
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,529
for particular CAS

289
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,060
semantics as I as I talked about before

290
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:25,079
then there was this opt-in stage where

291
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,880
sites could opt in to CT enforcement for

292
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,310
the protection of their own users and

293
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,980
finally chrome began requiring CT for

294
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,969
all certificates issued after April 2018

295
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,970
which is where we are today

296
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,670
so in the paper we talked about how a

297
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,490
lot of these different stages

298
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,310
contributed to successful CT deployment

299
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,920
I'll give just a couple examples here if

300
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,739
we look at this evie enforcement stage

301
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,010
this was the very first way in which CT

302
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,600
was required for certificates and the

303
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,790
way that this enforcement mechanism

304
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,649
worked is that this evu I would be

305
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,860
dropped if the certificate didn't have

306
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:04,230
CT so it wasn't a full breakage or error

307
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,040
it was just the dropping of the the e v

308
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:11,970
UI now overall this enforcement stage

309
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,310
went pretty well I at any given time it

310
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,250
was less than 4% of connections that

311
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,130
lost their evu I do too due to the CT

312
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,500
requirement but we also learned from

313
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,329
this stage of enforcement that even

314
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,510
though CAS will implement CT when

315
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:29,459
required to they won't necessarily do it

316
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,829
Tribune Aversa Lee so

317
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:34,050
even after this this CT requirement

318
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,269
rolled out for Evy certificates we saw

319
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,639
that a number of CAS kept issuing Evy

320
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,470
certificates without CT even though

321
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,069
these certificates wouldn't work out of

322
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:46,350
the box in chrome so the lesson learned

323
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:48,719
from this stage is that CAS will

324
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,929
implement CTE when required to but not

325
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,809
all not not all in necessarily and so we

326
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:56,009
had to be mindful of that when

327
00:13:53,809 --> 00:14:02,040
implementing future stages of CT

328
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:03,929
enforcement as another example I talked

329
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,480
about this opt-in stage where websites

330
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:09,509
could opt in to different levels of CT

331
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,040
enforcement in the browser one of the

332
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:13,980
levels that they could opt in to you was

333
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,660
a reporting mode so when chrome observes

334
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,790
a connection to these opted-in sites

335
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,618
chrome would just that doesn't have CT

336
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,449
chrome would just send a report to those

337
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:23,009
sites to say hey something's up you

338
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:27,089
think you're supporting CT but you're

339
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:28,619
not so in this in-between stage there

340
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,629
was a large website which you can see

341
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:32,369
here which discovered a Mis

342
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:35,610
configuration in how they were serving

343
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:37,439
SATs and when this configuration was

344
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,999
non-obvious they needed this reporting

345
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:41,790
mode to figure it to figure it out

346
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:44,339
basically the MIS configuration was that

347
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,969
the website began serving an SCT from a

348
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:50,129
new log that was trusted by chrome but

349
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,839
not yet widely distributed to all chrome

350
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:54,869
users yet so it was an update that was

351
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,790
still in the process of rolling out but

352
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:59,850
the website already had began serving an

353
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,519
SCT from that log and the result was

354
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,369
this very sizeable dip in a successful

355
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,079
CT adoption as measured by chrome but

356
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:09,420
because this happened during this

357
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,819
in-between optin reporting mode stage

358
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,059
this didn't result in any end user

359
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,920
impact and this miss configuration was

360
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:23,969
fixed before it did result in any

361
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:25,229
breakage or errors for users so I don't

362
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,139
want to claim that everything has been

363
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,759
sunshine and roses for CT there have

364
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,410
been many design decisions and

365
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,720
deployment considerations that can have

366
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:38,549
contributed to successful adoption but

367
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,860
there have also been some challenges one

368
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:41,740
example is the large implementation

369
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,020
investment

370
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,480
that CA requires from multiple

371
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,420
stakeholders in the ecosystem but

372
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,770
especially from browser vendors so I

373
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,620
mentioned that at the time of writing

374
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:57,579
chrome was the only browser that had a

375
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,950
mature CT implementation and this isn't

376
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,750
just a problem because it requires a lot

377
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,790
of resources from browsers it's a

378
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,860
problem because users don't get the

379
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,579
security benefits if they can just

380
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,080
switch to other browsers so in 19% of

381
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,270
the help forum threads that we looked up

382
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,040
users talked about how when they

383
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,280
encounter a CT error they just switch to

384
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,099
another browser and the site works there

385
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,050
because the site doesn't implement CT so

386
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,060
that means that even though chrome had a

387
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,290
CT implementation users weren't

388
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,300
necessarily getting the security

389
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,010
benefits of it and the large

390
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,349
implementation burden put on browser

391
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:36,840
vendors was getting in the way of users

392
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,840
getting the full security benefits of CT

393
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,970
to wrap up the talk I just want to give

394
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,680
a few tidbits of some of the other

395
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,100
things that we talked about in the paper

396
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,989
that I didn't have time to get into here

397
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,330
we looked at how CT adoption and

398
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,950
compliance has changed over time how

399
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,560
it's grown and what's what factors have

400
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,780
gone into that things like why popular

401
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,560
websites have adopted CT and why they

402
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:05,889
haven't we also dug more deeply into the

403
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,359
user impact looking at not just things

404
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,209
like the click-through rate and they use

405
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,979
their reactions to these errors but also

406
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,750
client-side performance costs and

407
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,610
finally we talked about some of the open

408
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,310
research problems that need to be solved

409
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:22,689
before a CT can be fully deployed and

410
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:24,129
achieve its full security benefits so I

411
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,620
think that CT is a very interesting

412
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,690
system technically but it's even more

413
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,659
interesting maybe to look at how it's

414
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,980
been deployed in the real world with

415
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,170
systems like this it's not always

416
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,570
obvious what to optimize for what

417
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,330
metrics to look at and our hope is that

418
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,490
by looking in depth at what has worked

419
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,110
and not worked so well for CT we can

420
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,060
bring out some lessons that can be

421
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,219
applied to other similar systems in

422
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:57,169
future Thanks

423
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:57,170
[Applause]

424
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,670
thanks for the great talk Emily probably

425
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:07,550
you have considered using a public city

426
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,680
log auditable for that using a

427
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,230
blockchain what are your thoughts on

428
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,350
that is it possible or what do you want

429
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,720
to do that what are the performance

430
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,209
issues have you have you considered it

431
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,490
well I'm not a designer of CT myself so

432
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,000
it's it's more a question for the CT

433
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,550
team I guess I think the question is

434
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,620
what exactly do you mean by blockchain

435
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,180
and what properties are you hoping to

436
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,330
get out of it because some people would

437
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:38,180
call the internal CT log structure a

438
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,750
blockchains no I mean literally a chain

439
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,520
of blocks for example using a theorem -

440
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,230
so taking advantage of the fact that a

441
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,660
theorem already has some proof of work

442
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,190
and blocks going on to store data there

443
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,840
so that we don't depend on a federation

444
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,430
but we can relax some of the security

445
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,909
guarantees some of the security

446
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:57,680
assumptions I think the proof of work

447
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,440
model does not fit particularly well

448
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,370
into CT but it's an interesting maybe

449
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,980
discussion to have offline perhaps on

450
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,409
like one of the CT design lists because

451
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,430
like i said i'm not a i'm i work on

452
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:17,810
chrome not the CT implementation itself

453
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:20,840
thank you thanks hi there Nicholas Allen

454
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:23,570
from Amazon so one of the early adoption

455
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,730
reasons for CT was for EB certificates

456
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,950
like you talked about and recently we've

457
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,500
kind of seen a decline in interest in

458
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,780
evey from certain sectors do you think

459
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,970
that the adoption of CT has kind of

460
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:40,160
reduced some of the need and use case

461
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:45,350
for EB certificates overall I think the

462
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,590
I think the the tying together of EB and

463
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,959
CT is now sort of dissipated because CT

464
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,820
is now required for practically all

465
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,310
certificates for all newly issued

466
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,230
publicly trusted certificates so I do

467
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,790
think they're sort of separate at this

468
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,270
point not tied together

469
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,050
however because as you said evey is sort

470
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,410
of on the dick

471
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,909
in some ways there is an interesting

472
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,360
question about if we were going to

473
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:15,050
deploy a system like CT again and Evie

474
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,270
was not widely used enough to make a

475
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,490
dent or if browsers dropped to their

476
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,980
Evie UI and that wasn't something that

477
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,830
could be used as a first enforcement

478
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,360
stage for something like this there's

479
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,220
kind of an open question about what what

480
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,020
we would do there there's no if there is

481
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:36,080
no more Evie to use as a first kind of

482
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,740
slice of certificates to to experiment

483
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,740
with enforcement

484
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,750
[Applause]
