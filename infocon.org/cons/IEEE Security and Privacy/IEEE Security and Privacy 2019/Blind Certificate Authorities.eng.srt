1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,310
Oh Sam here hi good morning everyone my

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,890
name is Alma I'm a postdoc from

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,330
Princeton University today I'm going to

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,150
introduce a plan a certificate

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,139
authorities this is the Tron work of its

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,689
geography a common hobby so certificate

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,930
authorities or say A's play important

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,810
roles in today's applications since our

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,540
response for issuing certificates which

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,600
attached to a person or organizations

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,650
identity or attributes so the most

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,500
common use of sale in PKI say we are see

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,379
certificate in Europe and public keys to

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,690
a dentist so in the normal certificate

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,210
generation workflow the snoozer

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,030
providers say with all the necessary

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,120
information including our identity and

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,259
the city while did users ardente

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,000
before generating their certificate and

20
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:11,579
the new serving can use the certificate

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,100
in other applications like email web

22
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,809
site login or anonymous credential

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,059
systems

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,130
surely the certificate is the cradle the

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,640
certificate for anonymous credential

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,810
systems for West and linkable

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,520
privacy-preserving way for user

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,640
authentication between our existing

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,390
system and did he validation are also

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,130
called user registration reveal the true

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:45,390
identity of the users to the same in

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,089
some scenarios the user may not one may

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,409
not want anyone to know her real

34
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,500
identity see a whistleblower was to

35
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,590
report some scandals to a journalist and

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,180
the journalist need to verify the

37
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,650
whistleblowers identity to validate the

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,689
source of information but the visible

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,539
work does not know whether the

40
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,640
journalist can be trust or not and if

41
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,119
they are using some random anonymous

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,609
credential system the the general the

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,120
veto blower also need to confirm that

44
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:25,620
say the trust word and actually

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,180
some some system required that the same

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,580
has to be stackable to pay the

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,709
organization of the whistleblower which

48
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:41,250
is impossible so reviewing 22 any

49
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:44,519
parties could be risky so knowing

50
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,760
identity of all users could make a say a

51
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,730
single horn up of previous failure

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,540
especially in anonymous credential

53
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,819
system if the city has been compromised

54
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,190
the user won't be able to achieve

55
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:04,798
anonymity and more and in this work we

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,310
ask this question can we validate the

57
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,940
identity we would not learn yet the

58
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,599
answer appears to be no but with

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:17,010
multi-party secure multi-party

60
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:22,048
computation and their knowledge proof

61
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,450
techniques we make this happen so in

62
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,690
this talk I will introduce a secure

63
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,078
channel injection which is a general

64
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,900
tool that allow a party to inject a

65
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,450
small amount of information into us

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,690
secure the channel mounted by two

67
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,690
parties and we show how to inject

68
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,980
messaging here at session efficiently

69
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:51,510
and we leverage a secure channel

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,988
injection to validate that - tada a new

71
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,870
way for e-mail verification a 100 is a

72
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,389
user on some email account from a given

73
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,829
organization but with all knowing which

74
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:08,340
account and finally we develop this plan

75
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:12,299
say that related to the ownership of

76
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,690
account say Alex at domain.com and issue

77
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:19,680
us five own life certificates that

78
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,440
pending Alex - a public key we thought

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:28,770
without learning the account under the

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,460
key so now I will explain how to build

81
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,840
Plan C

82
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:37,060
our work focus on email identity

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,609
the most common day today I believe

84
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,210
everyone has done email verification

85
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,699
before so in a conditional email

86
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,729
verification the user gives us say a

87
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,470
email account and the decease and the

88
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:53,639
challenging an email to the email

89
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,590
account provided by the user another

90
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,050
another user loves in later locks into

91
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,210
an email account and the Gator challenge

92
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,570
and the present a challenge to the say

93
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:08,109
to complete the verification so

94
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,539
importantly the the Commission on e-mail

95
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,360
verification proof or account ownership

96
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:19,000
by showing the ability to read an email

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:22,090
from the count and how does our message

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,300
work differently first let's look at

99
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,419
secure channel injection so insecure

100
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,660
Channel injection to parties Alex and

101
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,150
the pub establish a secure channel that

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,750
was protected by some shared secret keys

103
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,049
and then the third party carer holds a

104
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,479
private message and Alex and public will

105
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:47,289
exchange some message in the English

106
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,020
secure channel and at a given time the

107
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:54,520
given point of communication Carol runs

108
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:57,130
and piece a protocol with Alex to inject

109
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,330
this private message in the sacred

110
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:03,849
message send from Alex pair Alex provide

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:08,500
the secret keys and the Carib provides

112
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:11,740
the private message so other results the

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,039
pub will it never aware of the injection

114
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,620
and the from his perspective adjusting

115
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,229
all the messages including the private

116
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,800
message hold back terror are from Alex

117
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:27,400
and Alex learns nothing opposes a

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,650
private message from Kara and Carol

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35,500
looks nothing about the other messages

120
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:38,169
from Alex now we show how to use a

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,230
secure telling injunction to build our

122
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:45,109
new e-mail verification as it we call

123
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:47,410
we call it anonymous proof of account

124
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,540
ownership our Nana's Paul

125
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,330
so as I'm keep here it's a protocol for

126
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,930
sending emails and the he anonymous Paul

127
00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:00,620
the say serve as a proxy or middle boss

128
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:04,040
between a user say Alex and the SMT

129
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:07,970
server for for the users email account

130
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:11,360
and the most time to say just forwarded

131
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:15,380
a traffic back and forth and the user

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,120
logs into her email her assessment email

133
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,400
cannot and standard email from the

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,210
account to some mailbox that she has

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,750
access to and when the email consumer

136
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,450
say the sale was secure channel

137
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,830
rejection which the user to inject the

138
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,539
challenge into the email and this email

139
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,120
will be forwarded by the estimate is

140
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,330
over to the mobile specified in the

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,670
email under later you the user can

142
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:50,300
access her in this email goes to

143
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:55,070
Catholic challenged and pivoted to say

144
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:59,270
to complete the verification so as rise

145
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:02,360
the user can send an email from the SMP

146
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,570
server at the tomah comm the same knows

147
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,870
that the user has some account that

148
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,719
belong to Tommy calm so differ from

149
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,630
conventional email verification our

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,180
message proof account ownership by

151
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:23,719
showing the ability to send an email

152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:27,220
from the Frey account so those who say

153
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,610
does not know the exact email account

154
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:34,310
knowing one awesome account from our

155
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,720
organization it's already useful for

156
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:39,969
example one can prove to a journalist or

157
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,460
some like and

158
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,650
and anonymous review have said or celery

159
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,020
sharing website then change the working

160
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,780
as a given organization without

161
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,240
reviewing the actual working working

162
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:58,990
emails and which greatly improved

163
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,630
privacy and the e anonymous for the user

164
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:06,070
and say II need to inject a challenge

165
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:09,790
into a TR session and we focus on a yes

166
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,640
e BC and the sha-256 in our talk and we

167
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,760
can see construct constructing a kiosk

168
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,189
record under this sever suite it's quite

169
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:25,210
complex and for 512 ads email under

170
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:29,760
system but a challenge if we use generic

171
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:34,720
and PC techniques we got a very large

172
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,660
circuit it has about one of near van

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,500
mewling and gates and it could be very

174
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,380
slow so we we so we therefore we design

175
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,700
a more efficient special-purpose and PC

176
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,850
protocol so our observation is that

177
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:56,770
review the intermediate computing result

178
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:58,510
of shard 256 and AES DBC will not break

179
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,990
the security properties of these

180
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,930
functions for example shall to fix this

181
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,870
v 56 user merkle-damgard construction

182
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:12,099
and a message will be split into blocks

183
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:14,590
and a comprehension matrix at the input

184
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,110
of message block and the output will

185
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:22,450
serve as the input for the next round of

186
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,980
compression so we found that the output

187
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,990
of the comparator function can be

188
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,800
treated as a random stream and the

189
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:34,030
reveal no information about the input so

190
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,449
a seminary s+ want to ask lucky plots in

191
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:40,270
calpads say which is the challenge and

192
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:43,180
the the user can send the output of the

193
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:47,500
compare function for block ads to the CA

194
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:50,560
another see continue to run the compress

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,610
function for the block X plus one to at

196
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,869
plus K and finally stand back

197
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:05,230
send back the output of the contraction

198
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:08,860
4x plus K back to the user and similarly

199
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:13,840
in a est BC the user considered a

200
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:17,350
separate text of block X to the C under

201
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,930
the seat controls legendary NPC with the

202
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,140
user to compute the several texts for

203
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:26,050
the challenge from photochallenge

204
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:29,439
and the stand back to the serotypes of

205
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,229
the last block of the challenge tools to

206
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:39,010
the user and so the user can continue to

207
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:41,980
compute the rest sir vertex and in this

208
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,130
so in the same setting our protocol only

209
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,700
need to compute a full AES blocks and

210
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:52,150
the using standard and PC techniques and

211
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,270
the we do not need to use as a missive

212
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,130
at all for computing each mark this

213
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:04,120
significant discus significantly

214
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:06,900
improved the performance we further peel

215
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,440
the plants a AE using anonymous Paul

216
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:15,670
first let's look at how SMT works so

217
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,480
here is the simplified SMD session it

218
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:22,209
consisted of four steps the first the

219
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,560
Klan's sends a message to the server and

220
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:30,190
to prepare to set up the smtp TLC our

221
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,380
session and notify the empty server that

222
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,380
leads to get ready for sanitation and

223
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,780
the in step two the Quran sent the

224
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,439
authentic message which consists which

225
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,240
contains the username and the password

226
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,560
and then the cleansed and some other

227
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:51,910
message to notify the server that she's

228
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:56,380
ready for sending email and finally the

229
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,949
clan will send the email an implant an

230
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,320
implant

231
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,650
we only care about step two and a stop

232
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,410
step four here so in step two we will

233
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,030
grab the TOC fragment for the

234
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,520
authentication message as

235
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:13,089
commitment to users and dignity because

236
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,120
it will contain the user name unknown in

237
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,100
step 4 we draw an honest pour to inject

238
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:23,140
a challenge into the email under the

239
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,550
savior recalls the challenge being used

240
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,689
for forgiven for SMT session and the

241
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:35,290
corresponding commitment for later use

242
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:38,290
and then the Szish generator create a

243
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,199
certificate certificate tablet and the

244
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,839
sheraton with the user so all the fields

245
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,870
in the certificate Alex are a public

246
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,280
except for the subject and the public

247
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:54,160
key and the user fills in the meeting

248
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,490
for and the generated a hash of the

249
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,930
certificate then we use the decay Boop

250
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:04,840
of the cable framework to general

251
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:08,109
generator their knowledge proof so the

252
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,810
capo can express now interactive their

253
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,600
knowledge proof as boolean circuit and

254
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:18,329
that the user need to generate a a

255
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:22,270
single circuit to show that to show that

256
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:24,730
the email account being used the email

257
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,670
color and the public key being used for

258
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,010
the certificate she knows the American

259
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,829
apology for constructing the certificate

260
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,790
and also knows the opening for the kiosk

261
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,589
commitment the sacred key America and

262
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,510
also the email account in the

263
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:45,220
certificate in the same as the email

264
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:47,140
coming in that has commitment and the

265
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,210
user Center challenged the hash of the

266
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,970
certificate under the proof to the say a

267
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,130
the C would retrieve the commitment

268
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,580
based on the challenge and the verify

269
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,450
just proof paternal commitment and our

270
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,250
sins okay

271
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:05,470
the CBO send will send the hash of the

272
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,380
certificate and the Synod back to the

273
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,470
user and the user will just attach the

274
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,510
signature to the original search to

275
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,050
construe a well it as they own a

276
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,050
certificate

277
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:23,559
so we so we implement the anonymous poll

278
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:27,369
using malicious secure and PC libraries

279
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:30,040
and we test the performance of Paul and

280
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:33,670
the different the sightings in the

281
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,959
control setting all these real Anthony

282
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:41,799
servers and we can see the overhead are

283
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:45,790
relatively small and for certificated

284
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,949
generation and verification since all

285
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:53,529
these processes are completed offline or

286
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:56,139
we sync the overhead are acceptable so

287
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:59,079
when we want to use the duration of the

288
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:02,799
I semi TV session I to detect anomalies

289
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:06,599
Paul because the actual overhead but we

290
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:10,749
analyze the delusion of eight thousands

291
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,569
SMT Tbk on session extract from real

292
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:15,730
Network compare real Network traces and

293
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:19,360
we found that the explosion of the

294
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:23,589
duration in the long-tailed so actually

295
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,259
15 percent of the SMT session it's long

296
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:29,290
are longer than 20 seconds which

297
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:35,439
suggests session duration may not be a

298
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:37,959
reliable detector in summary with the

299
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:41,110
end of first plant certificate or

300
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:43,118
certificate the earth plants a a say

301
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,459
that can validate to the dentist and the

302
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:48,459
issue certificates without learning the

303
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:51,279
identity and our plans a actually come

304
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:55,719
work for ports a yes ABC and a that GC D

305
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:59,439
mu G same mode and our our say achieve

306
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,019
of participation privacy which means the

307
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:05,020
prover does need to reveal her identity

308
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:08,409
to any parties theory no verification

309
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,888
and please say our people form all

310
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,889
tedious

311
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,999
[Applause]

312
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,970
we have a little bit of time for

313
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,640
questions if you come up to the

314
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,800
microphone there and the next speaker

315
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,690
just get ready and the third speaker

316
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:34,190
please go in the back and be prepared to

317
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,840
get the microphone set up I guess I have

318
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,090
a question have you thought about

319
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,709
extending these to for example other

320
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,879
type of authentication mechanisms

321
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,100
besides email yes yeah I think so - I

322
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,530
know attraction is a very general tool

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:55,280
so it definitely can work with other

324
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:58,160
protocols other secure channels shall we

325
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:03,509
thank the speaker again

326
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,509
[Applause]
