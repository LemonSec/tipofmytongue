58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,880
next step we've got to figure out so EJ

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,470
thank you so much for all of your work I

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,280
realized there's more and we'll do our

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,290
best to support you to status reports so

62
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,660
like I said the TC is is probably all of

63
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,739
you and then some at last time I count

64
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,650
when I pulled the membership roster

65
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,540
about two weeks ago two thousand three

66
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,280
hundred seventy three people anybody can

67
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,799
join it's free you don't have to be an I

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,090
Triple E member there's the URL right

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,120
there go for it

70
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,110
and then you are a member what does the

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,470
TC SP do primarily the TCS B does

72
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,390
financial co-sponsorship of a number of

73
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,120
conferences and workshops that includes

74
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,589
this event the I Triple E symposium on

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,880
security and privacy

76
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:26,000
computer security foundations symposium

77
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:29,120
euro SP which has existed since 2016 SEC

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,810
dev which it took over financial

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,720
sponsorship I didn't do that let's say

80
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,640
in 2018 host which is a hardware

81
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,790
security conference that that we

82
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,559
co-sponsor with another TC and the

83
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,090
privacy aware computing conference which

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,550
we co-sponsored for in a couple of years

85
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,900
as well we technically co-sponsor a few

86
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,959
other conferences as well which is to

87
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,110
say we lend our name and endorsements to

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,150
those conferences but we don't actually

89
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,820
offer money to that to them we are also

90
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,730
called upon periodically in other roles

91
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,200
as well we've taken a role in helping to

92
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,268
offer support of the I Triple E

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,350
statement on strong encryption and a

94
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,350
number of other things as well

95
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:15,109
here's another snapshot of what the TC

96
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,399
SP does these are some stats about a few

97
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,959
of the events from both this year and

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:23,239
last year as well you can see this is a

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,090
lot to take in on one page here but just

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,190
to kind of summarize for posterity you

101
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,020
can see that host is now has become a

102
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,440
fairly sizable conference hovering

103
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:37,409
around 300 people 25 papers

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,790
sect of is an ongoing growing conference

105
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,540
it hasn't taken place yet so we don't

106
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,470
have attendance but well over a hundred

107
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,320
attendees there as well

108
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,820
CSF is ongoing and is a partner to

109
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,890
current periodically with other

110
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,940
conferences as well to broaden its own

111
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,400
support euro SP again also hasn't taken

112
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,860
place yet but has a growing number of

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
submissions to that as well and is

114
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,550
becoming a quite a solid event in its

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,799
own right as well um little status

116
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,870
report and updates on what the TC this

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,050
year so as I mentioned EJ Jung has

118
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,700
become our awards chair she has taken on

119
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,680
the role of establishing and documenting

120
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,979
the process for all of the TC ESPY

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,080
Awards the the symposium on security

122
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,480
security and privacy has over the past

123
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,030
ten years or so really developed a

124
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,310
wonderful handbook and codified set of

125
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,200
procedures that can be handed down from

126
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,970
one person who has served in a role to

127
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,310
the next it's been refined develops

128
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,140
modified as we have evolved and grown it

129
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,720
is the bedrock of how this symposium is

130
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,460
run and the TC has been looking to do

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,280
similar things in order to codify its

132
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,400
policies and procedures and EJ has had a

133
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,080
role in in helping to establish that for

134
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,159
awards and we'll be doing that for other

135
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,599
things as well and handled all of what

136
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,430
she was in the process of handling all

137
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,610
of the t CSP conferences as I mentioned

138
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,560
there are now five active ones and so

139
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,230
we'll be doing awards for those

140
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,030
conferences from the TC as well and the

141
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,169
T CSP outstanding community service

142
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,760
awards another T CSP activity that has

143
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,960
taken place over the past couple of

144
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,270
years as well as that we've supported

145
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
the code of conduct which is now in

146
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,690
place as well you've seen the code

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,870
stewards and heard the announcements on

148
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,520
about the the implementation of the code

149
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,480
of conduct over the past couple of years

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,789
this first began last year and was

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,370
refined and reintroduced this year and

152
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,770
is also at SEC dev and will be gradually

153
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,100
pushing this out to all of the other

154
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,320
conferences as well now that we've

155
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,760
better understand the process a bit

156
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,409
again we also represent the TCS B

157
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,069
community to they a triple e in Computer

158
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,139
Society we

159
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,210
taken a significant role in ensuring

160
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,009
working with the Computer Society to

161
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,020
ensure continued support of the the open

162
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,340
access model that we enjoy right now of

163
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,979
the continuous submission and review

164
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,469
model that we enjoy right now and and

165
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,750
other sorts of things as well

166
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,430
finances we had about a sixty six

167
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,800
thousand dollar budget that was approved

168
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,810
this year just about everything is given

169
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,840
back to the conferences

170
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,759
the vast majority of that goes to

171
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,349
activities at the symposium so there was

172
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,669
about 30k that was given to the

173
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,039
symposium to support the 40th

174
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,440
anniversary this year quite a bit for

175
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,719
the test of time Awards quite a bit for

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,139
financial support of student travel so

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,979
the student PC the student the SP speed

178
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,840
mentoring and there's a smaller amount

179
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:38,050
of support that goes into some of the

180
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,729
other TC SP conferences as well another

181
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,169
major initiative that we went through

182
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:44,039
this year is that we established the

183
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:47,169
test of time awards as I mentioned in my

184
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:50,680
brief earlier presentation Stephan

185
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:53,099
bought this idea to elf and I in late

186
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,810
2017 and we thought it was a great idea

187
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,750
but realized it was going to take some

188
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,789
time to get together so we first had to

189
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,460
understand how how this I actually

190
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:07,240
should work this is gonna be now a core

191
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,219
component of the the I Triple E security

192
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,469
symposium on security and privacy it's

193
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:13,090
not only going to continue forward but

194
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:15,460
celebrating the 40 year history of the

195
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,830
symposium so the first thing that we did

196
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,719
was establish a committee to to lay out

197
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,630
the ground rules which Stephan chaired

198
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:25,330
and worked on along with 'var and Brian

199
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,759
Pernod and Mike writer once those

200
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,279
initial ground rules were established we

201
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,990
initiated the first two what I would

202
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,270
call regular rounds which are the rounds

203
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,390
that are looking at papers from 10 to 12

204
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:43,449
years ago so the first round which was

205
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:46,529
awarded today was 2007 2009 and Stephan

206
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,390
put together a wonderful committee that

207
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:51,220
included David Evans our Jules Patrick

208
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,040
McDaniel Rebecca riot I hope I got all

209
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:58,520
those names right Stephan great

210
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,099
and in addition I I worked with Kathy

211
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,319
- and Steve who also collaborated with

212
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,910
Steve Lipner to establish the ketchup

213
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,250
committee which covered the first 15

214
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,719
years of awards for the symposium which

215
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,570
also included Terry Ben Zell and Carl

216
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,660
and were Theresa Lunt John McHugh Peter

217
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,700
Newman we are working on chairs and

218
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,219
committees for that for next year we

219
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,990
will have a second ketchup round so

220
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,820
there will be at least some more

221
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,670
festivities surrounding that next year

222
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,230
as well and and this process of the test

223
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,729
of time awards will continue every year

224
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,810
going forward as well and this will also

225
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,010
become a a codified process that is

226
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,900
implemented by the s and the symposium

227
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:44,060
and supported by the Technical Committee

228
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:45,590
as well I wanted to briefly mention to

229
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,119
track I'm sorry for all the text on this

230
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,410
slide I just kind of wanted to put this

231
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,970
down here because we upload these slides

232
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,160
to the website and I wanted to talking

233
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,290
about this last year we voted on several

234
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,050
formats to address presenting an

235
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,280
increased number of accepted papers

236
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,660
multi-track did receive the most support

237
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,939
but the vote didn't have the benefit of

238
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,160
information about cost and logistics so

239
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,100
it was always our plan to come back to

240
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,430
to you all this year and have a

241
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,650
so-called final vote if you will but

242
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,300
what happened over the past year or so

243
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,090
that the number of paper is accepted by

244
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,189
the program committee precluded us from

245
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,480
having the luxury of deferring the

246
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,600
decision until this year's business

247
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,170
meeting and so the general chair and

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,260
program chair came to the TTC with a

249
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,229
plan which will fire and I endorsed to

250
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,490
go to track for 2019 it was it was the

251
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,870
option that seemed to have the most of

252
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,210
support this year and so that's what we

253
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,280
did we now have some cost information

254
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,370
that cost about 30 grand more by the way

255
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,280
to go to track four in terms of AV and

256
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,080
moving the room around and so on and a

257
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,800
number of other adjustments in the event

258
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,290
to keep costs under control but here we

259
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,150
are hopefully everybody is enjoying and

260
00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:00,349
having a successful meeting we will

261
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:02,209
absolutely be soliciting feedback on

262
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,130
this in the annual survey this year

263
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,350
after we've gone through a full

264
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,010
implementation of to track for an entire

265
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,360
cycle and based on the feedback and

266
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,930
additional comments that can certainly

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,190
happen off

268
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,199
wine as well there can be additional

269
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,680
discussion about this at the business

270
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
meeting

271
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,430
next year the 2020 business meeting

272
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,450
other updates for 2020 the general chair

273
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,209
for the symposium for 2020 is Gabriela

274
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,190
geo Carly from SSRI international the

275
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:33,680
vice chair is Alvaro Cardenas

276
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,770
from UC Santa Cruz recently moved to

277
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,540
Santa Cruz the program chairs for 2020

278
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,069
who you all probably know pretty well

279
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,370
because you've already been submitting

280
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:46,339
papers that will be eligible for the

281
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:49,250
2020 symposium our hope obsession from

282
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,440
UT Austin and Elina preah from

283
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,899
Northeastern and and we're delighted to

284
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,720
have this team together for next year as

285
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,760
well as their own teams and and you

286
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,750
probably hear more about that during the

287
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,580
the closing meeting tomorrow as well

288
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,770
that's that's it for the first part of

289
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:12,140
business I would now like to move on to

290
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,740
awards and the first thing I would like

291
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:19,760
to do is is recognize mark gondry and

292
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,000
Christopher Google so before they come

293
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,680
up actually mark you can come up while

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,980
I'm saying this mark him up

295
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,979
and Christopher come up that yes please

296
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,770
when when Mark took on this role he

297
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,300
probably had a vague inkling because

298
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,100
he's quite good at math I haven't been

299
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,569
treasurer for many years that this was

300
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,390
going to be the fortieth instantiation

301
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,380
of the symposium and probably had some

302
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,449
idea that there was going to be

303
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,660
something happening along with that

304
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,810
little did he know that I was going to

305
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,029
throw the test of time Awards at him

306
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,050
little did you probably know that you

307
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,870
know particularly given the conversation

308
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,040
that last year's business meeting that

309
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,430
we were going to have an increase in the

310
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:11,170
number of acceptances both of you have

311
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:15,380
handled this heroically eloquently

312
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,969
outstandingly with grace and I can't

313
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,800
believe what an amazing job you have

314
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,260
done and how well the symposium has

315
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,060
turned out you are two wonderful people

316
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,529
in our community we appreciate your

317
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,209
service very much we know you're not

318
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,829
disappear

319
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:39,279
but I would like to honor both of you

320
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:40,209
this year thank you so much Marc Andre

321
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,129
and Christopher Cargill

322
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:48,399
thank you very much so

323
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:51,959
there's just a few other awards I wanted

324
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,999
to hand out this year as well so as a

325
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,829
Stephan pointed out the the idea that

326
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,790
you come up with good ideas means that

327
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:59,349
you might be responsible for

328
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,469
implementing them and let that be a

329
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,809
lesson to all of you so it did take

330
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,059
about 22 months to put all of this

331
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:09,819
together for the test of time Awards it

332
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,649
was a heroic amount of effort the

333
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:14,860
defining the process bringing the

334
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:17,019
community together to to characterize

335
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,929
what this process should look like to

336
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,059
take something with the history of the

337
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:26,019
Oakland conference of this symposium and

338
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:28,360
ensure that what how the the most

339
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:31,449
impactful and important works that have

340
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,529
been done here are are honoured properly

341
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:38,290
and enshrined as awardees of the test of

342
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,769
time is a non-trivial amount of X of

343
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,699
effort the the process definition

344
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:46,869
particularly that Stephan went through

345
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:49,479
for this the number of papers that I

346
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:53,049
cannot imagine that Kathy's committee

347
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,899
went through in order to come up with

348
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:59,709
the list they came up with is

349
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:02,290
mind-boggling this is a volunteer effort

350
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,628
that will be worth its salt for many

351
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,248
many many years to come and I hope many

352
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,559
people in this audience are either

353
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:11,559
awardees or future awardees that will

354
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,329
benefit from from this and or will

355
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,889
benefit from reading some of the papers

356
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,160
that have have been honored this year

357
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:22,299
and beyond I would like to honor Stephan

358
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,829
savage for being the inaugural chair of

359
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,899
the test of time awards committee and

360
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:27,248
Kathy meadows for chairing the first

361
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,869
catch-up committee the amount of work

362
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:29,920
you've done is so important please come

363
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:40,679
up

364
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:40,679
[Applause]

365
00:15:46,800 --> 00:16:00,760
[Applause]

366
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:03,150
I have one more award as well and there

367
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,430
are many people who volunteer their time

368
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,930
for the symposium for the Technical

369
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:12,540
Committee for all of the activities that

370
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:17,290
take place within here many of those

371
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:20,170
people are work in the background they

372
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,780
do things that we we benefit from that

373
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,610
we appreciate that make our the

374
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,390
symposium better that make our careers

375
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,950
better and we we often don't necessarily

376
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,990
know who those people are their names

377
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,170
behind them they're not necessarily up

378
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,260
on stage all of the time but but they

379
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,459
are quite vital I mentioned the awards

380
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,770
this year I've been talking about awards

381
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:46,900
I think for most of this session so far

382
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,130
in in the beginning of this symposium I

383
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,110
don't know about the beginning but at

384
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,780
least up until relatively recently there

385
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,490
was the TC there was the symposium and

386
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,100
there was CSF and all of a sudden we

387
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,560
have five maybe six conferences that we

388
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,140
are putting under the financial umbrella

389
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,540
of the TC we've instituted test of time

390
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,329
awards the nature of awards has gotten

391
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,550
quite large as I was talking with this

392
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,730
about Hilary Ormond who had been doing

393
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,680
awards up until this current year she

394
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,150
was describing to me the process that

395
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,040
she had used to create these wards

396
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,959
designing them silk-screening them

397
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,839
painstakingly creating them and

398
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,819
producing them that this was something I

399
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,840
hadn't realised or appreciated at all

400
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:30,940
and when when we started talking about

401
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:35,919
expanding the nature of awards within

402
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:38,890
the symposium it all of this suddenly

403
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,010
started coming to light and I would like

404
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,480
to recognize Hilary has been recognized

405
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,230
before for other things that she has

406
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,360
done I would

407
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,630
to recognize her today for starting us

408
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,830
out on this process of instituting

409
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,210
Awards and the way that we recognize

410
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,299
people in our community for the

411
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,909
outstanding work that they have done

412
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:59,620
that benefits all of us and Hillary has

413
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:01,389
had an amazing role in that and I would

414
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,429
like to recognize our appreciation for

415
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:20,359
Hillary today

416
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:20,359
[Applause]

417
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:45,610
[Applause]

418
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:49,390
so as we come to the end of my part of

419
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:53,110
this particular session as I mentioned I

420
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,870
am my term ends at the end of this

421
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,389

beginning on January 1st of this year

426

433
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,370

decks are all together here so who will

451
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,979
technically up till 7:30

452
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,360
hello everybody thanks for staying so

453
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,399
late my name is Ali nope I'm from

454
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,620
Northeastern University and I'm talking

455
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:39,678
to you as a program committee culture

456
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,320
for Oakland 2020 and I'm talking on

457
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,679
behalf of the program committee cultures

458
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,289
and tC chairs and vice chairs so we are

459
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,679
thinking about different ideas to refine

460
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,600
the current Oakland submission model and

461
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,889
we are looking during this meeting for

462
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,939
your feedback

463
00:20:54,889 --> 00:21:03,889
so a couple of years of years ago the

464
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,480
program committee chairs and technical

465
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:08,719
committee chairs at the time came up

466
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,049
with this sort of novel and original

467
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,509
proposal to change the submission model

468
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,970
of Oakland from a fixed deadline once a

469
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:19,639
year to this rolling deadline every

470
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,249
month inspired by some you know previous

471
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,019
success in the data base community and

472
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:26,720
the goal of the other cause of the

473
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:30,110
original proposals were multi fold so

474
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,639
first of all one of the main main goals

475
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,039
was to allow the authors more

476
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:36,168
flexibility when they have some paper

477
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,299
ready for Oakland they should submit it

478
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,019
right away and not wait for nine or ten

479
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:44,299
months until the actual Oakland deadline

480
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:46,820
but another goal was also to improve the

481
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:49,340
quality of the paper and the whole

482
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,860
review process the idea being that the

483
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,939
program committee members would get a

484
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,340
very low volume low number of papers all

485
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,860
the time so they could allocate more

486
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,840
time for reviewing these papers they

487
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,209
will do a more careful job and they will

488
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:09,379
provide the authors more constructive

489
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:12,889
feedback so let's see what the current

490
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:15,139
status and into the 2019 was the first

491
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:19,039
year where we actually went through a

492
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:22,070
whole cycle of 12 deadlines on the first

493
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,860
of every month and including on January

494
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:28,970
1st that was the first until December

495
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:32,539
4th and what happened 2019 is that we

496
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,940
had PC members to review six times a

497
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:37,908
year each review cycle was two months so

498
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,970
it spans the entire year and then at the

499
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:42,670
end of every review cycle we have an

500
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,490
9pc meeting to make the final decisions

501
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,010
for accepted papers and authors get back

502
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,840
the notifications in two months from the

503
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,000
moment they submitted so if you submit

504
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,939
on January 1st you get a notification on

505
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,010
like February 28th and so let's see how

506
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:00,610
this compares with the previous model

507
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:03,310
before 2018 where we had as we all know

508
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,340
we had one deadline a year that was I

509
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:08,740
guess 39 years of Oakland right so we

510
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,889
had one deadline in about mid November

511
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,410
and then papers went through several

512
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,120
multiple rounds of reviews of first

513
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,270
round of review where you they get like

514
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,479
three three reviews by paper then some

515
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:25,210
papers will get more more reviews and

516
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,130
then there will be an in-person PC

517
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,990
meeting where we actually discuss in

518
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:33,100
details all the papers and make final

519
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:35,920
decisions so if we compare it to mothers

520
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,290
clearly there are some advantages and we

521
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,630
observe as a community a lot of benefit

522
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,850
and I hope everyone in that room agrees

523
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,880
with me that this was actually a

524
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,340
successful experiment and I just like to

525
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,790
mention some of the advantages of the

526
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:54,010
new submission model in particular as

527
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,970
authors all of us have experienced that

528
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:00,670
we have a lot of flexibility we can pick

529
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,950
the submission cycle and submit pretty

530
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,590
much every month or we can actually work

531
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:09,310
on our papers to make them better to

532
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,169
submit a paper that really proud of the

533
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,629
other I would say benefit are that

534
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,240
accepted papers become available

535
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,310
immediately they are disseminated online

536
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,760
after one month after the acceptance

537
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:24,100
decision so that's a benefit in having

538
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,260
all these results available early right

539
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,860
you don't have to wait until May to read

540
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,690
the paper for like say Oakland 2020 you

541
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:36,300
can actually read papers for Oakland

542
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:39,700
2020 now there are already online and I

543
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,639
I believe also that the paper quality

544
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,220
improves by having this revised decision

545
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,840
option so authors get back a list of

546
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,670
items they need to address from the

547
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,649
program committee and then they work on

548
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,960
those they address them the papers

549
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,419
become stronger

550
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,519
they are accepted so all of that is good

551
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:59,460
and overall we've seen some statistics

552
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:02,309
earlier that the overall load for PC

553
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,549
members was actually reduced but it was

554
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,619
spanning a continuous time so also

555
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:10,320
Auckland was influential in the entire

556
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,449
community and because of this successful

557
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,178
experiment now all the conferences all

558
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:19,169
the top four conferences have multiple

559
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,360
submissions deadline year so all of this

560
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:24,090
is good so we see all these advantages

561
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,189
but there are a few things that I think

562
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,529
can be improved and this is what we're

563
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,779
thinking about and in particular two

564
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,700
items I want to bring up so the first is

565
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,100
that we have this continuous review

566
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,309
process for PC members so for people

567
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,678
that have been on the PC in 2019 they

568
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:43,139
can attest to that so it's really six

569
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,960
cycles it's every month you have to read

570
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:49,199
some number of papers and the other

571
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,149
issue is that because we had we promised

572
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,409
the others to have the short turnaround

573
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:58,258
of two month we actually had a program

574
00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:01,049
committee chairs we had to actually

575
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:03,749
remove the second round of reviews for

576
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,759
papers right so all the papers only go

577
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:07,710
through one round of reviews where they

578
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,480
get three reviews and then we need to

579
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,340
make a decision just based on three

580
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,980
reviews and sometimes what happens is

581
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,379
that we don't have enough expertise on a

582
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,299
paper but we don't have enough time to

583
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:21,059
ask for an additional review because we

584
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:25,230
have to send the notifications back into

585
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:27,029
month and some of the so let me tell you

586
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,419
about some of the changes that we

587
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:33,169
already implemented for 2020 to address

588
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:36,149
some of these items and in particular to

589
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:38,909
thinking first about our PC members and

590
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:42,119
trying to somehow reduce the continuous

591
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:44,070
load that they experience in 2019 so for

592
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,769
that we increase the size of the PC

593
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:50,908
significantly by about 20% so we are now

594
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:53,369
at 122 PC members which is a record and

595
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:56,580
we also split the PC into multiple

596
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:59,189
groups five groups and then everybody

597
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,379
reviews in only three cycles compared to

598
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,049
six cycles before so they review about

599
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:04,669
half of the time not overall the amount

600
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,470
of

601
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:12,080
is the same but it's just the way it is

602
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:14,090
distributed that changed okay but there

603
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,909
are a few remaining issues and in

604
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:19,490
particular this issue of having high

605
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:22,610
quality for the reviews because it don't

606
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:25,340
have the second round of reviews and we

607
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:28,010
don't always find or we don't have time

608
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,870
to actually ask experts experts might be

609
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,629
members on the PC but also sometimes

610
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,399
external members if we have enough time

611
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,370
we can actually do a better job of

612
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,310
finding finding high expertise reviews

613
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,620
and we also found interestingly that by

614
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:46,450
splitting the PC into multiple groups

615
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:49,459
and having this many PCs this this also

616
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:52,070
somehow increases this problem because

617
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,440
for some areas we only have one or two

618
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,360
experts on the PC right and they are

619
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,920
reviewing only in three cycles so

620
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:02,719
sometimes we don't have experts

621
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:07,520
available so going forward and I'm

622
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,410
talking about 2021 because the 2020 we

623
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,260
cannot really change at this point we're

624
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,090
running for 2020 already had for

625
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,210
submission cycles we are now reviewing

626
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,909
papers for may already form a fault

627
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,980
but for 2021 the first submission

628
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,640
deadline is going to be January 1st

629
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:27,380
which is like eight month apart and

630
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,440
we're thinking about different ideas to

631
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,660
actually try to to substantially improve

632
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,000
the review quality this is one of the

633
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:39,140
things that we started to observe that

634
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,600
it suffered and I strongly believe that

635
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,520
the review cycle needs to be a bit

636
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,699
longer from the two-month that we

637
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,220
promised the others to at least 2.45

638
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,100
month where we introduced a second round

639
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,900
of reviews and not for all the papers of

640
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,270
course but for the papers that really

641
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,050
need high expertise that need additional

642
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,850
set of eyes to look at the paper and

643
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,399
also will try to limit the PC

644
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,199
fragmentation to ensure some consistency

645
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,270
right if a paper is reviewed in February

646
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:16,280
or in April we like to have similar

647
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:17,900
outcome okay so of course this this

648
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,300
would be nice to have by

649
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,970
it comes at the cost though it's not for

650
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,550
free and I think the cost is that we

651
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,500
have to cut to reduce the number of

652
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,379
submission deadlines right because if we

653
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,680
have a submission deadline every month

654
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,200
and if we if we're gonna have the review

655
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,360
cycle like say two point five month then

656
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,220
we cannot just handle three different

657
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,990
review cycles at every moment in time so

658
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,210
so some possible solution to this would

659
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,770
be to move to either a quarterly or

660
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:53,300
bimonthly deadline we're still

661
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,700
considering different options so nothing

662
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,310
is definitive we're just thinking what

663
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,620
is best for the community to have all

664
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:03,409
the flexibility to the authors but also

665
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,949
to improve the quality of the reviews I

666
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,140
would like to achieve this and we will

667
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,200
work on a full proposal in the next few

668
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,840
months and ask for community input but

669
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,490
if you have any any feedback today you

670
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,919
are welcome to come to the microphone

671
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:22,700
especially if you are like part of the

672
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:26,180
PC for 2019 or 2020 if you are an author

673
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,890
that received back reviews from us and

674
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,630
if you have any constructive feedback

675
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,190
we'd happy to hear it

676
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,190
so thank you very much

677
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,240
hi karma not from Gaza for me DFL so my

678
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,430
first feedback is I don't see why you

679
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,670
need to wait for 2021 to make changes

680
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:56,610
because you just said that right now the

681
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,050
fragmentation is not helping and we had

682
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,409
this experience this year that pass that

683
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,120
we fragmented the PC and I felt this

684
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,950
expertise and that is just damaging the

685
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,689
the the process is just emerging the

686
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,580
reviews that people received because you

687
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,200
don't have that thing so I don't really

688
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,490
see why we shouldn't or why'd you

689
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,290
shouldn't it to change this thing

690
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,850
tomorrow right if you don't know it's

691
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,920
not working there is no point in going

692
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:20,010
for another nine months and then my

693
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,570
second proposal is to keep the review

694
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,970
cycle in two months because it's very

695
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,830
nice to have a fast turnaround and you

696
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,420
can have an early reject or an early

697
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,639
accept at that point and then for the

698
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,770
papers that you need more expertise then

699
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,300
those can be for one more month you

700
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,580
don't need to treat everything the same

701
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,280
if really that the goal is to improve

702
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,439
quality then let's do things that that

703
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,990
help to them yes to have early decisions

704
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,400
I think that's something we definitely

705
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:48,630
discussed and I think it's it's a very

706
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,350
good idea thank you very much great how

707
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,960
are u c---berkeley

708
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,070
thank you so much for all your work

709
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,310
given that you've mentioned that there

710
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,480
is some shortcomings and expertise do

711
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,520
you think there's any way that you could

712
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,160
sort of release an aggregate data set of

713
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,800
sort of which papers are accepted in

714
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,020
which topics they specify and what which

715
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,879
which areas are missing essentially with

716
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,139
your expertise because I think for

717
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,940
authors when we're considering

718
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,010
submitting papers there's so many

719
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,810
deadlines right now and given that you

720
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,550
know if conferences do have certain

721
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,129
limitations and their reviewer set I

722
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,510
think it's fair for authors to know hey

723
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,890
if I submit should I submit to a

724
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:29,190
conference a or conference be if

725
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:31,410
conference is not sufficient for you to

726
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,060
look at the program committee I mean I

727
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,830
also think it would be helpful to have

728
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,210
this data and you also don't know which

729
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,330
reviewers are reviewing in which month

730
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,340
and sort of like so I mean we could

731
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,350
leverage the entire PC so it's hard for

732
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,060
us to say these twenty people are

733
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,949
reviewing in January because we are

734
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,950
calling on the experts that are not

735
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:52,470
assigned in that cycle so all the PC

736
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,760
might might review papers I agree I

737
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,930
think it's just helpful have this data

738
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,770
because you've mentioned that there's

739
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,690
this problem and

740
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,610
brethren having you do any more work I

741
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,290
think just for us to sort of assess this

742
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,490
right I don't think it leaks any

743
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,950
information but I think it would be

744
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,840
helpful for authors to be able to make

745
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:13,770
informed decisions given this data set

746
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:15,780
that exists okay wh kyo Delft so

747
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,210
disclaimer I just had a paper come back

748
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:21,000
with two times River expertise one and

749
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:23,490
one times review expertise too

750
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,960
so for me it sounds a little bit like we

751
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:28,110
are more and more gravitating towards

752
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,000
the journal concept where the PC chairs

753
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,459
or editors are basically just picking

754
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,550
people that would have the expertise to

755
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,590
review specific paper and that mod

756
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,360
actually be like a way forward so

757
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,750
instead of a PC you just have a list of

758
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,240
available reviewers for that journal

759
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:49,080
conference and then you pick based on

760
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,210
expertise and I can confirm that we've

761
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,639
been reaching outside the pieces of our

762
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,560
paper that we don't really have anyone

763
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,920
on the PC so we've been asking for

764
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,480
external expert in the field and

765
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,730
sometimes people just declined but we

766
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,810
are successful in in getting expertise

767
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:09,330
for some of the paper

768
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:10,949
Thank You Columbia so one other thing I

769
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,440
wanted to ask about is what kind of

770
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,350
matching system we are using for

771
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,480
assigning reviewers right because as an

772
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,940
author when I see the boxes to tick

773
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,880
right which areas apply the same rather

774
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,580
coarse-grained right so is that all or

775
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:32,010
are we considering say learning style

776
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:34,469
matching in automated matching but we

777
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,780
are doing bidding so PC members bid on

778
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:44,819
papers plus we have for everybody we

779
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:49,770
have a profile of which they are also

780
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:51,210
match the area so hot CRP has but that's

781
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,250
based on the men because the category

782
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:55,230
seems a lot rather coarse grain like now

783
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,210
I'll say you know they say email

784
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,520
security right so as far as I remember

785
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:05,070
there's no topic saying email security

786
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:08,160
right so there's they now there there is

787
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:10,339
but I'm saying you know they is a little

788
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,450
course brain like it requires

789
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:17,580
yeah but we're checking sigh about home

790
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,470
and I've been checking all the societal

791
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,390
first to run the automatic assignment

792
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,009
with hot CRP and we're checking and

793
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,740
we've been swapping you know reviewers

794
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:29,520
in and out and we both take a look at it

795
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:32,310
and we I mean with time I mean we're

796
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,570
doing our best to find the right expert

797
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,589
sure thank you

798
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,480
Kevin we'll go to Princeton University

799
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:41,759
I'm wondering why you're not just

800
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,830
growing the PC more so CCS for example

801
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,560
is thirty reviewers more than Oakland

802
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:49,170
has and have you considered basically

803
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,080
pairing more junior PC members with like

804
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,180
more senior PC members basically to get

805
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,299
like better review quality or more

806
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,160
expertise and more focused previous yeah

807
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,260
I think we could we could grow the PC

808
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,540
more I mean we had the challenge this

809
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,880
year you know getting people to accept

810
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,800
our invitation so I I didn't compute the

811
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,520
acceptance rate but it wasn't as high as

812
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,770
I personally expected so getting a large

813
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,750
PC I mean we really look for you know

814
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,300
people that are our expert so we're not

815
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:24,240
willing to sacrifice on quality but it's

816
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:27,030
hard to put together so a few comments

817
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,580
first of all thank you so much for your

818
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,700
work I know how much this is time that

819
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:36,589
doesn't go into research so thank you so

820
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:38,848
much it's a good idea to go to a larger

821
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:40,770
you know like less deadlines I think

822
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:43,470
that other conferences are also doing it

823
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:46,530
and it's okay to tune I remember when

824
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,029
Brian made the presentation and that's

825
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,859
what he promised we're gonna try it

826
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,869
we're going to monitor we're collecting

827
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:55,770
data and we're going to tune it so I

828
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:57,960
think it's a good idea second we can not

829
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,630
micromanage this to the level that I

830
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,300
hear some people is that we need to have

831
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,580
that many experts in this area two three

832
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,800
years ago there was very few machine

833
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,540
learning papers in security now we have

834
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,880
entire sessions so you know the

835
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,040
community is moving towards new problems

836
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,260
sometimes you have the people that are

837
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,450
the experts they're also that you have

838
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,450
conflict so it's very very difficult to

839
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,240
do that kind of micromanaging growing

840
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,549
that PC

841
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,500
too much has it some disadvantages I

842
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,970
mean we all heard of how much people

843
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,390
valued the community

844
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:34,779
the bigger the the PC is gonna go right

845
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:36,790
it's harder to maintain quality I I

846
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,600
trust you guys that you're doing a good

847
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,750
job sir

848
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:46,000
thank you okay

849
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:49,210
so thank you so much for all the

850
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,220
feedback so you'll hear from us there

851
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,200
will be some online discussion we're

852
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,930
still deciding you know how to set that

853
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,049
up but we'd like to make a decision very

854
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,879
soon if we're going to refine the

855
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:08,350
current submission model so thank you so

856
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:09,730
much and we'll be in touch okay and I

857
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,770
think the business meeting is adjourned

858
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,360
enjoy your evenings come back to the

859
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,770
symposium tomorrow don't forget the

860
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,950

861
