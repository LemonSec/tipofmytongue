have an amazing panel that I'm really

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,549
glad to have at the other conference at

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,668
this panel with me and I am Johanna

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,279
Vania from UC Santa Barbara and these

6
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:34,079
are the panelists that I would like to

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:39,239
invite actually to come on stage Peter

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:42,610

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:50,498
landing please come and sit thank you

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:50,499
[Applause]

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,149
okay I have to put forgot my glasses

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:11,520
these are the joys of age okay we can do

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,030
please have a seat I want to make this

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,090
as informal as possible I want to spend

15
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,980
a few words introducing introducing this

16
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,420
amazing panelists and I will start with

17
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:30,930
Dorothy Denning who was a professor at

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:36,360
Purdue and then join SR I moved to

19
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,660
Georgetown and is that now at NPS I am I

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,539
must confess that I'm a big fan because

21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,729
when I was much younger I read her paper

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,540
about the intrusion detection model that

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,870
was actually published in 86 in this

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,150
conference and and that has inspired a

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,000
lot of my research in intrusion

26
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,220
detection not only it's interesting

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,160
because I use that paper Dorothy's paper

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,640
in almost every presentation that now as

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,890
an entrepreneur I give at commercial

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,530
conferences because there's been a lot

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,019
of the anomaly detection of modeling

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,120
normal behavior and detecting deviations

33
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,700
from normal behavior that the

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,890
combination of Dorothy ideas with

35
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,310
machine learning have brought back in a

36
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,859
very

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,190
big way in the industry and so I always

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:30,959
always tell these practitioners in 2019

39
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,010
go read the 1986 paper that you know

40
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,750
started it all

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:40,290
she was also the PC chair in 83 and 84

42
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,420
she was also indicted in inducted in the

43
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,179
National Cyber Security all of Fame

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,609
which is Rockstar status

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,209
obviously and she has received many

46
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,190
awards including the ACM zigzag

47
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:59,370
outstanding innovation award a great

48
00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:01,650
back ok good III yeah I know I did I

49
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,910
offend anybody I'm not even I didn't

50
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:09,480
even get to Peter another of our

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,730
panelist is deb franken who's the

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,950
director of research at the National

53
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,599
Security Agency and so as a big big role

54
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,819
there right now has been she has been

55
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,929
there for quite a few years covering

56
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,600
different aspects of education training

57
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,250
and research within the NSA before that

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,459
she was at the Pacific Northwest

59
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,400
National Lab and was the chief scientist

60
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,870
in cyber security and even before then

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,989
she was professor at the University of

62
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,280
Idaho so a great resume in security and

63
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,750
interesting she also did a lot of

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,930
research in intrusion detection

65
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,840
especially in you know the smart grid

66
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,269
and cyber-physical systems so I can see

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,530
that there is a red thread going through

68
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,829
all the panelists

69
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,440
she also co-founded a company I found

70
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,930
out through Jo I didn't know that very

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,459
interesting and she was the general

72
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,910
chair in 2011 and then there is Peter o

73
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,290
who needed a hat because of the lights

74
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,299
thing I think you absolutely right

75
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,880
that's that section a smart move so

76
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,780
Peter was a researcher of Bell Labs and

77
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,080
then moved to SR I I think in I remember

78
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:29,070
1971 or something like that

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,310
he created I knew of him because he ran

80
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,949
the risks digest bulletin and this if

81
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,339
you were a security practice

82
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,649
in the 80s this was how you find out

83
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,379
about security stuff before the internet

84
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:45,209
you had to read this mailing list that

85
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,119
would least all the vulnerability all

86
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:52,949
the risks they were out there and so it

87
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:56,729
was required reading for all of us and

88
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:59,399
also he was behind the IDIS system

89
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,459
together with Dorothy that started at s

90
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:06,479
RI and that's another thing that I not

91
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:08,789
only studied very in detail in great

92
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,479
detail when I was younger but I also had

93
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:16,378
to compete against in a DARPA evaluation

94
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,449
in you know in the late 90s he also

95
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,429
worked on multics and I know there are a

96
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,759
few young people here would like what

97
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:25,708
look it up it had a lot of interesting

98
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,669
things before we thought they were

99
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:31,379
interesting things and also it's

100
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,429
interesting because it's public record

101
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:38,489
that Peter was born in the early 30s and

102
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:44,188
he has been always super active he has a

103
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:49,739
paper at nd s s or 2019 and I found a

104
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:55,499
paper on wait an experiment in musical

105
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:58,109
composition from 1957 which makes 62

106
00:05:55,499 --> 00:06:00,719
years in publication in the publication

107
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:06,989
business which is amazing and I would

108
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:10,439
say impressed he also hang out with

109
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:16,169
Einstein but and it was the PC chair in

110
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:19,799
1982 last but not least the camera he's

111
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:22,109
actually the reason why I am here in a

112
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:26,279
way because I came to the United States

113
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:28,529
do a short postdoc with dick in 1997

114
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,969
never left you I was supposed to be

115
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:34,379
there for five months in Santa Barbara

116
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:36,959
and 22 years later I'm still there and

117
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:40,769
you know loving it

118
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:44,279
he has been one of the early chair too

119
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:46,169
he was the chair in 89 sorry in 92 and

120
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,689
93

121
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,938
and he has been working on again

122
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:53,610
intrusion detection his state-transition

123
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:56,580
analysis technique is the paper that I

124
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,469
read and that's why at an XE in Boston I

125
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,258
came to him and say can we please talk

126
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,960
about your intrusion detection work and

127
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,499
say okay and since then we've been

128
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,489
working together for a very long time

129
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:11,699
another thing that is interesting that

130
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,669
you might not know is that one of his

131
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,400
very early paper was on something called

132
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:20,580
the share resource matrix methodology

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,739
that was one of the first formalization

134
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,258
to identified side channel analysis

135
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,449
spies space and time channel side

136
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,120
channel analysis and this is another

137
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,819
topic that has come back in a big way

138
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,159
and I think there was a whole session

139
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:39,259
inside channel at this conference okay

140
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:42,210
so these are our amazing amazing

141
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:44,759
panelists today and so I will start with

142
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:50,489
the obvious question and actually this

143
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:53,849
is particularly directed to Dorothy

144
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,009
sorry I'll say that but it's Dorothy and

145
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,960
it's about how the conference started I

146
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,240
know that Peter and Dorothy especially

147
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,258
have been involved in this and so I

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,759
would like to hear from them what was

149
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,789
security and privacy at the very

150
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,379
beginning so I would go back into the

151
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:15,750
70s because the symposium on security

152
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,389
and privacy in 1980 is the best of my

153
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,009
knowledge the first security conference

154
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,680
that was sponsored by a professional

155
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:26,629
association that had a call for papers

156
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,500
and before that I'm aware of only two

157
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,289
conferences that were devoted to

158
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:37,019
computer security the first one was held

159
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:39,510
outside Paris and INRIA in 1974 and the

160
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:42,060
second one and the first one was focused

161
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,948
on operating systems to the best of my

162
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:49,930
knowledge I'm the only one here that was

163
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:52,930
at that conference the second one no I

164
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:57,279
think so were you there in Rio in 1974

165
00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:02,939
oh okay yeah well it won't Peter my

166
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,970
husband yeah yeah okay okay great

167
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,940
yeah and so and then the second one was

168
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:12,610
1977 in Atlanta it was called

169
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,520
foundations of secure computing it was

170
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,800
put on by four people rich Tim alone

171
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,550
dick Lipton David napkin and and he

172
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,370
needed Jones and both Lipton and demillo

173
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:29,469
were organizers for the first conference

174
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:32,529
here so that was in 1977 and but the key

175
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,290
person in 1977 there was George divita

176
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,870
and George had the idea for this

177
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,029
conference and he wanted to see a

178
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,430
security conference that was opened up

179
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,670
sponsored by a professional organization

180
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,279
namely the I Triple E with a call for

181
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,370
papers and George did the legwork to

182
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:55,240
form the Technical Committee on security

183
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,560
and privacy which then sponsored this

184
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:04,150
conference and set up the first

185
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:06,130
conference so yeah but one quick just

186
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,720
one quick story about George because the

187
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,000
thing I remember most about George is a

188
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,540
day he called me up and he said he had

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,510
broken RSA and of course he hadn't

190
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,360
broken the math the math still works but

191
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,380
he had found a flaw in how you might use

192
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,770
the protocols and it was really all very

193
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,810
exciting but it led to the paper that I

194
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,000
wrote that that was one of my favorite

195
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:35,949
papers and it was called the many time

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,140
pad colon diamond variations so paper

197
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,420
never had that very many citations I

198
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:45,360
think Google Scholar says three but I'm

199
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,360
sure the colons why it got accepted haha

200
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,279
so another thing that was very

201
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:54,279
significant about the 1980 symposium is

202
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,860
that we covered exactly the same topics

203
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,150
that were covered in 1977 it was mostly

204
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,670
operating systems database security and

205
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,100
in cryptography

206
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,620
and the fact that we had cryptography in

207
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,630
the 1977 meeting and then again in the

208
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,260
first symposium I think was very

209
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,390
significant because in 1981 the crypto

210
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,370
conference has started and I think we

211
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,000
could have ended up with a fragmented

212
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,500
community but there were several

213
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,360
cryptographers who were involved in

214
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,430
basta symposium on security and privacy

215
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,410
and Gus Simmons who's here

216
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:35,520
was one of them and I think that turned

217
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,250
out to be key to this conference having

218
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,970
about having the very very broad

219
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:43,460
coverage across security that it has I

220
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,780
should probably also mention that

221
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,060
concurrent with all this the Department

222
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,829
of Defense was holding meetings and I

223
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,739
wasn't involved in any of that at the

224
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,020
time but I went back to see if you know

225
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,270
maybe that had some influence on the on

226
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,490
the beginning of the symposium on

227
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,400
security and privacy to the best of my

228
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,990
knowledge none of the organizers for the

229
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,360
first symposium on security and privacy

230
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,240
were at the first DoD conference there

231
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,060
was DoD launched a computer security

232
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,630
initiative in 1978 and they started

233
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,339
holding annual meetings in 1979

234
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,960
eventually that all became the national

235
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,000
computer security conference and then

236
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,190
the National information systems

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,150
security conference okay so that's kind

238
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,270
of how it got started

239
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,579
Peter do you have some yeah I've got

240
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,030
some interesting comments here number

241
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:39,240
one Matt Bishop was a co-author of the

242
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:45,270
30th anniversary paper as well as Sean

243
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:51,390
and Marv and me second Gus was at the

244
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:58,800
1981 Dorothy and I were there Irish Emir

245
00:12:51,390 --> 00:13:02,630
a few other cryptographers and in 81 we

246
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,900
had two panels first one was a panel on

247
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:10,200
cryptography and the second one was on

248
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,750
what conformal methods do for computer

249
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,610
systems

250
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,580
at the end of the first panel all of the

251
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,540
cryptographers got up and walked out

252
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,970
Gus included and wit Diffie and and Adi

253
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,699
they they spent the entire rest of the

254
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,380
day out in the lobby talking with each

255
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,770
other

256
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,860
I was program chairman in 82 and I

257
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,079
created a panel in which the

258
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,790
cryptographers and the system guys had

259
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,810
to sit together in the same panel

260
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:46,640
interesting and I think the the spin-off

261
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:49,489
that happened in 81 of the Santa Barbara

262
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:57,949
you guys take credit for that some of

263
00:13:49,490 --> 00:14:04,040
that right was part of that so I think

264
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:06,680
the the 1980 and 81 s ESPYs and in some

265
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,660
sense fostered the spin-off of the

266
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,719
crypto community which will take credit

267
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,430
for while we're at it there are a couple

268
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:23,180
of other stories here that are that are

269
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:28,040
worth talking about I think the the

270
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:31,870
growing the surge of looking at systems

271
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:37,250
as total systems is something that is

272
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:41,420
still burgeoning it hasn't really taken

273
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:44,720
hold but there were papers that tried to

274
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,089
deal with systems as the entirety the

275
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,000
notion of safety and reliability and

276
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,310
survivability and security ultimately

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,950
being emergent properties of the entire

278
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,069
system and trying to deal with little

279
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:02,180
point solutions which has been very

280
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,279
popular here yeah fails to grab the the

281
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:08,390
essence of what's going on which is that

282
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:12,020
it's the total system networking all of

283
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:16,310
the software and compilers the people

284
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,650
involved the environment the squirrels

285
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,260
eating their way through the power lines

286
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,220
and

287
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:26,790
and a submarine cables and which are

288
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,920
chewed up by sharks or whatever it's all

289
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,860
part of the problem so we have this

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,630
total system problem and the notion of

291
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,420
trustworthiness is one that is sort of

292
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,450
pervasive all the way through but still

293
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,790
not dealt with and so we're definitely

294
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:45,060
not now we're beginning to get formal

295
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,860
methods into into hardware for example

296
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,349
which we're doing with the cherry

297
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,900
architecture for example and I think

298
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,410
there's a Renaissance of formal methods

299
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,360
when we started in the early eighties we

300
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,020
were 30 years ahead of ourselves or

301
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,960
something like that and suddenly the

302
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:07,650
formal methods have become fundamental

303
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:10,460
to Microsoft and to Intel and lots of

304
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:14,689
other places so I think the the

305
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,100
Renaissance of that is beginning to

306
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,320
really take hold yeah I think there is

307
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,030
definitely a cycle where we as a

308
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,920
community come up with something that

309
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,959
might work but usually we don't have the

310
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,870
resources to make it work at scale and

311
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,510
suddenly the computing power catches up

312
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,460
as I own we can now do that but actually

313
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,980
do that means something that was done

314
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,090
you know 20 25 years ago and I found

315
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,310
that you know as a continuous you know

316
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,650
Renaissance or repetition of history in

317
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,959
different forms yeah I would like to

318
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,949
hear from Deb and then from dick about

319
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,810
their experience in their first you know

320
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:55,320
security and privacy how was it when was

321
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:59,369
it hour things changed throughout times

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,590
or stay the same what is your view on

323
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,500
that I'll give you two pieces because

324
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,720
there was one that is I showed up as a

325
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,430
brand-new gret so graduate students in

326
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,220
here soon I showed up as a brand new

327
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,510
graduate student I had no clue what I

328
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,900
was walking into

329
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,640
so I remember coming here I think well

330
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,830
not here over and Oakland of course

331
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,810
because this was the late 80s about 89

332
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,609
and showing up and there were all these

333
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,499
people that were walking around and they

334
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,329
had Brittain the papers that I had been

335
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:30,909
and I you know at that stage you don't

336
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,639
actually believe that the people whose

337
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:36,159
work you read exist there they were in

338
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:38,469
books actually on the shelves of

339
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:43,239
libraries we didn't have Google in those

340
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:45,100
old days gray hair here but but it was

341
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:46,239
really fascinating to meet people and

342
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,189
learn that you could in fact have

343
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,169
discussions outside of your room and I

344
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,629
remember the community aspect of Oakland

345
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,159
the best that there were two sets of

346
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:56,168
things you needed to do one you needed

347
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:58,960
to see every paper you possibly could

348
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:01,059
but even more importantly you needed to

349
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,440
step back and meet and talk to all of

350
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,320
the people about the work that they were

351
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,059
doing next and about your work and I

352
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,769
think that also takes me to when I do

353
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,139
begin to remember the the conference

354
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:13,239
better when I showed up more as moving

355
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:14,949
into my professional years this is where

356
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,600
I met the people that carried me through

357
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,489
the rest of all those many different

358
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,219
places that I worked this was a

359
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:24,100
community of people that held each other

360
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,350
to account in order to have excellent

361
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,969
work because I Tripoli's security and

362
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,949
privacy is about excellence of

363
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,499
accomplishment it's about doing

364
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,749
something meaningful and it really was

365
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:37,330
about sharing I've noticed that very

366
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:39,039
much that there was an and I don't know

367
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,840
if that's the same because I haven't

368
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,179
been back so much but it felt like that

369
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,799
in the audience out there that people

370
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,509
are willing to share information and

371
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,730
talk about who you could go to for help

372
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:50,499
who would be a good place to go to work

373
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,730
for if you're a graduate student who

374
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,679
might have solved the piece of the

375
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,960
puzzle that you are trying to address

376
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,639
who might be able to help analyze a

377
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,559
paper or work on something you were

378
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:02,769
having difficulty with and so it was

379
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,418
that sense of community so you asked

380
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,999
about things that are different I'll

381
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:09,369
give you some of that as well I really

382
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:12,460
think that the last decade as the time

383
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:14,649
when security and privacy became real

384
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,499
for the world outside of the

385
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:19,479
professionals because truly I'd say up

386
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:21,009
until that point when I talked about

387
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,720
cybersecurity it was mostly either

388
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:25,480
people got very impressed or their eyes

389
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,440
glazed over one or the other unless they

390
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,539
were in the community and then you could

391
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,399
have a sensible conversation but now in

392
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:32,590
the last ten years and especially in the

393
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,209
last four or five there are sensible

394
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,070
articles about cyber security the

395
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,960
average citizen is having to wrestle

396
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,639
with questions about what is the

397
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,170
security of a device they put in there

398
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,580
and some are realizing that if they

399
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,890
don't wrestle with those questions bad

400
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,330
things happen and this is very different

401
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,040
it happened a lot later than we thought

402
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,540
would happen in the Morris worm days in

403
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,460
88 when we thought that was the big

404
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,530
thing that was gonna have everybody wake

405
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,200
up so a thing that's different is that

406
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,120
the world knows what we do and another

407
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,370
thing that's different is the field has

408
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,830
gotten so very large that in order to

409
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,379
see the top level of the top excellence

410
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,020
of them 15% or less of the papers we

411
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,510
have to go dual track here you can no

412
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,190
longer expect as a cyber security

413
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,900
researcher to understand everything

414
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,390
that's going on in the field and at one

415
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,310
point that was reasonable at this point

416
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,870
it is not and so we have to have a

417
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,000
different kind and level of

418
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,800
collaboration and a different kind of

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,600
validation and Trust and the work that

420
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,520
we put forward than we did before when

421
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,959
everyone could look at everything now we

422
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,370
have to rely on the judgment and

423
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,380
collaboration of others in a different

424
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,000
way so I'd say that while the seeds of

425
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,950
that were laid but back in those days

426
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,350
that it is really a necessity now where

427
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,240
then it was a nice to have absolutely I

428
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,159
think that I have a similar experience

429
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,320
where I remember the early days where

430
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,620
you could have read everything about

431
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,350
something and now you always found like

432
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,449
500 other papers that are you know

433
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,100
popped out around the world in the most

434
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,900
obscure conferences that might be

435
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,810
relevant to what you do and it becomes

436
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,690
very difficult to do that I first job

437
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,850
was 1953 working for the Navy and at

438
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,950
that time there were people who really

439
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,139
had their grasp around the entire field

440
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,000
Hardware daily software they knew it

441
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,910
just about everything but also the field

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,560
was inherently simpler so the systems

443
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,260
were simply there were not so many

444
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,190
moving parts dick what is your exchange

445
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:27,180
so my first year at securing prophecy

446
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:31,780
was 1982 that was because of this guy

447
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:34,150
1980 in 1981 a 1980 he had verk shop

448
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,139
number one at sr i-- the week before

449
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:41,170
security and privacy in 1982 he had verk

450
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,150
shop number two at sr i okay and because

451
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,110
I was a new assistant professor I didn't

452
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:48,910
feel that I could miss two days of

453
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,159
teaching you know one for workshop and

454
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,200
one for security and privacy I finally

455
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,169
came in 82

456
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,450
and had a paper here I second most of

457
00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:01,549
the feelings that dev had about about

458
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:04,769
the intimate smaller intimate friendly

459
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:06,929
when she talked about being new I could

460
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,609
tell you how that happened but we're not

461
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:12,179
allowed to talk about those sort of

462
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:14,340
things anymore you know we won't talk

463
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,759
about sacrificial lambs or anything like

464
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,499
that anyway anyway it was small and

465
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,139
intimate that was really nice it was it

466
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:24,570
was nice meeting people like Jim

467
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:26,850
Anderson and Bob Blakely and Gus and

468
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,279
Dorothy and and and that was really

469
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,738
great the small and intimate also had

470
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,480
another side I gave at that first

471
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:37,710
conference I get my first paper and it

472
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,960
was on covert channels which then became

473
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,029
subliminal channels for the crypto

474
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,159
people and then now I now its side

475
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,529
channels and so I don't know what it'll

476
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,200
be next but anyway I gave my paper on

477
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:53,580
covert channels and I remember someone

478
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,149
stood up in the audience and said so who

479
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,009
cares

480
00:22:54,149 --> 00:23:01,080
I mean loudly said so who cares from the

481
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:04,019
other side two or three people stood up

482
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,480
and said we do okay and I said okay

483
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:08,820
don't fight you know let's let me answer

484
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,419
the other questions okay and we'll go on

485
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,340
that was it

486
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:16,649
and absolutely absolutely it was how

487
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,408
many of you just raised your hand how

488
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:22,590
many of you have been to crypto at the

489
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:24,509
Clairemont no security privacy I declare

490
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:28,918
security Krotz privacy at the Clairemont

491
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:31,799
sorry not many the rest of you are

492
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,749
really missing it how many of you that

493
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,289
were not at security and privacy at the

494
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:39,869
Clairemont have been to the Clairemont

495
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:41,749
okay I next time you come here it's

496
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:44,399
coming in San Francisco next year again

497
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:46,350
please take an extra day or an extra

498
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:48,479
afternoon and drive over the Claremont

499
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,730
Frank Lloyd Wright designed that

500
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,980
building and when we move when we had

501
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,679
the early cripples in there it was in

502
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,230
pretty rough shape remember you had to

503
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,929
take a shower early because the hot

504
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,600
water didn't last long and and then they

505
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,210
and then

506
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,610
made it much better and we after the

507
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,950
first decrypt those we always had a

508
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,049
problem with it was it was too big we

509
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,289
were limited to 300 and then we put the

510
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:19,900
chairs in the back we were limited to

511
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:22,870
320 and actually in 1989 at the business

512
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,419
meeting they said you know we were

513
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:29,260
oversubscribed you know we're turning

514
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:31,990
people away you know and I stood up and

515
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,169
said good okay and then they said well

516
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:37,000
how are we going to I said we should

517
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:40,299
turn people away we should be selective

518
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,909
they said well how will be selective you

519
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:44,440
know and I don't know who suggested it

520
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:46,150
might have might have been teri said

521
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,150
well we need a czar and they said well

522
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,429
who will be the Czar and I said I'll be

523
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,260
the Czar and I said and you should tell

524
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:55,929
everybody desire I said I'll decide who

525
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,750
comes and who doesn't come you know and

526
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:00,220
when they can't come you tell him that

527
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,440
it was dick camera who said they

528
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:07,090
couldn't come iced out oh I'll take the

529
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,610
heat 1989 there there's a guy there's a

530
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,189
guy who started tea is named Steve

531
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,229
Walker who also was responsible for

532
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,480
starting the national computer security

533
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,480
center T is was one of the earlier

534
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,900
computer security companies and they did

535
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,280
quite well and and and he did well Steve

536
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,990
any of you who went out wouldn't know

537
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,549
that he was a cheap son of a gun

538
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:33,159
okay but he knew I was R so he told all

539
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:35,620
of his people that they could go because

540
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,659
he knew dick Kemmerer would tell a

541
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,059
select few of them you know some number

542
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:43,240
of them they couldn't go that year we

543
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:45,549
were not oversubscribed because of the

544
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,490
economy we had less than 300 people that

545
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:49,389
applied and the Czar didn't have to turn

546
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,600
anybody away

547
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,640
okay half from that day on until he

548
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,418
passed when I saw Steve Walker he always

549
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,409
referred to me as a toothless czar

550
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,419
because I didn't because I didn't turn

551
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:02,980
anybody away I have one one more thing

552
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:05,320
to tell you by the way we had lots of

553
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,750
time because we have a timer up here and

554
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,870
it says 1600 and I know that means four

555
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,590
o'clock right hasn't changed since we

556
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,429
came up here yeah we're still okay

557
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,600
anyway one one more

558
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,610
19 in the as the Clermont got nicer the

559
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,520
prices went up and going to de Clermont

560
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:27,040
and in fact all of the military folks

561
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,750
had to go which means like naval

562
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,030
research labs and stuff stayed down at

563
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,690
Grandma's yeah and then came up for the

564
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:37,540
for the meetings in in nineteen eighty

565
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,430
nine we decided to move crypto I say we

566
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,340
did you know decided a business meeting

567
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:45,940
and Tom bearson actually had a contract

568
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,220
not crypto is security privacy I'm sorry

569
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,500
just just do a search of my place

570
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,240
and you're gonna don't mind you like my

571
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,210
grandkids don't listen to what I say

572
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,430
listen to what I mean okay and when

573
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,010
whenever I say crypto

574
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:02,200
I mean security and privacy so in 1989

575
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:07,120
we actually had a contract to have the

576
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,670
1990 security and privacy symposium okay

577
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,489
and since it was 1990 okay I won't go

578
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,500
there anyway we had a contract for that

579
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,530
and at the last day of the conference

580
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,850
Tom Burson came in and he had told the

581
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,149
people at the Clermont we were leaving

582
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:25,750
and Tom bearson is a guy who always did

583
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:29,830
our contracts for us and he came in and

584
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,750
the Clairemont said that we could come

585
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,100
there they would match the price and

586
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,260
they would pay the penalty for us

587
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,300
pulling out of Portland and so we

588
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,220
actually would have left the we would

589
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,840
have left the Clermont for the 1990

590
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,830
conference other than a Tom bearson

591
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,730
working for us yes go I have another

592
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,100
question for you guys

593
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,300
because we have another ten minutes and

594
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,899
then we're going to open the question to

595
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:55,629
the public but we talked about community

596
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,130
security and privacy was really a forum

597
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,550
where people would get together it was a

598
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,130
much smaller group one of I mean I have

599
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:06,280
great memories from the early days my

600
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:09,370
early days which are late 90s so I don't

601
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:13,450
compare but I can tell you everybody

602
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:16,419
who's a young grad student here take

603
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:19,720
pictures because 40 years from now you

604
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,520
will be able to blackmail people in the

605
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,260
worst possible way so take a lot of

606
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,780
pictures because I have you know

607
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,179
pictures from the 90s that I use

608
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,369
regularly to blackmail random

609
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:33,490
people but the other thing that I want

610
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:37,330
to say is please I would like to hear

611
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:40,049
from the panel about encounters events

612
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:44,439
when you were at this conference were

613
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:46,779
was there an event a meeting somebody

614
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,970
that you talked to that was meaningful

615
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:50,679
and changed the way you look at security

616
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,909
in any possible way Dorothy why don't

617
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:57,340
you get started or didn't change how I

618
00:28:54,909 --> 00:29:00,190
looked at security so much but Peter

619
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,658
became you know close colleague and

620
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,720
eventually I went to work with him at

621
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:08,080
SSRI so that wouldn't have happened if I

622
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,639
hadn't met him at the conference and and

623
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,399
when I went to sorry I worked on

624
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:13,658
intrusion detection with Peter and that

625
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,489
wouldn't have happened either if I

626
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:18,490
hadn't gone there I probably never would

627
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:21,129
have gotten into that area so thank you

628
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,470
fantastic dad so I would say it was a

629
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:27,009
series of encounters and going back to

630
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,619
that time period introvert very shy

631
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:30,549
which is not the same as introvert

632
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,470
somebody wasn't gonna push her way

633
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,779
forward a lot of the people here

634
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,340
believed in me and asked me to take

635
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:38,499
charge of various things which was

636
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,320
totally shocking but I couldn't say no

637
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:43,299
because I was an introvert and shy those

638
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,059
kinds have trouble saying no so I

639
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:48,190
learned a lot from the more senior

640
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:49,720
people here pulling me in into areas

641
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,950
that I didn't think I had any business

642
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,980
and then of course that's been very

643
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,980
helpful

644
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:59,769
other than being the person met who who

645
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:02,049
did you encounter I would say that my

646
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,840
association with Hilda Faust who was

647
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:08,320
head of security before you long before

648
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:11,559
you was really instrumental and that

649
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,678
goes back to 1973 when we started this

650
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,249
provably secure stuff fun formal methods

651
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:20,019
and hardware design and so on and and

652
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:23,499
then all of the interactions with some

653
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:26,649
of the cryptographers wit in particular

654
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:30,850
has been friend and colleague for many

655
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:33,800
many years and curmudgeon and wonderful

656
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:39,679
guy to have around we have a

657
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:42,760
monthly crypto lunch it Azariah that was

658
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:46,040
started by Marty Hellman and it moved to

659
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,440
Park and Tom bearson and Teresa lund

660
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,649
were involved in it and I took it over

661
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,470
when when that didn't work anymore and

662
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,720
so this whole idea of getting

663
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,970
cryptographers together with system

664
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,430
people was something that that really

665
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,370
was important to me and and i mentioned

666
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,800
already the the 81-82

667
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,520
episodes awesome big do you have

668
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,820
something well sure well I met Dorothy I

669
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:17,480
believe in 1982 at the had crypto and in

670
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,480
1983 she sent me an email and said I've

671
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,220
been invited to give a talk on computer

672
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,840
security she had been invited to give a

673
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,960
talk on computer security at love in

674
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,199
Belgium she had a conflict and she said

675
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,450
could you go and give the talk and I

676
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,250
said okay yeah Leuven Belgium over

677
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,110
Christmas yeah okay I'll do it

678
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,450
you know I said to my wife is what you

679
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:42,560
want to go and we went what she didn't

680
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:45,950
tell me is that every other person at

681
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,950
that conference was a crippled person it

682
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:52,370
was basically a cryptography conference

683
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,110
and dick camera giving giving a talk on

684
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,949
computer and network security and I

685
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,850
loved it it was great so it actually

686
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,980
springboarded me to get even tighter

687
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:05,270
with in with the European part of the

688
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:08,510
crypto community I have another round of

689
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,820
question very historical days so you

690
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,060
were there at the very beginning how do

691
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:16,909
you think this concept of openness has

692
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,710
changed through times or how was it at

693
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,810
that time nowadays we see a lot of

694
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:24,500
presentations that I always end up and

695
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:26,720
my code is on github it's almost now you

696
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,030
know mandatory to share your code your

697
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,510
results but first of all there is no

698
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:35,360
github at the time but also there was

699
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:38,210
government concerns and other aspects

700
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,860
that play in an important role in the

701
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,520
openness of the sharing and I thought

702
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:45,199
there was a lot of discussion between

703
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,270
security through obscurity versus

704
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,910
openness so how was a Devere

705
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,730
beginning of this conference I think

706
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:55,429
from the beginning it was clear to most

707
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:58,450
of us that security by obscurity didn't

708
00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:03,250
work and the only alternative was

709
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:06,620
openness and so I never felt there was a

710
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:14,120
conflict there I gave a talk at NASA and

711
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:18,399
NATO in Brussels actually no probably in

712
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:21,949
90s on the importance of not using

713
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:25,550
proprietary crap where you'll pardon the

714
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:27,260
expression yeah and that also goes back

715
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,169
to 84 when I started worrying about

716
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,800
electronic voting systems and election

717
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,929
integrity where it's the vendors who

718
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,820
have proprietary systems with no audit

719
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:44,360
trails and no ability to remediate

720
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:47,450
disasters failures in elections because

721
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:51,229
they have been claiming their

722
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,510
proprietary honest and so that very much

723
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,360
way way back in the 80s when I was

724
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:58,910
working with the city of New York which

725
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,770
is trying to acquire twenty four million

726
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,460
dollars worth of voting machines that

727
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:06,860
were garbage yeah it was clear that the

728
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,570
openness was absolutely fundamental

729
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,149
since the very beginning you found that

730
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,940
was it was a tie Northy well in the

731
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:17,029
early eighties I was at Purdue at the

732
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,369
time Matt Bishop was PhD student I was

733
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,460
his advisor and Matt was doing a lot of

734
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:24,619
vulnerability analysis and unix and he

735
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,240
did not want to publish that information

736
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:33,830
and so he wrote his reports and we set

737
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,479
them to selected people it wasn't you

738
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,159
know put out in the open he was very

739
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,050
concerned about that so I think the

740
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:43,070
general sense of publishing

741
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:46,399
vulnerabilities was not as widespread as

742
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:49,630
it is now yeah I mentioned one thing for

743
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,940
dick Kemmer who wrote

744
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:55,420
the five volumes of formal met this

745
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:59,530
stuff I mentioned to Deb at lunch that

746
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:04,360
NSA had made those for official use only

747
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:08,410
no foreign four years good rule is

748
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:11,410
probably yeah but I in that response

749
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:14,770
there I had a paper that a student and I

750
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:16,720
rode and he used to be a IT the

751
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:20,259
operating systems guy for the department

752
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,640
plus was also a student around that time

753
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:27,790
and early to mid 80s and on UNIX

754
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,980
security and basically started out of a

755
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:34,450
class project where I said here's all of

756
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,100
the UNIX flaws that I know about now

757
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,379
find others you know understand those

758
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,650
and find him and in that paper we

759
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,080
actually identified the flaws wrote code

760
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,810
to fix the flaws and distribute it to

761
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,299
people like Sun Microsystems which gives

762
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,310
you an idea when it was but we never

763
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,050
that that could have been in Oakland

764
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:57,130
paper and we never published it because

765
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,260
we didn't want to publish flaws and so

766
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:02,200
what happened is like I said we gave it

767
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,990
to the Sun out to Sun and they actually

768
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,939
put it in a system but then I used to

769
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,399
teach about that every class every year

770
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:12,550
to my undergraduate class after that and

771
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,620
I'd say here's a paper here's a flaws

772
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,570
I'm not going to show you the fixes or

773
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,549
whatever but go and try it well at first

774
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,550
I didn't show them the flaws but then

775
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,750
later on I showed him the flaws and

776
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,730
after a few years they came back and

777
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,520
they said hey they all work or a number

778
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,020
of them work so somehow in the updating

779
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,720
a system that got a new version or

780
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,480
whatever they no longer updated them and

781
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,240
so I decided at that time that I'm not

782
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,200
going to hold back you know knowing

783
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,750
about vulnerabilities now know you'll

784
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,850
know that we don't go out and broadcast

785
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,490
it right away like many people but we'll

786
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,049
cut we'd contact whoever it was and say

787
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,299
here are the flaws you know you oughta

788
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,730
we want to give you time to go and fix

789
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,160
them before we announce it but holding

790
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,750
them back forever you can you can find

791
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,990
that paper looked up

792
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:05,170
Anthony Anthony de scole Oh and Kemmer

793
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:07,000
and the papers quoted all over the place

794
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,010
because I sent it to all of the

795
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,260
academics that went to security and

796
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:15,310
privacy at that time which was what

797
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,080
about that many right and and so people

798
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:21,040
would quote it but it was never actually

799
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:23,380
published then I think that in fact

800
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,220
what's interesting is that I've gone

801
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,080
from wholly engaged in things being open

802
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,720
to really understanding some of the

803
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:35,170
nuances behind when you want to keep

804
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,029
things secret or private it takes a huge

805
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,820
amount of effort to keep something truly

806
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:42,460
secret right so this isn't the kind of

807
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,260
decision you should make lightly but

808
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,880
when we talk about krai becae a lot of

809
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,430
what we're discussing is keeping

810
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,800
information secret about an individual

811
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,450
often that might cause harm or we look

812
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,190
at industry we're looking at something

813
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,660
that someone needs to keep secret for

814
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,000
this health of their business so they

815
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,819
need it for a commercial reason so I do

816
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,800
think there are reasons that should be

817
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,500
thought through for when you do withhold

818
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,420
a problem that you found but you

819
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,250
shouldn't just do it for the knee jerk

820
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,580
right you shouldn't just do it because

821
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,950
it'll make someone angry but you had all

822
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:17,470
you also need to consider the impact of

823
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,990
releasing that secret so for instance in

824
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,879
some of the papers I've seen here I've

825
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,290
been really pleased to see in particular

826
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,210
with some of the side channel work

827
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,580
there's been coordination with those

828
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,170
that release the hardware there are some

829
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,330
of the flaws that are discovered that

830
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,220
are so devastating that large chunks of

831
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,950
our critical infrastructure can be taken

832
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,069
down and I firmly believe that it is not

833
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:41,470
effective or prudent or to my mind my

834
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,540
personal code of ethics would would keep

835
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,459
would prevent me even if I were an open

836
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,259
researcher and not an NSA research

837
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,050
director from policing that

838
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,030
and similarly data that causes harm to

839
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,280
people we've seen a lot of work

840
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:57,670
presented at this meeting that looks

841
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,920
over what it's possible to elicit from a

842
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,350
model and so what we've learned as a

843
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,200
community here in the last few years and

844
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,690
especially today and yesterday is that

845
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,279
even these models that we generate that

846
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,110
look fair

847
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,650
benign and youthful classification

848
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:15,810
purposes could be if miss applied used

849
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,730
to enable somebody to pull information

850
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:20,190
out about someone violating their

851
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,160
personal privacy causing harm to them

852
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,980
and yet I'm also an advocacy advocate

853
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,379
for transparency and I'm also a breast

854
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,090
cancer survivor who partly thrives

855
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,150
because of people sharing medical

856
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,400
information right so there are a huge

857
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,290
number of nuances and so I can't come

858
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,690
down cleanly and say always yes always

859
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:41,370
no but I will say that one needs to

860
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,200
think it through and have a rubric and

861
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,630
consider in our own ethics as

862
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,549
professionals and then in the individual

863
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,310
disciplines when do you release

864
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,650
information do we ever stop releasing

865
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,360
models do we wait till we find out if

866
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,830
they can be reverse engineered or not or

867
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,350
do we continue down the machine learning

868
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,090
path what is it that we need to do as a

869
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:02,310
community so I think that that

870
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:04,350
particular question it's been around

871
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,690
since the beginning we've all wrestled

872
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:08,520
with it and come in different places

873
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,960
everyone in this audience is wrestling

874
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,390
with that question and you will never

875
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,850
stop because we're always going to find

876
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,220
ways that things will leak or give harm

877
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,860
and we're also the relaxed of releasing

878
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,450
information will cause harm comment I

879
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,700
think the due diligence stuff is has

880
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,779
really taken hold in in Oakland

881
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,700
conferences and in other words we have

882
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,170
we spent about two and a half years on

883
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,589
the thunderclap paper which was

884
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:38,610
presented in February and in DSS that's

885
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:41,460
the the direct memory access Iowa new

886
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:49,110
problems and iterating with with the the

887
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:51,600
guilty parties that's very interesting I

888
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:54,180
would like to open actually the question

889
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,470
to the to the crowd so if you want to

890
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,660
ask a question please come to the

891
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:00,779
Microsoft at Microsoft the microphones

892
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,299
now Microsoft it's much its crypto come

893
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,980
to the crypto

894
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,750
listen know what it means now Micro

895
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,090
exactly

896
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:11,190
yeah it was a wonderful panel

897
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,590
I'm bhavani tracing him from University

898
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:16,860
of Texas at Dallas and I mean in

899
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:19,380
cybersecurity since 1985 fall you know

900
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,180
when I was at Honeywell and

901
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:26,150
panel brought me so many wonderful

902
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:30,060
memories my first Auckland was 1986 of

903
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:34,560
SNP conference and I can vividly

904
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:37,200
remember Dorothy talking about a paper

905
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,900
on poly instantiation views for

906
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,689
classification and then you discuss poly

907
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,700
instantiation present in the view graphs

908
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,010
those transparencies and then you had

909
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,259
these flip things that you showed when

910
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,350
multiple users can have different views

911
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,100
at different levels and so poly

912
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:58,200
instantiation was a big thing in the

913
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:01,319
1980s and early 1990s we used to call it

914
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,990
the P word and it even became a little

915
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,280
bit ugly and I think Peter you might

916
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:09,540
have been there at the Franconia

917
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,950
workshop when there was a panel and I

918
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,320
don't know you sort of got frustrated

919
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:16,290
and I think you ended the panel and said

920
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:21,120
that's it we have to stop now so it

921
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:31,050
reaches fun I say Peter yes quite famous

922
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:32,970
for the over overlays and we worked

923
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,710
closely with the Dorothy and Peter and

924
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,529
the SR I team because Honeywell we had

925
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,740
won the contract from the air force and

926
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:43,050
so did a sister project is Dorothy and

927
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,089
her team had won the contract Honeywell

928
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:47,640
team was at that time they'd by elbow

929
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:49,440
Bert and so we used to have you know

930
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,690
discussions then we would meet at

931
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,270
Auckland and so that was just such a

932
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:57,780
memorable that sort of got me into you

933
00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:00,990
know cybersecurity and Dorothy was or

934
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:03,510
she still is the queen of cybersecurity

935
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:08,419
and now we are so grateful we have also

936
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:11,610
someone like Deb in addition to Dorothy

937
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,430
and of course dick we you know we used

938
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,740
to meet at ifip conference it was in

939
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,569
London Halifax and we had some

940
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,729
interesting discussions anyway so that

941
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:23,490
was really you know it brought so many

942
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:26,580
good memories I think I wanted to a

943
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:29,879
question I wanted to ask you know ok we

944
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:31,740
were wondering this very briefly ok so

945
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,210
you know my husband and I you know back

946
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,160
and forth we talk he's a material

947
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,870
scientist he was a professor at MIT for

948
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,210
many years now he has a startup

949
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:41,850
sometimes he gets so frustrated and he

950
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,980
keeps telling me oh you guys you know if

951
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,830
the professor's become hackers and the

952
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:49,560
hackers become professors the world

953
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,720
would be a safer place I think it's

954
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,150
happening actually fun but there's still

955
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,790
no a question what things my question

956
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,890
then is why do I mean saying all this

957
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,320
money that they are spending and what

958
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,509
are you guys doing he uses even a bad

959
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,520
word sometimes causes frauds for taking

960
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:09,210
money and not doing much and the hackers

961
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,370
are winning so why do I tell two people

962
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,800
like my husband I mean I've been married

963
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:16,350
to him for 44 years I was 20 when I got

964
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,030
married so I can't leave him so what do

965
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,980
I do

966
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:22,290
perfect panel do you have a question

967
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:29,760
where we're losing the war have you

968
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:32,220
considered divorce since I was 19 plus

969
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,760
so it's 44 years so of course it's out

970
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:40,339
of the question

971
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:43,440
right yeah panel do you have a view so

972
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:45,600
unfortunately much of security is an

973
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,490
arms race and the arms race doesn't stop

974
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:56,569
just because you get momentarily on hit

975
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:56,569
ahead that's a Disney movie momentarily

976
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:06,330
we will always be playing leapfrog in

977
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,660
different areas yes yeah and I agree

978
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,819
with that

979
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,830
you know thank God the problem will not

980
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:14,910
be solved so it will still be here and

981
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:17,819
doing our job being frauds Paul Pavan oh

982
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,799
 it's a question for Dorothy so if

983
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,540
you were learning cryptography in the

984
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,250
80s yeah you read the diffie-hellman

985
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,040
paper and then the heiress a paper and

986
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,290
well that was all there was and then

987
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,270
your professor gave you this book called

988
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:32,340
cryptography and data security and we

989
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,050
all read the first half of it and we our

990
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,750
heads were so full we never got really

991
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,880
to the second half but it was about

992
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,960
statistical inference and I was

993
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,600
wondering about your comment your

994
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,830
thoughts about with what you've seen in

995
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,540
the last 10 years about you know

996
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,259
anonymization of data sets and all the

997
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,020
rest

998
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,330
um how that compares to what you had

999
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:54,750
already written about back in the early

1000
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:59,250
eighties I really haven't been following

1001
00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:01,320
all the research since then so you know

1002
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,790
the terminology has changed over the

1003
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,710
time we used to refer to it a

1004
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,750
statistical database security I guess

1005
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:11,609
now people are calling a differential

1006
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:15,510
privacy but yeah I as I haven't been

1007
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:18,270
reading those papers so can't tell you

1008
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:23,040
too much there's another questions the

1009
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:24,630
question hi thank you guys for being

1010
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,119
here I really respect the wisdom that

1011
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:30,869
you're sharing today there's been a lot

1012
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,430
said about the past decades and even one

1013
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:34,619
of the previous questions referred to

1014
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:36,810
the arms race that were currently seems

1015
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:41,100
like we're falling behind on I was

1016
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:43,470
curious if you had some insight into the

1017
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,480
most important problems we could be

1018
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,000
focusing on solving within the next ten

1019
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,730
years so sort of the things that are

1020
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,070
existential threats to the internet and

1021
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:57,990
other things that you think are the most

1022
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:59,970
important for us to prioritize III come

1023
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:03,000
back to the notion of trustworthy

1024
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:05,189
systems I see all of the hype about the

1025
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,720
Internet of Things and the hype about

1026
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,869
deep learning and all the stuff and I

1027
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,899
keep worrying about the fact that when

1028
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:18,150
you're doing life critical systems you

1029
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,490
used to read the Microsoft shrink-wrap

1030
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,670
which says don't use this in critical

1031
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:28,049
systems and yet it is in critical

1032
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:33,869
systems everywhere when you start

1033
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:36,960
throwing the undetermined istic AIS

1034
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:39,540
things into life critical systems I

1035
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,030
think the risk problem there is enormous

1036
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:46,950
and I think that may be the driving

1037
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:49,170
force in answer to your question all

1038
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,910
right that one wanted to do something so

1039
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,040
I guess there's two categories of

1040
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,410
answers to your question one is the

1041
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,450
magic wand if I would fix if it were

1042
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,379
possible to do the magical piece and

1043
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,189
there's the other that where I think

1044
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,930
that we

1045
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,460
genuinely could make good progress I'm

1046
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,620
only saying it that way because there's

1047
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,750
a certain set of answers I would give if

1048
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,870
we could just fix it if we could have if

1049
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,430
we could have perfect security in all of

1050
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,470
the systems everywhere that doesn't fix

1051
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,660
everything but it fixes a lot of things

1052
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,950
because everybody's got a different idea

1053
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,330
as to what they want that computer to do

1054
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,250
I and the hacker have a really different

1055
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,410
opinion as to how we want the other

1056
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,610
thread goes back to the old Einstein

1057
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,339
quote everything should be made as

1058
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:28,860
simple as possible but no simpler and

1059
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,390
it's the no simpler that's killing us in

1060
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,380
the sense that we keep forgetting

1061
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:35,819
exception conditions we keep forgetting

1062
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:38,180
Cobert channel side channels whatever

1063
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:41,520
you want to call them we keep forgetting

1064
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:43,379
the the whole system again like I've

1065
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,860
said this three times now but I think it

1066
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:51,240
is really a driving force for for

1067
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:53,130
critical systems in particular something

1068
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,220
very different I had breakfast with a

1069
00:48:53,130 --> 00:49:00,300
woman named Jennifer today and she's

1070
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:04,290
looking at how to teach cybersecurity to

1071
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,090
K through 12 and I think education is a

1072
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:08,640
big thing I think we have to educate the

1073
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:12,360
people and I think we should start at K

1074
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,569
through 12 yeah give him so far as far

1075
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:19,430
as the topics to go do research on I

1076
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:24,300
gave all of those to our lab already

1077
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:26,250
alright and I think that the two trend

1078
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,170
the two trends go together meaning that

1079
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:32,580
as we may see technology more secure

1080
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,800
security becomes a people problem more

1081
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,990
than a technology problem so education

1082
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,370
good point

1083
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:43,439
you disagree fantastic why because the

1084
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:47,130
technology is moving faster than we can

1085
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,080
understand it if technology sat still

1086
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:51,090
yes we could solve the technology

1087
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,560
promise but it's not sitting still well

1088
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:55,140
so to say we can we'll never solve it

1089
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:00,600
technology people what we shouldn't

1090
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:02,490
educate is a big issue - ok it's a big

1091
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,470
issue but to think that we can solve the

1092
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,759
technology piece I think it's just crazy

1093
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,240
no no I think you're misunderstanding

1094
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,420
the comment which is that because the

1095
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,740
complexity is getting

1096
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,710
great in the technology is moving so

1097
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,479
fast the people can't keep up with it no

1098
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:21,130
we can't but the researchers can't keep

1099
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,799
up with it either that's right I agree

1100
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:26,049
but I was saying as we for example I'm

1101
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:29,619
looking at Windows we were there was

1102
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:31,450
it's fantastic Matthias Lee's slide show

1103
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:35,559
that brought back Commodore 64 I was

1104
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:38,319
almost crying but Windows 95 has become

1105
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:41,500
Windows 10 and now of course that has

1106
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,569
become a lot more protected against

1107
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,450
certain types of attacks and we will see

1108
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:49,509
we are seeing cyber criminals focusing

1109
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:51,848
more on social engineering and attacking

1110
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:53,920
the user because actually just hacking

1111
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:55,960
the technology has become harder not

1112
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,119
impossible but just harder and we will

1113
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,270
see always the shifting in tactic in

1114
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,309
tactics from you know attacking there or

1115
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,990
hacking the computer to hacking the user

1116
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:07,390
that's that's what I was trying to say

1117
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,919
but there is no sorry I guess I want to

1118
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,868
add one more piece to that because I

1119
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,280
think there's another bit that ties to

1120
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:17,260
your comment cyber security privacy none

1121
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,140
of it really is a technology problem

1122
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:22,839
because it's how we people choose to use

1123
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,940
the technology I witness I would say

1124
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:26,710
that even if we fix the technology right

1125
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,390
now there would be differences of

1126
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,799
opinions in this room in terms of how we

1127
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,259
would use everything there would be

1128
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:34,270
people not inside this room outside

1129
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,069
who'd want to use computers to do harm

1130
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:38,200
to one another there is not going to be

1131
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:40,630
any way that you can maintain freedom of

1132
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,490
ability to use technology and prevent

1133
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:45,010
people from using in an inappropriate

1134
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:47,109
way from someone's perspective and so

1135
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:48,430
you can say there are things we can fix

1136
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:50,470
about technology that will make it

1137
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,868
easier for us to make certain principles

1138
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:55,029
and practices occur but if you stop with

1139
00:51:52,869 --> 00:51:56,770
that then you've got nothing because

1140
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:59,109
you've got to have the societal in

1141
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:01,750
decision about what needs to happen what

1142
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:04,000
kinds of information do we want to share

1143
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:06,190
that's just as important as how do we

1144
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,500
share it so it's all critical but if we

1145
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:10,390
only say the technology or only the

1146
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,180
people we lose sight of the fact that

1147
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:16,660
it's systems of people living in a globe

1148
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:19,450
with different yep at least for one last

1149
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:22,299
question please we're running out of

1150
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,828
time so we have to get one more question

1151
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:26,259
keep it short so I'm Greg Shannon from

1152
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:28,179
Carnegie Mellon University and the

1153
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:30,579
question I have will will be in the

1154
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:31,959
context of can you say one sentence of

1155
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:33,489
roughly ten words an answer to the

1156
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:35,348
question but first a little background

1157
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:37,900
you know because of this conference I

1158
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:39,849
was able to serve in the White House of

1159
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,769
a last administration in the Office of

1160
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:43,709
Science Technology Policy and what

1161
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:46,959
really struck me there was at the time

1162
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:47,678
all three world leaders were worried

1163
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:49,209
about cybersecurity

1164
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,660
and they were talking about it regularly

1165
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:54,640
I don't know if you recall the 2015

1166
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,828
cybersecurity summit that President

1167
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,009
Obama held out in the bay area here at

1168
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:01,869
Stanford and it continues to be a topic

1169
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:05,439
so if you could give ten words they

1170
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:07,929
present you have the president of you

1171
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:10,089
know all three world leading countries

1172
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:11,829
in the same room and you're going to

1173
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:17,529
give them 10 words about what needs to

1174
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:20,469
be done what would you say all right

1175
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:22,479
that's that's a toughy everything

1176
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:30,130
everything should be made as simple as

1177
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:30,500
possible but no simpler sorry thanks

1178
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:34,019
brother

1179
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:38,709
[Laughter]

1180
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:46,149
Stephan there's 10 more minutes

1181
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:49,029
apparently I completely understand what

1182
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:51,519
caused this so here's my question when

1183
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:53,199
the conference started it seemed like

1184
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,118
there was very much a sense that you

1185
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,069
wanted to make things secure and that

1186
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,809
that was a concrete state of being

1187
00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:04,719
secure and otherwise insecure unlike a

1188
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:07,479
lot of fields of engineering where we

1189
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,039
have a notion of how what the objective

1190
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:10,448
function is and how close we are getting

1191
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,939
to approaching the Gulf secure versus

1192
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:15,729
insecure is a pretty brittle scenario

1193
00:54:12,939 --> 00:54:17,140
and so I routinely find myself in a role

1194
00:54:15,729 --> 00:54:18,098
where I'm talking to someone industry

1195
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,019
and they say look they're all these

1196
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,219
things we can do and we can do CFI we

1197
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:25,149
can do intrusion detection we do this

1198
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:29,939
but I can't do everything so how should

1199
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:32,739
I reason about how much security I get

1200
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:34,920
for all of these different technologies

1201
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:38,790
and ideas I'm just curious if

1202
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,829
had any idea the how much of a quagmire

1203
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:45,920
that would be when you guys started

1204
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:48,450
doing this I want I'd like to put a

1205
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,690
stamp on this one

1206
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:54,149
in the sense that in the 80s we were

1207
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:57,480
worried gravely about multi-level

1208
00:54:54,150 --> 00:55:00,720
security even in the 70s and it was a

1209
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,619
fundamental issue for a large chunk of

1210
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,990
the security community at that time

1211
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:09,990
today if you look back on it you realize

1212
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:12,089
you can't have anything that comes close

1213
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,890
to multi-level security because you

1214
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:15,210
can't trust the hardware you can't dress

1215
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,848
the software you can't dress the

1216
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,500
compilers you can't trust the people you

1217
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:26,609
can have all the polygraphs you want

1218
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:28,799
it's still not good enough the answers

1219
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:30,808
probably no I don't I think that a lot

1220
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:34,349
of us believed that really if we could

1221
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:35,490
solve that systems problem that we that

1222
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:37,740
the rest of it would come out in the

1223
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,689
wash and then we went into an era of

1224
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:42,990
living with insecurity and layers and

1225
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:44,670
the rest dad yeah back then we could

1226
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:47,839
solve it I mean the orange book gave us

1227
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:50,250
the model of what we needed to do and

1228
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,980
but it didn't work out didn't work in

1229
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:54,990
the work because nobody wanted systems

1230
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,910
that could conform to that model that's

1231
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,220
right yeah get out - absolutely yeah you

1232
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,730
just had to give up all usability that's

1233
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,959
right

1234
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:05,760
and as you're aware Stefan when once we

1235
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,589
realize you weren't gonna try to get a

1236
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,740
completely secure system that that

1237
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:13,859
wasn't really doable things were a lot

1238
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:16,919
better not better in terms of security

1239
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:20,790
but just in terms of the work we were

1240
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,500
doing sanity there was one more question

1241
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,790
I mean a couple of more questions okay

1242
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,950
hi

1243
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:29,940
so not to leave you mind introducing

1244
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:33,210
yourself I'm Oliver Ellingson cocoa at

1245
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:35,440
the moment so know somebody's changing

1246
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:40,160
jobs yeah

1247
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,839
yes not to end things on a down note so

1248
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:45,078
we've heard about husbands who call

1249
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:47,119
people frauds and we've heard that Peter

1250
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:51,109
says we've never been ahead and that

1251
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,630
it's hard to measure things in your sort

1252
00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:56,240
of perspective looking back what are the

1253
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:59,869
successes that have come out of this

1254
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:04,189
community and this conference in the 40

1255
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:05,680
years Nick you want to take this one

1256
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:09,140
yeah go on

1257
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:12,019
I think the biggest thing is the

1258
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:15,379
awareness that point solutions to point

1259
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:19,819
problems don't solve the big picture

1260
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:21,680
problems I think the big thing comes out

1261
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:24,140
of any conferences the relationships

1262
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,269
that are formed other people that I've

1263
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,500
met and collaborated with opportunities

1264
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:29,660
that came up because of those

1265
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,470
relationships very good point

1266
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:36,828
yeah that I think it has empowered the

1267
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:39,109
work here industry to build things that

1268
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:41,720
do make us safer at home not perfectly

1269
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:43,400
safe but against a different level of

1270
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,078
hackers should you choose to use the

1271
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,819
security that's available you can

1272
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,309
actually do a lot better job now than

1273
00:57:46,819 --> 00:57:50,569
you could in the 80s not against nation

1274
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:52,970
state but if you take it down to

1275
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:55,940
something like your neighborhood your

1276
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:57,769
neighborhood pests or attacks on

1277
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:00,559
business you can do a lot more so and

1278
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:02,508
yes yet home routers are easily yeah

1279
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,490
it's a burden and interestingly enough

1280
00:58:02,509 --> 00:58:05,509
it still all works so somebody was

1281
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,890
reassure I don't know if they were

1282
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:08,900
trying to be reassuring or not but they

1283
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:10,400
told me there would be lots of disasters

1284
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,259
to come and we would survive each one

1285
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,180
because it was a system of systems and

1286
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:16,940
we had built enough redundancy in that

1287
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,200
we would go through so I think the fact

1288
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,630
that we're all still here despite

1289
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,730
warning of disaster for 40 years is

1290
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,859
telling that something good must have

1291
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,059
come because they either that or

1292
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:29,299
somebody's holding think something

1293
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:31,970
really awful for this evening I I think

1294
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:33,849
I want to briefly add to this I think

1295
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:38,629
that an outcome that it's very difficult

1296
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:40,549
to measure is the level of sort of like

1297
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:42,380
check and balances that this community

1298
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:45,079
did with respect to what's out there in

1299
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,329
the world I think that we don't realize

1300
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:48,109
that sometimes you think oh you know CFI

1301
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:50,719
it's

1302
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:52,569
that's a real result that has been

1303
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:55,190
incorporated but there is also a general

1304
00:58:52,569 --> 00:58:58,190
fact that this community looked at many

1305
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:00,440
system that were deployed voting system

1306
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:03,349
cars system airplane system and say hey

1307
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,690
this is broken and I'm gonna give I'm

1308
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:08,539
gonna explain to you in a scientific way

1309
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:10,759
why it's broken and then most of the

1310
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:12,920
time it got better at least somewhat

1311
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:16,160
fixed and that's a I think that's a big

1312
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:21,249
contribution of this community thanks

1313
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,249
what's checks and balance looking at the

1314
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:28,549
US government dude I'm sorry I don't

1315
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:30,529
want to get political look desert house

1316
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:34,160
from Samsung Research America again I

1317
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:36,229
have a second question one problem that

1318
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,509
I've run into in the realm of system

1319
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:40,399
security is that even if someone open

1320
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:42,289
sources their code if they don't

1321
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,119
actively maintain it it'll quickly

1322
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:45,829
become obsolete as the system it was

1323
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,950
applied to gets updated

1324
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:51,380
so then future students or sorry future

1325
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,328
researchers have to then reproduce what

1326
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:55,069
they had and then build on top of that

1327
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:57,499
to have something novel enough to

1328
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:59,420
contribute to the conference do you have

1329
00:59:57,499 --> 01:00:01,698
any advice that we could use to

1330
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,829
incentivize researchers and authors to

1331
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:07,459
maintain their code even if they've open

1332
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:10,249
sourced it so we're living that dream

1333
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:12,109
with deidre now so and that is actually

1334
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:14,180
a really positive thing we deliberately

1335
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:17,598
release Sidra reverse engineering to the

1336
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:19,219
community it is a low-cost high-end tool

1337
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,259
for people to use and learn in

1338
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:23,779
classrooms and elsewhere I think it's a

1339
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:24,979
zero cost yeah zero cost well you're on

1340
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:26,449
your end when you download it and work

1341
01:00:24,979 --> 01:00:29,379
it you've so that you still got a higher

1342
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:31,670
you graduate student so I guess pizza so

1343
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,469
so that's something for you we're

1344
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,319
looking at how we're gonna resource it

1345
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:37,849
so I think that when you release a thing

1346
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,589
and you expect to the community using it

1347
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:41,420
it behooves you to have that plan so

1348
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:43,009
we've got a plan I think for faculty

1349
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,140
it's a bit harder because you don't have

1350
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:46,910
a budget you can just take from and so

1351
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,529
there I do think that looking to

1352
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,479
organizations like National Science

1353
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:52,339
Foundation and while we would like all

1354
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:54,769
of the money to go into funding novelty

1355
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:57,160
sometimes it's worthwhile to invest some

1356
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:59,419
of our scarce science dollars into

1357
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,699
maintaining what's already been achieved

1358
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,119
so that there's that giant to build on

1359
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,980
instead

1360
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:06,140
having to start from scratch it's what

1361
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,819
balance you have and who has it and how

1362
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,710
you disseminate it so it'd be nice if

1363
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:11,269
there was something besides NSF but I

1364
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:13,480
don't know who else to point to that

1365
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:17,779
would be a good reasonable ongoing

1366
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:20,480
activity there are a lot of real-world

1367
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:26,089
problems here used to be that the

1368
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:28,519
airline industry I'm sorry the the

1369
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:30,380
carrier's did a lot of preventive

1370
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:32,660
maintenance they don't do that anymore

1371
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:36,380
we don't do preventative maintenance in

1372
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:41,769
a lot of other disciplines as well and

1373
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:45,829
it's it's this is the the long view the

1374
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:47,058
farsighted notion versus short short

1375
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:51,380
term optimisation

1376
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:54,430
I think the specter meltdown foreshadow

1377
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:57,859
stuff is an example of over your

1378
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:59,419
optimization premature optimization in

1379
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:01,069
the sense that you hadn't really thought

1380
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,359
through or somebody really hadn't

1381
01:02:01,069 --> 01:02:05,029
thought through what the implications

1382
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:06,440
were and it's an iterative process we go

1383
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:08,690
around but but I think at this point

1384
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:12,200
we're not putting enough effort into

1385
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:16,549
into maintenance and and debugging and

1386
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:19,339
and get get the Alf out there and get

1387
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:21,499
first-to-market it's an interesting

1388
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:23,390
thing because in this science the you

1389
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:25,069
require that ongoing maintenance that

1390
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,720
came out of the last question or to

1391
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:30,200
maintain the level of science we think

1392
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,140
we've got and that's not true in areas

1393
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,509
where you don't require equipment to

1394
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:37,759
move with the times but here all of our

1395
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:39,589
defenses need to move with the times and

1396
01:02:37,759 --> 01:02:40,430
we don't have a good way to invest in

1397
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,960
that because it doesn't feel like

1398
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:43,788
science it doesn't feel like something

1399
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,170
that faculty should do it doesn't feel

1400
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:47,180
like something a government agency

1401
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,499
should do for us but yet you don't look

1402
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,109
around and see is there an industry that

1403
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:52,368
wants it I do think that in this area in

1404
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:54,230
other areas of science that are very

1405
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,730
dependent on software and code we have

1406
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,200
got to find a better way to structure

1407
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,710
that and to invest in that as a country

1408
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:03,348
as a globe really interesting well let's

1409
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:05,480
thank the speakers again the panelists

1410
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:07,560
that you'd say that was awesome thank

1411
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:12,930
you very much

1412
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:14,430
mattias I think that we are gonna storm

1413
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:16,770
off yeah

1414
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,270
is that correct yes yes you are all

1415
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:20,070
right let's keep round of claws while

1416
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:21,300
they exit all right thank you

1417
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:27,869
it was great

1418
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:27,869
[Applause]
