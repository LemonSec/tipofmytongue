1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,739
so this talk is this work is with daniel

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,910
ganc and me here ppattani and iran

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,259
trimmer and it's about its what solves

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,730
the problem that i'm sure you've all

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,460
encountered which is what when you

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:27,250
talking to a colleague or a friend or

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,570
whoever over a voice over IP sometimes

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,948
they would appear as if they're not even

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,250
paying attention to the really

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,080
interesting things you're saying and you

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,730
wonder what's happening on the other end

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,400
of the call or they actually you know

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,050
listening to you doing science or just

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,790
scrolling through their feet or whatever

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,250
and so in this situation you're already

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,019
getting Oddy an audio feed from their

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,900
environment right playing if you're on

18
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:54,489
your speakers or headphones but but you

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,900
don't really tell you can't really tell

20
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,769
what's on their screen and this is what

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,390
you're interested in so but the order

22
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,159
that you're getting is coming from a

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,140
microphone that's pretty close to their

24
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:10,408
screen typically and so can you use that

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,060
well it turns out that when screens

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,880
render visual content they emit noise

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,280
and this noise is pretty subtle usually

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,320
we don't mind it but what if this noise

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,670
does have some correspondence with the

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,880
content that's being displayed on your

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,340
screen so if that's true that would

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,589
cause more problems than for board

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,120
colleagues because people do a lot of

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,790
things with their screens a lot of

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,590
private things for example they surf the

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,660
web and they input credit card numbers

37
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,890
they nurture weird obsessions that they

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,090
don't want other people to know about

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:46,120
and all the while there are it's common

40
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,670
to have microphones being placed next to

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,350
swings and it's even common to have them

42
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,540
recording if you're interacting with the

43
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,479
Google home or an Alexa device then it's

44
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,940
recording and if your video chatting and

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,680
or if just the third-party app on your

46
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,460
phone decided to enhance the permission

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,780
to so audio is in a sense it's it's very

48
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,489
available and it's in in some sense it

49
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,670
says strong really it's more strongly

50
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,959
more more highly available than the

51
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,809
electromagnetic leakage that we've seen

52
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:21,159
the famous of a neckla cage that's also

53
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,860
a visual content so to to find out if we

54
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,260
do have this

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,200
leakage of visual content onto audio

56
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,820
signals we drew a zebra on the this on

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,980
the on the display and the zebra is just

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,480
a series of black and white stripes and

59
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,250
we recorded the zebra and we saw and we

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,670
visualized the signal using a

61
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,960
spectrogram which shows the frequencies

62
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,420
through time the frequencies and the

63
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,520
signal and there is in this spectrogram

64
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,380
there is a predominant frequency

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,840
component at four kilohertz now where is

66
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,370
this 4 kilohertz coming from it could be

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,350
coming from the fact that the screen is

68
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,450
rendering content in this raster pattern

69
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:01,730
and it refreshes 60 times a second and

70
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,890
since it has 66 stripes coincidentally

71
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,850
on this screen then the max shows that

72
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,160
it will have it will render 4k stripes

73
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,609
at regular intervals every second so

74
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,280
this 4k and this 4k could be related

75
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:19,070
we're not sure but to find out for sure

76
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,470
we're going to change the stripe width

77
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,959
of the zebra and every time we change

78
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,150
the stripe width we see that on the

79
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,239
visualized audio signal inspecting the

80
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,959
spectrogram the the frequency of

81
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,940
rendering stripes appears so this is

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,190
kind of a smoking barrel for a leak we

83
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,820
know that there is definitely a visual

84
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,230
to audio leak here and so we tested it

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,320
with a bunch of screens and they all

86
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,609
presented the same leak this is just a

87
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,959
few examples on how it looks like with

88
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,110
the different screens but we tested it

89
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,950
with a lot of screens like over I don't

90
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,600
know two dozen at least and more and we

91
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,679
tried to figure out where this is coming

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:04,640
from and we localized the leak to the

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,660
screens power supply and and we we can

94
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,339
conjecture that it's it stems from

95
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,959
different powered power draw of

96
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,290
different values when you render

97
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:22,310
different intensity pixels and we've

98
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,740
seen a similar thing before with in our

99
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,140
own lab with Gandia Natale's 2014

100
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,130
acoustic crypt analysis but that was for

101
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,460
computation not for visual content now

102
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,330
so far the spectrograms I showed were

103
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,698
for lab conditions

104
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,318
but in our attack scenario that I

105
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,979
discussed with the board colleague we

106
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,770
had possibly a webcam microphone or any

107
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:49,740
commodity microphone that the person is

108
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,990
using to video chat with and the audio

109
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,690
was being lost solely compressed and

110
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,259
transmitted over to you over the

111
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:01,530
Internet and so the question is does the

112
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,569
leakage persist over these conditions so

113
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,229
we did the zebra test the exact same

114
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:09,180
test but over as hangouts connection and

115
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,190
we saw that we can still see the

116
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,719
frequency of the zebra in the

117
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:20,099
spectrogram that we visualized and we

118
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:23,039
could even see it when we when we placed

119
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,560
a Google home or an Alexa device next to

120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,990
a screen presented a bunch of

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,490
alternating frequencies zebras and

122
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,270
interacted with with the device Mart

123
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,530
speaker the smart speaker sent our

124
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,568
recordings to the cloud we downloaded

125
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,369
them and we could see the Zebras that

126
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,310
were being displayed on the screen while

127
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,529
we were interacting with Alexa close to

128
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,050
it so it even persists in these

129
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,729
conditions recording the leakage and

130
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,599
observing the EEG was a smartphone was

131
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:53,639
easier and we could also you can even do

132
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:56,340
it at a distance of up to 10 meters and

133
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,870
still with this fancy parabolic mic and

134
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:03,270
still see the zebra frequency in the

135
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,440
spectrogram so what can an attacker do

136
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,299
with it because an attacker is not

137
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,629
interested in zebras they are interested

138
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,500
in maybe extracting the websites that

139
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:16,349
the victim is visiting maybe snoop on

140
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,270
the victims on-screen keyboard and maybe

141
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,860
extract maybe even extract text and

142
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,539
we're going to do all these things and

143
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,669
the way we're going to do all these

144
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,580
things is first I'm going to explain how

145
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,440
we denoise the signal and then I'm going

146
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,029
to go over the attacks one by one and

147
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,250
they all rely heavily on machine

148
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,479
learning

149
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,300
so the noising starts with the

150
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,430
observation that there is a very that

151
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,610
there is a signal that corresponds very

152
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,789
highly to pixel line intensities of

153
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,580
brightness that is in many screens that

154
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,659
we tested we saw the signal modulated on

155
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,830
top of

156
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,720
carrier signal at this in this case a 32

157
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,940
kilohertz carrier signal now when we

158
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,770
demand when the the modulated signal is

159
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:04,260
easier to extract an acquaint the signal

160
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,659
and use that another observation is that

161
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,420
we have a lot of redundancies in this

162
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,810
leakage because the screen refreshes 60

163
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,780
times a second so a natural approach

164
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,300
would be to chop the signal into 60

165
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,250
chops per second and average the chops

166
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,490
and we're supposed to get a much higher

167
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,590
s in our signal from that because the

168
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,640
noise is expected to eliminate and the

169
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:32,580
signal will persist but this has some

170
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,909
challenges we have some unknown measure

171
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,400
of drift that changes with time and so

172
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,050
we can't exactly know where to chop we

173
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,539
have some jitter and anomalous sized

174
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,880
chunks that completely impede an even

175
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,890
attempts of synchronization so and if we

176
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,570
champ if we chop at the wrong places we

177
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,700
might end up eliminating the signal

178
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,140
rather than the noise so we have an

179
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,610
approach to solving that I'm not going

180
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,590
to get into all the details but we do

181
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,530
extract very clean signals and and we do

182
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:02,099
have a very accurate way of chopping the

183
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,450
signal and averaging it okay now I'm

184
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,940
gonna start talking about the attacks

185
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,530
themselves so the first one will be

186
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,350
website distinguishing and website

187
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,789
distinguishing starts with the attacker

188
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,740
displaying a bunch of websites on a

189
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,080
screen on a training screen and he

190
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,550
records the the traces of the screens

191
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,919
while the websites are being displayed

192
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,260
and he attaches the identity of the

193
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,670
website that was displayed on the screen

194
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,680
to every trace of the screen and and

195
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,599
uses this traces to trail in oh and

196
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,930
they're met to train a neural network

197
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,010
that this is what it's expressly trained

198
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:46,680
for to take a signal a trace from the

199
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:50,580
victim screen and until what what web

200
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,239
site the victim was was on and we are

201
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,730
using convolutional neural networks

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,190
those are pretty effective with time

203
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,529
series data which is what we have and we

204
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:05,670
see that this is no

205
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:07,290
we could distinguish what website the

206
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,439
visit the victim is visiting with pretty

207
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,130
high probabilities and in these first

208
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,019
three rows in the table we see the

209
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,290
results for the submission between about

210
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,290
100 websites we even did it with a

211
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:27,719
smartphone and we did it at a distance

212
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:29,399
and the last row shows that the results

213
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,339
for doing it for distinguishing between

214
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:36,449
10 different websites and the activity

215
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,160
of the video chat window and this is

216
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,709
done over the video chat so with the

217
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,199
recordings taken at the other end of the

218
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:47,609
call like in our original attack model

219
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:49,740
okay so now we're gonna talk about the

220
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,459
on-screen snooping attack so this is how

221
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,870
a typical

222
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:56,699
on-screen keyboard looks like the

223
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,449
on-screen keyboards are naturally

224
00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:02,729
considered safe against acoustic

225
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:05,339
emanations from keyboard attacks because

226
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,490
they don't have the same acoustic

227
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:11,699
emanations that mechanical keyboards do

228
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,769
and they are sometimes even required for

229
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,540
example by some some online banking

230
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,449
websites require that you input your

231
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,459
password using a an on-screen keyboard

232
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,829
and so they seem like an interesting

233
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:26,040
target to attack now these on-screen

234
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:27,899
keyboards they have this they typically

235
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,910
have this property that when you press a

236
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,269
key on the keyboard or even when you

237
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,310
hover above it you there is a visual

238
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,260
footprint to that because the user wants

239
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,079
indication of what key is pressing and

240
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,670
so we can apply a very similar attack to

241
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,260
the website distinguishing one except

242
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,910
we're going to distinguish individual

243
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,180
keys and and this works surprisingly

244
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,699
well so for a horizontally laid keyboard

245
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,339
we could figure out the right key and

246
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,979
40% of the time and 70% of the time top

247
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,829
three guest keys and for a portrait

248
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,779
layout keyboard we got very high

249
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,029
accuracy that practically enables us to

250
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,769
extract whole words now extracting whole

251
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,269
words is more complicated because

252
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:13,170
there's because there are some

253
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,810
misclassifications and also because

254
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,620
there is

255
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,510
some ambiguity with clicking the same

256
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,290
key twice that doesn't have a distinct

257
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:26,650
visual footprint but we have this

258
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:29,050
procedure that narrows down the word

259
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,980
that was being typed to live to a

260
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:36,189
shortlist of about ten words and we can

261
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:39,190
and the correct word appears in this

262
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,220
short list a very high percentage of the

263
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,140
time here we got comparable results

264
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,210
attacking with the smartphone and

265
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:53,050
attacking with our high-end equipment

266
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:56,920
sorry and okay now I'm going to talk

267
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,290
about the text extraction attack so text

268
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,270
extraction we can't directly apply a

269
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,150
classifier because we don't exactly know

270
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,500
what request file will output it's an

271
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,970
open world problem so we need a

272
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:12,160
generator we need something more

273
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:13,900
sophisticated but what we did was we we

274
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,449
assume that every character in the text

275
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,130
is in a specific location and we trained

276
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,350
a separate classifier for each location

277
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,990
that regardless to chop the signal up to

278
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,150
the to contain just portion of the bit

279
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,290
of the signal for the classifier

280
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,819
training and we applied error correction

281
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,270
using the fact that the victim is not

282
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,880
typing gibberish it's typing English and

283
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:41,949
specifically words and so our character

284
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,720
accuracies gets pretty high and in over

285
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,790
half of the cases we could extract the

286
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,100
exact word and this is the exact word

287
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,240
out of thousands or tens of thousands of

288
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,380
possibilities so again an open world

289
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,060
there are some limitations to this

290
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,270
attack we use the large amount of space

291
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,069
font and and no one layout but see still

292
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,140
it extracts pretty fine-grained

293
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,089
information and that's nice now the last

294
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,110
thing I want to talk about pretty

295
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:11,440
briefly is is the fact that the the

296
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:14,140
attacker plausibly doesn't have access

297
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,930
to the physical access to the victims

298
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,790
screen so this is probably many many

299
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,859
side-channel attacks so can the attacker

300
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:25,370
train on their own screen

301
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,940
at their leisure and then attack the

302
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,560
victim screen at attack time and for

303
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,650
this we have to train and test on

304
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,489
different screens now is this possible

305
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,750
well maybe because the the at least four

306
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,030
screens of the same model the

307
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,890
correspondence of the signal of the

308
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:47,420
audio signal with the screen content

309
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:50,900
seems very similar and this is even true

310
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,510
when we attack with a different when we

311
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,550
record with a different setup the

312
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,260
correspondence is similar except if we

313
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:04,699
record the distance the signal will be

314
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:07,840
lower as in this graph but there is some

315
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,630
degree of over fitting for our

316
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,670
convolutional neural networks to

317
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,500
specific screen because it's screens do

318
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,260
have screen specific traits and their

319
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,230
audio signals so to eliminate this

320
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,880
overfitting what we did was we evaluated

321
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,750
the methodology of just training with

322
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,540
more screens and we did a pretty

323
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,210
extensive evaluation here took recorded

324
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,480
with 10 screens and took a bunch of like

325
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:37,010
informative subsets of them and we found

326
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,140
that the trend is that when you train

327
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:43,130
with more screens it does eliminate the

328
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:45,439
overfitting and if you train with a lot

329
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,270
of screens you might get accuracy that's

330
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,050
comparable to training and testing on

331
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:53,270
the same screen this has been our talk

332
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,930
too just to conclude microphones are

333
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:59,660
everywhere audio is is very available

334
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,689
and it might convey on-screen content

335
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,959
and so the thousand words in our paper

336
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,110
are worth the picture on the screen and

337
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,110
that's it

338
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,400
[Applause]

339
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,140
thank you so we have time for questions

340
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,340
I guess the obvious question is to ask

341
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:24,460
what your co-authors were doing during

342
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,900
meetings well I'm so interesting that

343
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,360
they were definitely listening to me I'm

344
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:34,930
very good very good okay yeah yes I

345
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,580
think hey guys first thanks hey been

346
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,810
transferred that was really cool

347
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,280
do you think you'd ever be able to

348
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,280
reconstruct a screen image

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,530
well our results are currently that you

350
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,730
can extract text is the most fine-grain

351
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:55,560
thing we can do we could we could do

352
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:58,120
it's a topic for future work

353
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,300
look desert house from samsung research

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,650
america i'm this might be in the paper

355
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,800
already i haven't had a chance like the

356
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,319
whole thing but do you have any insight

357
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,550
into as screen technology develops in

358
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,620
the trends that it seems to be going

359
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,780
larger screens are jura solutions

360
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,670
thinner displays do you think they'll

361
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,439
become more susceptible to this attack

362
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,130
or less susceptible that's a good

363
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:26,620
question so all I can say is we tested

364
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:28,570
the screens we tested were both old and

365
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,110
very new so we tested the screens from

366
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,380
2013 and screens from 2017 and we did

367
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:38,560
not notice any deterioration and the

368
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,910
signal we what we saw was that they leak

369
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,060
in the same way in the sense that we

370
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:49,079
could see zebras on the on the Indy

371
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,079
audio signal so that's what I can offer

372
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,530
is there a benefit of using multiple

373
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,930
microphones on the same screen we did

374
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,880
not try why would you use multiple

375
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:06,129
microphones so you get maybe you can

376
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,990
reduce the noise in some traces I don't

377
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,040
know it's the question I'm not sure I'm

378
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,620
not sure the there are specific

379
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,440
locations on the screen that are that

380
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:20,979
leak you know that were the signal is

381
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,520
stronger i but I don't think the single

382
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,050
is diff

383
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,709
from different locations on the screen

384
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:39,520
so I'm not sure recording with two

385
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:42,970
microphones would yeah thanks hi this is

386
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,730
singer paese from UC irvine great talk I

387
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,770
had a question do you have any

388
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:52,840
countermeasures for this attack do you

389
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:55,600
have anything so since since I'll like

390
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,899
it affects so many screens that are

391
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,870
already there and it's a physical trade

392
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:05,170
of the screen you would have to change

393
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,939
to modify the way that you build screens

394
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:10,750
and you have to add other either

395
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:15,430
shielding or more noise to to eliminate

396
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:18,030
the signal and so yeah that those would

397
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:20,230
be the types of mitigations and I don't

398
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,030
we currently don't see screen

399
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,290
manufacturers rushing to adopt these

400
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,930
medications we have similar works it's

401
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,450
on a different machine but we try to

402
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:35,200
update the software so when you are

403
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,900
consuming power it is just something

404
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,840
that's always the same and you don't see

405
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:44,170
the noise on the system right so here

406
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:49,120
you would have to there are defenses

407
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:51,580
against Vanek leakage that make that

408
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:58,209
change the font a little bit so that

409
00:18:51,580 --> 00:19:01,389
it's the I guess at least in the level

410
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,820
of a screen line of a pixel line it

411
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,470
remains consistent you could do that

412
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,629
with the software yeah with with

413
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,190
sensitive software you could do that

414
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,700
yeah we have more details about that in

415
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:16,350
the paper

416
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:19,360
thank you okay one more quick question

417
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:22,120
hi this is a Coon's a dream from HKUST

418
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,949
so why you do the website fingerprinting

419
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,949
I just wonder how do you collect the

420
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,840
data how do you train you train on the

421
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,190
same data and taste on the same web

422
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,580
pages and

423
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:40,580
does the loading time of a web page

424
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:43,879
affect your accuracy we wait we waited

425
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,649
until the okay not exactly sure but I

426
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,480
think we wait until the page got loaded

427
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,400
using the selenium API for that but we

428
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,559
also waited a few seconds after so that

429
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,929
the page was loaded and we didn't scroll

430
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,780
through the page but there were a lot of

431
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:07,100
websites with dynamic content and just

432
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:12,500
that's we because we took the 100 most

433
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:14,980
popular websites so and yes the the for

434
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:22,419
the first question the training and test

435
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:25,429
sets of websites were the same yes but

436
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:30,919
the victim could visit any other web

437
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:33,409
pages in reality and also I think how do

438
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,500
you know the loading time of the web

439
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:39,770
page how do you knows the end and the

440
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:43,070
start of the web page at all so that's

441
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,840
true for an accoustic adversary that can

442
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,549
listen to what the victim is doing they

443
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,870
might be able to tell you know according

444
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:51,250
to clicks when they're loading a web

445
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,510
page and when it's done plausibly and

446
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,940
definitely there are other websites so

447
00:20:53,510 --> 00:21:00,320
the top 100 websites is not enough but

448
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:02,270
it's a lot and it shows how you know

449
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,939
that very powerful distinguishing

450
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,190
capability the adversary that tries to

451
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,370
tell whether or not you're doing one

452
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:14,780
activity or a bunch of other activities

453
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,699
is more is a more plausible adversary

454
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,309
yeah

455
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,490
rest offline and let's thank speaker

456
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,490
again

457
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,120
you
