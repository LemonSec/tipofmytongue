1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,610
okay thanks for the introduction

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm Dee from the Chinese University of

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,279
Hong Kong I would like to introduce our

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,009
work on real-world other bursary images

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,820
for illicit promotion this is a joint

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,950
work with Indiana University Chinese

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,090
University of Hong Kong and the Chinese

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:36,450
Academy of Sciences okay

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:39,810
first let me look into real example when

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,120
we processing the online forum we

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,559
usually encounter some in proprietary

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:51,959
mijung and on them there are promotional

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:54,718
content tracing these promotional

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,429
content we will follow a long

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,620
redirection chain and at the end we will

16
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,760
enter a website showing the sexual

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,658
stream the stranger things that these

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,380
foreign has protected by his account and

19
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,400
the detectors why this improper images

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:21,869
still survive if they do to the wrong

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,530
detectors have been deployed our answer

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:28,920
is negative we have paid these improper

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,780
images or other state-of-the-art illicit

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,620
count and attackers but we have found

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:42,840
that these images can pass them all

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:47,420
which motivates our to do further

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,420
investigate on these impropriety images

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,789
that some instance of them here we take

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,490
panda at this altitude for alleged

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,490
accountant sorry - a panda

31
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,008
we named this improper images with

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:15,640
promotional content and can pass current

33
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:18,250
detectors as at least a pasar different

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,920
from the other virtual examples defined

35
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:25,019
in adverts or internally other words

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:28,510
examples such images with small noise

37
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,120
can hardly be to be distinguished from

38
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,870
the original images and will cause miss

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,019
clarification and APIs are not the crop

40
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,450
the images copy images are such piece

41
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:47,400
wising no insane meaningless images a

42
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,399
face seemed like or can't be too dim to

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:58,360
specifically appease have promotional

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:03:01,530
information maybe with noise maybe

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,019
overlaid by sound chips or boxes and

46
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:10,239
they may be transformed into some other

47
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:14,560
shapes in general we conclude to common

48
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:20,799
captures most of a preset first they

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:23,380
have promotion content in a second there

50
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:30,489
is at least one region of explicit

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:33,549
content is clear to cache human eyes so

52
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,299
according to the two captors we desire a

53
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:40,079
new matter to detect them calm and Nina

54
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:45,359
Molina contains exocrine shall fall

55
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:45,359
components preprocessor

56
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:57,179
promotional encounter identifier we do

57
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,269
not elicit the content detector and a

58
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,120
reason is checker if an image it pass

59
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,120
them all we recognize it as an athlete

60
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:11,250
literally the preprocessor tried to

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,739
identify the mg type and expanded gif

62
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:18,899
fell into separate pictures and the

63
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,988
promotion accountant identify try to

64
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,760
find promotional content here the

65
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,210
promotion accountant can be roughly

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:31,800
calculated into two types tags and QR

67
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:34,830
code to find tags is straightforward we

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,729
just use an exact insurer named pixel

69
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:42,000
ink that you find clogged hole is a

70
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,210
little challenge as clear code may in

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,710
different cells and most of a current

72
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,239
detectors where to find them all except

73
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,138
one

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:05:00,210
embedded inch which had the popular on

75
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:05,070
iPad application and it because at axle

76
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:06,989
want to users can't their code by using

77
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,409
the reach head so they can view the

78
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,530
close connection with them but there's a

79
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,690
problem which hell is so heavy to

80
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:21,179
imported in our matter does we use

81
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:24,150
another approach the office to begin we

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,910
feel to the QR code by a map or

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,820
threshold and to the detection on these

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:35,070
filtered images this simple manner works

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:40,610
we are on our attractive images to find

86
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:43,699
the explicit content for an input images

87
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:48,330
we first use a proposal network to

88
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:50,960
propose regions contain human and we

89
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:55,469
keep those regions with high

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:59,909
confidential school of that we cut them

91
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:01,080
off and wrong and your network to check

92
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:06,090
whether they

93
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:10,969
explicit that's a component is the

94
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:14,609
invasiveness checker is as simple as to

95
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,490
use current to use current detector to

96
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,860
check the raster images whether they can

97
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:26,669
pay them their detections okay

98
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:31,080
Maria works well on our data says he'd

99
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:36,180
achieved 91% a precision and the 85% I

100
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,719
recall using Bernina we have found more

101
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,180
than 4,000 satis that had been manually

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,110
confirmed from the total data set it

103
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,169
contains four million images of 76,000

104
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,610
post from the top two Chinese social

105
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:57,930
networks teba and back and we pour the

106
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:01,319
two networks so huge they taper contain

107
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,500
more than 200 million users and Weibo

108
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,849
content more than 400 million users and

109
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,270
our data collection is even which means

110
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:16,529
we have found a piece in those posts

111
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:22,740
relevant to the concept say the posted

112
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:25,830
may talking about a policy so we want to

113
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,370
what we try to understand it behind the

114
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,969
behind ecosystem subsequently we try to

115
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:36,080
understand three questions first what

116
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:38,849
are the visual pattern of these APIs

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:45,870
second what are the promotion counting

118
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:48,210
on them and how are they distributed for

119
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:57,740
visual pattern we conclude seven common

120
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:57,739
method applied on them noise

121
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:16,990
blur noise texture generalization a

122
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:21,220
collusion rotation and a color

123
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:27,400
manipulation most of APIs are based on

124
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:33,330
this method all their combinations from

125
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,329
our statistics we found that moisten

126
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:46,090
rotation occlusion at the top three

127
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:48,910
popular matters to further investigate

128
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:53,340
the fact of these methods we tested two

129
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:56,560
famous detectors from Google and Yahoo

130
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,850
foundries with all we found that if we

131
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,579
rotate the explicit images by 45 or 135

132
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:13,120
degrees the two detectors lose their

133
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:16,240
effectiveness or we add some noise on

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,360
the experience images even those not

135
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,400
even this noise is not so severe these

136
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,770
true detectors also lose their

137
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:29,490
effectiveness as for the color

138
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:34,150
manipulation we found that if we

139
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:36,310
transform explicit images in green the

140
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:39,300
two detectors lose their efficacy the

141
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,300
effectiveness or gain

142
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,769
after starting the new visual pattern of

143
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,319
a piece we measured the promotion

144
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,449
countin on them as mentioned before

145
00:09:51,319 --> 00:10:01,819
promote accountant can be calculated

146
00:09:53,449 --> 00:10:05,269
into two tabs tax and QR code from the

147
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:08,240
result we found that which had a D is

148
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:16,670
the most popular promotion content

149
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:19,990
Advisory pays all a breeze here is the

150
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,120
interesting let's look at these pictures

151
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,519
adversary's may use secret signal to

152
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,910
cover the real meanings of promotion

153
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:37,399
countenance for instance adversely may

154
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:41,060
use VX to represent a beachhead from

155
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,670
another angle different crack code and

156
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,508
the URL may point to the same

157
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,449
destination and the same explicit

158
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:53,180
content may reuse the two different

159
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:58,128
promotional goals these reviews

160
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:00,920
phenomena is very common 37 percentage

161
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:05,379
of promotion accountant shall on more

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,790
than one APIs and net one percentage of

163
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:13,629
app has showed their experience

164
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:17,990
accountants to others by grouping those

165
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:20,689
apples showing explicit or promotion

166
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,139
accountant we recovered they are behind

167
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:27,439
the campaign's he released top five

168
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:30,620
campaigns to be noted noted that the

169
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:37,389
number one campaigns have posted more

170
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,389
than 113 thousands post 13,000 Aries

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,350
next week we study the distribution

172
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:57,050
channels we measure the account

173
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,130
controlled by these campaigns and this

174
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:04,699
account can be divided into two types

175
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:07,970
the compromised accounts and dedicated

176
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:12,230
account those who compromised account

177
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:14,000
post app is only on hot rocks and they

178
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,960
may be compromised by other bursaries

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,090
that Acadie accounts they are very

180
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:27,770
aggressive they post app is more than 30

181
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:30,610
pose a day even in those hosts the

182
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,610
sentences are meaningless

183
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,330
so we curious about that this account is

184
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:44,390
controlled by its maintained by rope

185
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:47,540
robot we measure this account and we

186
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,010
found that campaigns account sure more

187
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,250
than dedicated counted in the

188
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,840
compromised account and the moding half

189
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,840
of accounts are the dedicated

190
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:06,370
okay above according about three

191
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:11,199
measurement we also concluded three

192
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:14,769
suggestions for visual pattern we said

193
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:17,559
that we can heart and current models by

194
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:20,050
fine-tuning them on the augmenting

195
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:24,579
dataset containing images with such

196
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:27,008
visual patterns and for the promotion

197
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:29,199
content is to a data we can recognize

198
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:32,529
promotional channel linking to the

199
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,829
outside and which can create are to

200
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:37,480
increase the power of promotion

201
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:43,899
distributing promotion distributing at

202
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:46,720
ease and for the disputing channel we

203
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:49,420
suggest that add more rules to constrain

204
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:56,670
behave account behaviors can mitigate

205
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:59,490
those dedicated counts okay well our

206
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:03,899
tech weights are very bold first

207
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:06,699
athletes are prevalent second

208
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:11,290
understanding the behind ecosystem is

209
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:15,939
important for defeating abuse for

210
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:21,519
example we can do the defense based on

211
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:26,949
the this all block third professional

212
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:32,199
channel of APIs and third hardening

213
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:46,508
current models is urgently needed thank

214
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:48,339
you any questions hi I really enjoyed

215
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,050
the talk I have a lot of respect for you

216
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,639
guys are doing trying to clean a lot of

217
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,209
this stuff up what's your name and

218
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,579
affiliation

219
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:59,170
sure Luke desert ELLs Samsung Research

220
00:14:54,579 --> 00:15:01,689
America my question is do you have

221
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,610
advice for other researchers who will

222
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:06,790
have to deal with extremely sensitive

223
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,209
data for example what were your

224
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,490
responsibilities if you actually found

225
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,270
something extremely illicit to the point

226
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,470
where lon

227
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,069
forcement would be very interested in

228
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,570
finding out I won't give specific

229
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,550
examples but I'm sure you can imagine

230
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,710
there there are some things that are

231
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,410
much more illicit than others some are

232
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,700
annoying and then others are

233
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,300
representative of just horrible crimes

234
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,800
that that need to be I don't know I'd

235
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,459
feel that even holding it in a data

236
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,310
repository for the research sorry you

237
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:44,170
onto a skedaddle by the weekend we would

238
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:46,329
publish our data no no no okay I'll be

239
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,610
more specific with the risk of being

240
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,340
politically incorrect let's say you've

241
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,650
you found all these appease and if you

242
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,360
found one with child pornography in it

243
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,600
what do you do about that

244
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,240
what would another researcher what is

245
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,590
there any guideline or existing set of

246
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,880
principles to follow when dealing with

247
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,780
this kind of data okay so you want ask

248
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,390
research as in about the following

249
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:16,120
research sure let's say in your case was

250
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,340
there like an IRB or any any sort of

251
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,670
board that said here's what you do if

252
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,350
you find this type of data like

253
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:31,120
something like child pornography for

254
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:39,460
example mm-hmm so I would say amounts to

255
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:42,970
ending so we found these APIs actually

256
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:47,550
we are not so comfortable to see them on

257
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:51,520
the internet even we are adults so we

258
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:54,219
also try that we can harden the current

259
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,540
a new network chief - let them be

260
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:03,100
stronger to defeat or to detect them all

261
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:06,730
so we can have a clear phenomenon say in

262
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,709
the website I think the two of you

263
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:17,310
should also discuss offline yeah I think

264
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:20,290
okay so work is follows by our

265
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,720
Institute's I happy and we also report

266
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,959
our results to the

267
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,019
corresponding platform and also if you

268
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:33,009
found some a child related a point image

269
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:40,539
is responsible to by law to report to

270
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:42,000
police regular station okay thank you

271
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:47,019
very much for answering the question

272
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,779
thanks hello Tom Benjamin perspective

273
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:52,509
labs quick question about the difficulty

274
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:53,559
of finding the QR codes you are

275
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,649
mentioning that there was some

276
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,740
difficulty with that QR codes the point

277
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:01,209
of it usually is that somebody can scan

278
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,529
it and it will take them somewhere that

279
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:09,460
the QR code will be recognized so why

280
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:11,529
were these obscured and if they were

281
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,019
hard to detect was there still utility

282
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:17,379
could people use the QR code actually

283
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:20,080
that the code we actually think that

284
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:22,539
code and finally calculate is simple as

285
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,820
you find in the text but we test the

286
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,980
most of currently tax rate they cannot

287
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,129
find them all except the one in the

288
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,850
beach hat we think that is because taxes

289
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:36,340
won't to users can these you are called

290
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:39,250
only batteries chair so they can build a

291
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:43,418
close connection between them so this

292
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:46,600
piece is the real case so we have not a

293
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:48,879
further study on why this QR code cannot

294
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,500
be detected by Colonel detectors so

295
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:53,740
maybe this is a further daddy thank you

296
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,529
awesome

297
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:00,230
any other questions then let's say thank

298
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:05,779
you

299
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,779
[Applause]
