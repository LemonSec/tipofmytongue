1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,580
good

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,970
what is a consensus protocol in the

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,250
blockchain world a consensus protocol

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,110
prescribes whom to believe when people

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,740
have different opinions in transaction

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,500
history improve of work consensus

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,980
protocols the authentic history is

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,940
defined as the version that is most

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,620
computationally challenging to produce

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,660
many proof-of-work protocols have been

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,449
proposed after bitcoins Nakamoto

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,949
consensus each claims to achieve

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,300
stronger security properties than NC

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,190
however the technological progress

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,000
cannot be measured by the number of

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,470
protocols the key question is is there a

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,720
proof of work for the coal that

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,750
comprehensively outperforms and see

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:06,400
insecurity let's first recall and see

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,799
the protocol prescribed to resolve force

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,680
miners might on the longest chain if

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,150
there is one or the first receive chain

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,189
in time to issue rewards the protocol

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,350
prescribes maintain blocks received for

25
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,469
rewards and orphan blocks received

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,530
nothing the key weakness of the protocol

27
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:28,928
is its imperfect chain quality which

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,270
means an attacker with less than 50% of

29
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:33,600
mining power can modify the block chain

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,130
with high success rate

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,729
consequently three attacks are made

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:43,240
possible first selfish mining in this

33
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,429
figure the double red line indicates the

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,530
public network and the red square

35
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,590
indicates when a block is broadcast to

36
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,569
the network when the attacker finds a

37
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,259
block instead of publishing it to the

38
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:58,090
network he secretly withhold it hoping

39
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,670
to gain a larger lead on the public

40
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,740
chain if the next block is fined by an

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,439
honest miner the attacker broadcast the

42
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,298
block to the public hoping that the next

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,600
block will be fined after the attacker

44
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,990
block if the attacker is lucky enough to

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,030
find more than one block in a row he

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,520
will not broke us the chain until the

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,319
leader is reduced to one at that time

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,720
the attacker book has all the secret

49
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,540
blocks because the attacker chain is

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,960
longer all miners will mind on the

51
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,929
attacker

52
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:33,850
Chane in this attack the attacker gains

53
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,450
unfair block reverse block reverse

54
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,910
unproportional to its mining power share

55
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,339
what is worse honest miners are rational

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,740
miners would be incentivized to join

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,660
force the attacker because the relative

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,030
block reward increases super linnaeus

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,299
lee super linearly with the mining power

60
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,000
share which damages decentralization the

61
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,190
second attack is called double spending

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,470
the attacker in the attacker signs a

63
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,100
transaction to a merchant and embedded

64
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,359
in the public chain well secretly put a

65
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,150
conflicting version of the transaction

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,160
in its secret chain when the public

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,830
chain which is six confirmation the

68
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,170
merchant would deliver the product at

69
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,720
that time the attacker release all the

70
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,709
secret blocks to invalidate the honest

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,390
chain in this attack the attacker gets

72
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,920
the product without paying for it the

73
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,500
third attack is called censorship attack

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,589
or feather foking attack the attacker

75
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,420
publicly claims to invalidate all the

76
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,660
blocks confirming certain transactions

77
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,750
if some miners does not obey the order

78
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,240
the attacker will try to invalidate the

79
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,130
miners block in despite that the

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,200
attacker may temporarily in the shorter

81
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,000
chain

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,190
although the success rate of this attack

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,200
is slim the rational choice for other

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,450
miners is to join the attacker in the

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,810
censorship attack to avoid losing block

86
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,609
rewards there are other attacks but they

87
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,850
do not target the consensus layer

88
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,880
directly our evaluation framework

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,680
consists of four metrics recall that the

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,859
imperfect chain quality leads to three

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,650
attacks so a protocol claims to be more

92
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,620
secure than and C needs to be easier to

93
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,420
achieve spider chain quality or resist

94
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,820
better against all three attacks

95
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,830
so which mining resistance is measured

96
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,300
by incentive compatibility double

97
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,919
spanning resistance is measured by

98
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,590
subversion gain and censorship

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,590
resistance is measured by censorship so

100
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,799
set but susceptibility please check the

101
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,570
paper for the mathematical definitions

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,550
here are the better better than and C

103
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,770
candidates we split them into

104
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,170
two groups the first group is called

105
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,060
banner Chang quality protocols these

106
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,650
protocols claim that I can raise the

107
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,560
Chang quality and solve the problem

108
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,289
fundamentally the second group is called

109
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,480
attack resistant protocols this

110
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,280
protocols claims that I do not need to

111
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,100
raise the chain quality I can defend

112
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,739
against all the attacks usually by a

113
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,680
normal block chain topology or an oval

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,520
reward distribution mechanism we further

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,830
we split this group into three subgroups

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,500
reward our protocols distribute rewards

117
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,539
to maintain blocks and orphan the orphan

118
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,340
blocks to remove the incentive for the

119
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,100
attacker to perform double spent Salvage

120
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,219
mining attack punishment protocols

121
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,480
forfeit rewards from other blocks

122
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,940
regardless of whether they are in the

123
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,070
main chain hoping that this can

124
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,550
discourage attackers from doing Salvage

125
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,340
mining and double spending attacks

126
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,140
reward lucky protocols distribute reward

127
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,969
according to the block content rather

128
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,740
than the block topology hoping that

129
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,630
certain blocks serves that serves as

130
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,670
anchor point to stabilize the block

131
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:51,310
chain our method is made based on Markov

132
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,820
decision process which is most commonly

133
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,100
used in analyzing a stated strategic

134
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,670
players behavior in a partly stochastic

135
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,040
environment the main idea is to model

136
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,650
the protocol execution as a Markov

137
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,720
decision process and compute the

138
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,390
attackers optimal strategy and its

139
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,820
relative and its security metric of

140
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:17,020
interest the first step is to define the

141
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
attackers utility according to the

142
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,400
security metric of interest for example

143
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,650
in selfish mining the attackers utility

144
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,890
is defined as the percentage of the

145
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,690
attackers reward among all the rewards

146
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:36,969
the second step is is to model the

147
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:38,680
protocol as an MDP and then we we solve

148
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:42,670
the MDP and compute the attackers

149
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,280
optimal strategies we compare the

150
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,860
utilities with an C and C find out

151
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,169
whether they are better or worse alas we

152
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,559
check the respective strategies and find

153
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:57,099
out why before we go to the ridge

154
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:58,479
a disclaimer do not equate the security

155
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,019
of a consensus protocol with these

156
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,878
cryptocurrencies as many real-world

157
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:06,429
factors affect the security of the

158
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,829
cryptocurrencies for example deploying a

159
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:11,138
51% percent attack against a theorem

160
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:15,369
classic is obviously easier than doing

161
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,979
that on Bitcoin and several system

162
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:20,379
implement a real-world implement

163
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:26,318
external protection for certain attack

164
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:28,389
resistance so here are the results as

165
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,369
you can see there is no protocol that

166
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,839
comprehensively outperforms nakamoto

167
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:34,059
consensus in security

168
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,969
they either only raised the chain

169
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:40,959
quality in certain attacker setting or

170
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:45,219
sacrifice one attacker incentive for the

171
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:48,179
other in the paper we identify several

172
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:52,119
protocol specific attack strategies and

173
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:54,369
enumerate and a series of insights on

174
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:56,649
why they fail to achieve their goals for

175
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:58,629
the rest of this presentation I will

176
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:02,409
introduce two examples and only one

177
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:05,009
insight the first example is called is

178
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:07,688
an reward or protocol called fruit chase

179
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,759
in fruit chains the same mining

180
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:13,179
procedure will produce two kinds of

181
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,819
different product it is a block if the

182
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:17,649
first K piece of the mining of the ovis

183
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:21,279
hash is lower than a certain threshold

184
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:24,069
it is a fruit if the last K piece of the

185
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:27,609
product has hash is below than another

186
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:29,529
threshold and fruits are embedded in

187
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:33,308
blocks and transactions are embedded in

188
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:35,639
fruits the for resolving policy follows

189
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:39,938
longest chain and first receive similar

190
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:43,120
semis Nakamoto consensus and each fruit

191
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:45,250
has a pointer block which the miner the

192
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,089
fruit miner is sure will not be orphaned

193
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:53,769
a fruit is valid if the pointer block is

194
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:56,559
in the main chain and the gap is below a

195
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,689
certain threshold the gap is defined as

196
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,839
the height difference between a fruits

197
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:04,959
host block and its winter block in this

198
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,829
example the winter block of tomato is

199
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,359
orphaned so tomato can never be

200
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:13,008
and on his fruit and because the pair is

201
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,610
not embedded in the blockchain soon

202
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,949
enough after it is mined it can never it

203
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:25,069
can never be a well at root because it's

204
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:27,589
gap is too large the reward distribution

205
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:29,738
policy is that Valley fruits receive

206
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,509
full rewards and blocks receive nothing

207
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:34,730
here are fruit chains results it is

208
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,589
actually worse than a Kabuto consensus

209
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,449
in incentive compatibility and

210
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:43,249
subversion game because risk free units

211
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:46,910
encourages encourage audacious behavior

212
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:50,779
what do I mean by risk free units in

213
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:53,089
fruit chains attackers blocks are risk

214
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,819
free units because they don't get any

215
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,429
reward anyway so for the attacker why

216
00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:00,589
not withholding them and the attackers

217
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,809
first several fruits are also risk free

218
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,929
units because they can be embedded in

219
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:08,209
both chains so the rewards are secured

220
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:10,689
so for the attacker why not try to

221
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:13,549
double spend or doing selfish mining

222
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:15,439
fruit chain Censorship susceptibility is

223
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:19,100
better than that of Nakamoto consensus

224
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:21,559
because fruits invalidated blocks can be

225
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:27,559
added back later in the blockchain in

226
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:29,868
this figure the orange is orphaned by

227
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,689
several attacker blocks but it is later

228
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:35,269
embedded in another block so the more

229
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:38,480
the orange miners still get some fruit

230
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,699
rewards the second example is a

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,709
punishment protocol called reward

232
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:48,139
splitting protocol it allows blocks to

233
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:51,739
refer to previously orphaned blocks as

234
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:54,169
uncle's an uncle is valid if the gap is

235
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,809
below a certain threshold the gap is

236
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:59,749
defined as the height difference between

237
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:02,719
the ankles the uncles host block and the

238
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:04,399
uncle itself note that this definition

239
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,739
is different from the gap definition of

240
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,139
fruit chains in Reverse splitting

241
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:12,220
protocol there is no pointer block we

242
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:15,470
don't care about kin relationship and

243
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,529
each block its block reward is split

244
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,860
evenly among all the blocks of the same

245
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,860
height

246
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:25,399
the incentive compatibility and

247
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,870
subversion gain of reverse deleting

248
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,810
protocol is better than Nakamoto

249
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,029
consensus because punishment is always

250
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,300
the most effective way to incentivize

251
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,310
correct behavior in fact three

252
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,139
confirmation reverse splitting protocol

253
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,050
performs better than nine confirmation

254
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:44,149
routines we also compute the subversion

255
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,609
bounty of different protocol which is

256
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,410
defined as the minimum double spending

257
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,610
reward to incentivize double spending

258
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:56,029
behavior when the attacker can chose 10%

259
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,889
of the mining power and each each

260
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,019
transaction requires six block

261
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:02,000
confirmation the subversion bounty in

262
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:07,490
the Kabuto consensus is a hundred and

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,589
two block reward it is 346 in Reverse

264
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,079
speeding protocol but zero in fruit

265
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:15,440
chase so in fruit chains it's always

266
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,209
free the censorship susceptibility of

267
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,810
reverse speeding is quite interesting

268
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:22,489
for weak attacker it is actually easier

269
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,670
for the attacker to perform censorship

270
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,920
attack because an attacker block mind

271
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,449
after the honest block can still split

272
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,569
some block rewards from the honest

273
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:34,670
miners so reward splitting actually

274
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:37,089
introduced a new tool for the attacker

275
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:42,949
to forfeit rewards from honest miners

276
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:44,480
but for strong attackers sometimes it is

277
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:46,939
actually stronger than Nakamoto

278
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,769
consensus because in the comodo

279
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,829
consensus if your orphan a certain

280
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:54,380
certain blocks then all the block

281
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:57,349
rewards are forfeited but in Reverse

282
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,660
splitting protocol may orphan the blocks

283
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:06,410
they may still split some rewards from

284
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:09,170
you wenching quality is not perfect we

285
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:12,829
have a dilemma dilemma if you reward all

286
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,800
the blocks then there's no risk to

287
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:17,719
double spend if you punish all

288
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,609
suspicious blocks you actually introduce

289
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,709
a new tool for the attacker to perform

290
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,990
censorship attack if you only reward

291
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,029
lucky protocols because lucky if you

292
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,190
only rule a key blocks because lucky

293
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,709
doesn't equal to good it actually leaves

294
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,339
larger room for management malicious

295
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:36,290
manipulation in sum we need to go beyond

296
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,740
reward distribution policies to solve a

297
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:43,339
policy to solve all the attacks so what

298
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,199
do we learn simplicity is beauty there

299
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,230
is no protocol that comprehensively

300
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,519
outperforms nakamoto consensus and there

301
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,069
are several things not to do when

302
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,870
designing consensus protocols the first

303
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:56,180
is to design a protocol too complicated

304
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,059
to analyze there are several protocols

305
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,769
they have no security analysis and their

306
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,800
vulnerabilities are only revealed by our

307
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:06,050
analysis the second is to analyze your

308
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,959
security against one attacker strategy

309
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,359
because your new protocol often inspires

310
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,959
the attacker to create new attack

311
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,790
strategy to attack your protocol the

312
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,518
third thing is to analyze your security

313
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,170
against one attacker incentive

314
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,329
optimizing your protocol against one at

315
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,128
a great incentive often makes it more

316
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,638
vulnerable to other attacker incentive

317
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:33,649
the last is to use unrealistic

318
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:36,829
parameters so how to achieve barraging

319
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:39,529
quality and attack resistance we suggest

320
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:42,529
you use more practical assumptions like

321
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:44,749
awareness of network conditions loosely

322
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:48,290
synchronize clocks or real world

323
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:50,689
commitment or ulcers liability to raise

324
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,719
attack resistance for example introduce

325
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:58,219
additional punishment rules or solve the

326
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,920
attack at layer two to conclude whenever

327
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,860
someone tells you he has a perfectly

328
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:09,219
secure consensus protocol you can tell

329
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,220
him academia is watching you thank you

330
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:17,550
[Applause]

331
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:25,190
thank you very much we have time for

332
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:25,189
questions yes

333
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,349
hi around thanks for the great talk so a

334
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,990
kind of practical question you said at

335
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,399
the end about people coming up with all

336
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,810
of these protocols and they're not being

337
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,670
measured against existing standards how

338
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:49,899
this is kind of like a more meta issue

339
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,878
but how do you have thoughts on how we

340
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,970
process through all of the different

341
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:58,600
protocols that people come up with and

342
00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:01,480
as a community we sort through protocols

343
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:08,110
to distinguish the really bad stuff and

344
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:11,350
the stuff that might be okay so people

345
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:15,249
come up with a lot of protocols how do

346
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,410
we there's just so many blockchain

347
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:21,459
protocols in the space at present how do

348
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:24,519
we as a community separate the good

349
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:27,430
protocols from the bad ones just listen

350
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,559
to the academia but in terms of academia

351
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,589
how do we there's just so many protocols

352
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,889
coming how do we evaluate them one by

353
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:45,970
one okay there's no better way to do it

354
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:47,439
I think okay further questions Christina

355
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:52,300
needs or Tyrone Northeastern University

356
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:54,279
I like very much to see your conclusion

357
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,469
about paying attention to network

358
00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:02,230
assumptions can you give us some

359
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:05,770
examples some examples on how to raise

360
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,390
attack resistance yes it seemed like the

361
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,480
assumptions that these block chains are

362
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:13,059
making about network conditions are very

363
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,970
weak yeah maybe I can strengthen them

364
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,918
using - local information for example if

365
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,350
I'm a miner when I received two

366
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,390
conflicting block at the same time I

367
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:25,480
would rather pay for the block with

368
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,840
whose timestamp is closer to mine in

369
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,360
terms of for resolving policy maybe this

370
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:35,820
kind of behavior can give us better

371
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,820
chain quality guarantee thank you

372
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:45,180
maybe one more question no question okay

373
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:48,460
then that's thing oh this one

374
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,970
so you measured these protocols against

375
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,520
three separate attacks and what's coming

376
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,260
to my mind is how well I mean it

377
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,570
obviously these are attacks that exist

378
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,870
in the wild and or have been analyzed

379
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,429
before but how do you know if there may

380
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,350
be further attacks that you may have to

381
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,360
analyze these protocols against and

382
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,980
especially if they change the core

383
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,439
consensus maybe more attacks become

384
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,960
feasible against them that is possible

385
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,880
so this is not a complete list this is

386
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,880
just the current attacks we're aware of

387
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:25,350
okay thank you so thank you very much

388
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,149
