1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,430
thank you for this introduction

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,530
I'm David repressed and this is joint

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,590
work with Katerina calls to Austin halls

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,630
and Christina pepper so um the first

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:24,520
three hours are from Roy University go

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,520
home and Christina is from NYU Abu Dhabi

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:33,050
so yeah it's about LTE and we use LTE on

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:36,800
a daily basis so it is expected that we

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,129
have of the world population 75% are

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,578
using early LTE in 2020 on a daily basis

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,800
and we use it for various scenarios for

12
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,710
sharing with our friends or they are

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,089
forming with our parents so we need to

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,190
secure the communication in particular

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:59,089
the radio communication between your

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:01:01,608
phone and the network so LTE has some

17
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:03,440
standard security aims like mutual

18
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,500
authentication between your phone and

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,810
the network traffic confidentiality that

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,050
secures the connection or does

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:16,460
encryption and some special aims like

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:19,009
identity and location confidentiality to

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,440
reach the security Ames we have first

24
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,240
initial authentication and key agreement

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,399
protocol that establish mutual

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,610
authentication before between your phone

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,950
and the network and also common key this

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,060
common key is used for ongoing security

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,620
measures and and secure the connection

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,890
we want to look have have a closer look

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,990
today at what kind of security is

32
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,270
implemented in the security connections

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,490
in particular where is this implemented

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,970
and what kind of security measures are

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:53,210
implemented and this brings me to the

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,280
layer 2 of LTE and this is a data link

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,020
layer and here are the security

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,110
implemented for the radio layer

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,840
connection impact in particular the PDC

40
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,780
P sub protocol implements the security

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,580
here we need to know that there's no

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,009
security measures below this layer and

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,290
we want to know what kind of security

44
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:17,480
measures are implemented at the P DCP

45
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,510
first we need to separate our data in

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,859
two kind of planes so we have a control

47
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,940
plane this is

48
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,460
LTE specific traffic

49
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,530
like when we hand over from one cell to

50
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,690
another this is done by the control

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,200
plane and we have user plane traffic

52
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,359
that is basically your raw IP data when

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,660
we went want to access a website or do

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,200
some TV streaming so on both planes we

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,600
have encryption and we have integrity

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,549
protection only on the control plane and

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,010
not on the user plane so today I want to

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,830
talk about three major attacks that

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,929
happen can happen on layer 2 first of

60
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,140
all of all I want to do an identity

61
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,690
mapping attack which allows us to use a

62
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,950
public identifier and map it down to the

63
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,540
radio identity we have metadata data on

64
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,119
layer 2 that allows website

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,920
fingerprinting and and we want to I want

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,290
to introduce the outer attack which

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,839
allows us to redirect the victim to a

68
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,140
malicious website due to missing

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,420
integrity protection so first I want to

70
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,299
start with an identity mapping this

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,690
allows us to use a public identity to

72
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,050
map down to the radio identity so we

73
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,600
have certain different identities in LTE

74
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,720
first we have the public identity of the

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,680
victim for example the free phones phone

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,890
number of your friend

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,290
and it's basically lifelong you might

78
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,260
change it but you will at least give

79
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,870
your friends your no new phone number so

80
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,810
and it's basically on layer 8 so we can

81
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,950
identify each other from Yui which is

82
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,780
the phone and LTE to Yui then we have

83
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,540
the permanent identity which which is

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,550
called MZ and this is only private

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,670
between your phone and the core network

86
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:18,090
so there should be no I take available

87
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:20,010
of this MZ we have also some for privacy

88
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,239
reasons we have also already some

89
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,950
temporary identity called timsy and

90
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,900
related work has already shown that we

91
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,680
can basically map the phone number of

92
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:35,270
the ue to the MZ and even down to the

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,460
temporary identity we have a search or

94
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,820
yeah

95
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,280
short LTE specific identity which is a

96
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:47,110
radio identity this is called Aaron TI

97
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,419
and this is only active during active

98
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,850
radio connection so only when you sang

99
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,460
active data to the radio connection the

100
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:58,600
aren TI is used and associated with your

101
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:01,450
phone and the data so as I said earlier

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,310
we have already seen some related work

103
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,820
where we can map the phone number to the

104
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,500
MZ and map the phone number to the Tim Z

105
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,540
what we want to show you today is how to

106
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,530
map the Tim Z to the aren TI

107
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,230
which is used on layer 2 and the idea is

108
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,179
quite simple so when our phone wants to

109
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,720
connect to a phone it initiate a radio

110
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,480
connection the email B or with the base

111
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,230
station of the network assigns us or the

112
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,540
phone and aren TI to be precise this is

113
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,950
called ciarán TI which is used only for

114
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:38,590
this radio connection to let the user or

115
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,930
the network know who we actually are we

116
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,409
use the Tim Z and we can now use an

117
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,930
uplink sniffer on this message to link

118
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,150
the AC aren TI with so Tim Z however

119
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,520
uplink sniffing is LT in LTE is

120
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,219
difficult which I would say it's not

121
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,039
impossible but you really need a good

122
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,950
hardware equipment to do synchronization

123
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,730
on the radio layer and in particular the

124
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,580
timing advance is quite difficult here

125
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,260
however there is one specification

126
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,830
problem I would say that allows us to

127
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:14,020
use also a downing sniffer because the e

128
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,969
note B sends back the Tim Z for

129
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,880
collision avoidance during the first

130
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:23,770
phase of this thing so we did this and

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,020
in a commercial network and we see this

132
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,990
is actually possible I want now to

133
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,030
present you the website fingerprinting

134
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,670
attack so once we have learned this year

135
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,280
and Ti of the user we can do website

136
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,470
fingerprinting wizard the idea is quite

137
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,270
simple and we know web site

138
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,900
fingerprinting from other contexts this

139
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,810
like tor or https website fingerprinting

140
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,370
and we can do it on encrypted traffic

141
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,330
however is it's new to the context of

142
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,360
LTE

143
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,280
and we can do it because there is

144
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,990
unencrypted layer to metadata available

145
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,299
in an LTE so the thing is quite easy so

146
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,610
we have a training set where we can run

147
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,590
or pre-record data of visiting website

148
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,629
and then we have an attack phase where

149
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,758
we record actually the user traffic and

150
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,889
then map both together so we have a

151
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,689
classification attack and when we get

152
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:17,949
the side correctly is that attack was

153
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:19,659
successful so we did this in our work

154
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,629
right now as the first proof runs a

155
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:25,090
proof of concept work in a controlled

156
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,159
lab set up and with simple scenarios and

157
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,400
we got a success rate about ninety-five

158
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:32,770
percent and we got also some real-world

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,870
feasibility studies and on a follow-up

160
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,758
paper and where we did this in a

161
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,680
commercial network where we also look

162
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,560
into influencing factors like use

163
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,539
browser use space membership set so if

164
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,879
we use an iPhone or an Android device

165
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:49,509
and how we compare these both together

166
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,490
and I refer here to the paper lost

167
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:56,680
traffic it encryption presented last

168
00:07:51,490 --> 00:08:00,219
week at Weissach so I want to not now

169
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,069
talk about the alter attack so and this

170
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:04,990
is an active attack so both before once

171
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,509
we were Pacific text and this is a

172
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,789
passive active attack on layer 2 and

173
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,949
which allows us to redirect the victim

174
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:15,878
to the to a malicious web site for

175
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:17,919
example we have three components of this

176
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,379
attack first of all we can modify the

177
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,479
plaintext the man-in-the-middle attack

178
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,729
is what we are kind of using as an

179
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,460
active attacker and this in the scenario

180
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,550
and one example of this is DNS spoofing

181
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,299
and I want to first introduce you the

182
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,698
plain text modification in LTE as I said

183
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,828
earlier there is no integrity protection

184
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:41,228
to the user plain and this happens on

185
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,779
the PD CP layer however the traffic is

186
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,300
encrypted so we want to now look how the

187
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:50,380
traffic is actually encrypted in LTE in

188
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:54,250
particular for the user plain we need to

189
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:57,189
know that the PDC P protocol encrypts

190
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,190
the whole IP packet so there is no IP

191
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,790
header left that can be used for at the

192
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,840
attacker side

193
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,030
and we use a stream cipher mainly in the

194
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,420
main yeah in commercial networks this is

195
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:14,720
often AAS encounter mode to do a simple

196
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,790
stream stream cipher where we XOR the

197
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,700
key stream with the plaintext and get

198
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:22,730
the cipher text out of it the sender

199
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,240
sends now this cipher text and this

200
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,550
might intercept it by an active attacker

201
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,220
the active attacker can now and modify

202
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,880
the cypher text by simply ignoring some

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,550
mask on it and for what the manipulated

204
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,890
cipher text to the receiver the receiver

205
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:45,140
has no means to control any on any

206
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,439
modification of the cipher text and also

207
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:51,830
decrypt sit with the same exact same key

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,690
stream as the sender did so we got the

209
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,160
manipulated plaintext that has the same

210
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,830
bit flips in the in the plaintext as

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,650
introduced by the attacker with the map

212
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,800
mask the interesting fact is that we can

213
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,199
now basically do known plaintext attack

214
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,979
where we can where we have temporary

215
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,380
text and data mystically get the

216
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,860
manipulated play text out of it by

217
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:27,920
simply ignoring the wanted plain text we

218
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:29,900
see want to see known plaintext I want

219
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,550
now to introduce the active

220
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,199
man-in-the-middle obviously we need an

221
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,839
active man in the middle to intercept

222
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,090
these messages and for LTE this was the

223
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,040
tricky part so I want to give you a

224
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,690
rough idea of the requirements and what

225
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,079
not to go into detail of the

226
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,700
implementation so first of all the

227
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,340
active man in the middle needs to act as

228
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,910
an e note B towards the victim towards

229
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,840
the phone

230
00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:00,680
and act as you eat so as phone to the

231
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:04,160
commercial network this all happens on

232
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,239
layer 2 and he needs to forward layer 2

233
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,240
frames on both sides

234
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,949
so we implemented such relay this is

235
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,300
open source LTE stack of software radio

236
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,829
system which is available on github and

237
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,199
this is actually how our experiment

238
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:27,569
looked like we put the Yui on a shilling

239
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:30,859
box to prevent enter any interference

240
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,720
with any outside commercial network and

241
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,980
we have a NOP component and the Yui

242
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,750
component using software-defined radios

243
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,910
the implemented this relay on a normal

244
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:48,540
computer running Linux

245
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,529
so as one example of manipulating the

246
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,579
ciphertext

247
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:57,000
we can perform DNS spoofing it in DNS

248
00:11:52,579 --> 00:12:00,209
spoofing attack the interesting fact on

249
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,870
DNS is that LTE the LTE network sets the

250
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:06,630
DNS request or the sets the DNS server

251
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,490
at the beginning of each connection so

252
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:14,360
an attacker can easily guess the plain

253
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:17,490
text of of the Steines requests further

254
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,730
DNS requests are easy identifiable by

255
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,339
its length so we can easily distinguish

256
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:27,569
between DNS request packets and normal

257
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:32,850
TCP traffic this is why we choose to use

258
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:34,620
DNS as one target I will roughly go

259
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,959
through the whole process the attack

260
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,959
procedure in particular we have on the

261
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,709
left side the victim to relay the

262
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:47,430
commercial Network and the internet here

263
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:49,829
so the you will connect to our relay so

264
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,359
we assume this but it has related work

265
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,010
has shown this as possible it's

266
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,910
basically a normal image capture attack

267
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:01,529
and performs and performs the attach

268
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:04,500
procedure attach procedure so the relay

269
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:08,939
forwards all messages including the aka

270
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,069
at this time both entities so the

271
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:17,250
commercial network MD UE our mutual

272
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:18,959
authentication on layer 3 and so there

273
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,060
is mutual authentication established

274
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,119
between both entities however the relay

275
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,280
4 what's all traffic on layer 2

276
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,500
so there will be one time there the Yui

277
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,540
will send in the rest request and the

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,150
relay will intercept this DNS request

279
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:38,410
based on a length it will exert the mask

280
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:42,520
and this right directs the IP packet to

281
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,650
the malicious DNS server the DNS server

282
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:49,569
the malicious DNS server will respond

283
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,930
with a DNS spoofing packet towards the

284
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,180
UE

285
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:56,410
however the relay will also intercept

286
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,680
this message and alter the source IP

287
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:03,100
address back to the original DNS

288
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,140
destination address because the UE needs

289
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,260
to match the outgoing packet into the

290
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:12,160
with the incoming packet all subsequent

291
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,920
messages so in particular the HTTP

292
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:21,219
connection is directed towards the HTTP

293
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:23,020
server under control of the attacker so

294
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,300
we have done this in a commercial

295
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,430
network using a commercial phone with a

296
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,890
commercial SIM card with the self built

297
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,439
relay and we were able basically to

298
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,900
redirect the victim which want to go to

299
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,160
a web site we use hotmail as one example

300
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,800
to a malicious - to normal website

301
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,319
redirected to a malicious web site where

302
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:51,520
we basically could could steal the

303
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:53,589
credentials the question is how we can

304
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,100
prevent this attack obviously with

305
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:59,830
integrity protection and in particular

306
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,700
on the user plain LTE is now fully

307
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:06,760
deployed fully specified and we all use

308
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,670
it so to be honest it will be unlikely

309
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,700
that there will any change on LTE

310
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:15,449
however 5g the upcoming promising new

311
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,930
radio technology and is still under

312
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:22,839
specification for certain parts and it

313
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:26,290
will be rolled all soon so there is

314
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,080
still optional integrity protection on

315
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,180
the user plain and only implementations

316
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,410
might have limited support of this an

317
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,250
integrity protection on the user plain

318
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,410
so there

319
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,120
attack vector remains open and current

320
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:45,760
and maybe also for future generations I

321
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,290
would come to now to my conclusion first

322
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,020
I've shown you an identity mapping

323
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,860
attack where we can match the public

324
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,870
identity to the radio identity website

325
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,490
fingerprinting was possible because we

326
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,470
have unencrypted metadata in LTE and

327
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,960
third I showed you the auto attack which

328
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,800
allows the redirection of user tool

329
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,260
malicious website I'm David repressed

330
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:19,719
from Rule University boham and I'm happy

331
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:21,010
to answer you any questions any

332
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,730
questions just please come to the

333
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,900
microphones in in the walkway I have the

334
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,440
pleasure of getting to ask the first

335
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,420
question so we've seen a few papers over

336
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,980
the course of this conference time over

337
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,189
looking at for instance like HTTPS

338
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:39,010
Everywhere at true end-to-end

339
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,690
authentication like does that factor in

340
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,430
at all in terms of defenses like why

341
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,860
wouldn't that have for instance you know

342
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,410
identified maybe the user any attack

343
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,500
that you had demonstrated so the

344
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,610
question is if there are upper layer and

345
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,650
countermeasures against it yeah

346
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,130
obviously there are for example you can

347
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:59,650
use HTTPS with secure cookie policy and

348
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,680
so on however we have I think we have

349
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:05,709
seen that also attacks on this layer can

350
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,329
happen so what my idea of a secure

351
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,910
communication system is that we have

352
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,089
from the ground on a secure connection

353
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,150
that one might one layer fail for

354
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:19,119
example LTE we have another layer of

355
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:21,520
protection against it so yeah that's why

356
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,780
we kind of request also integrity

357
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,579
protection needed in on the user playing

358
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,139
Tom Benjamin perspective let's I've got

359
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,940
a question about the number one there

360
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,970
the identity mapping could just hop back

361
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,920
in your slides I hope you know it's way

362
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,830
back in the slideshow but I was just

363
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:43,960
interested in the link between the TMS I

364
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:52,389
now and and the Rinty yeah I not have

365
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:56,080
been but you can so the question I was

366
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,880
gonna be asking is right there with well

367
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,860
okay so this is for the collision

368
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,980
avoidance but earlier were you saying

369
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,379
that you are at least for this way of

370
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,410
identifying the users Rinty you're

371
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,410
expecting that you know the TMS I yes

372
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:13,600
and so we are we are thinking about so

373
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,820
the attacker model is like and you know

374
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,310
the timsy from previous attacks and then

375
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,280
can link the timsy to to the RTI and

376
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,620
however we can also we saw some related

377
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,080
work that for example the timsy is not

378
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,928
really allocated in a random way and the

379
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,169
RTI is not allocated in a random way

380
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,990
like there's sub suite phone numbers and

381
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:37,540
so so the problem of fear is having not

382
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,000
randomized identities along with mapping

383
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,159
identities not in in a non-deterministic

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,420
way or in a deterministic way okay good

385
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,490
that was gonna be my question was

386
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,370
whether we were assuming that the TMS I

387
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,160
was not gonna have good randomness yes

388
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,149
so I see so we're saying that this is an

389
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,690
implementation problem rather than a

390
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,370
protocol problem yes I think it always

391
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,750
depends on implementation and

392
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,110
specifications so there is a

393
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,760
specification who says okay the Year MTI

394
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,459
the timsy needs to be randomized

395
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,670
sufficiently but but there's the guty

396
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,200
reallocation paper presented last or the

397
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,630
year before I don't know yeah that'll be

398
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,090
a question whether it is a specification

399
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,350
thank you you're welcome

400
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,060
all right let's thank our speaker once

401
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,219
more

402
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,409
