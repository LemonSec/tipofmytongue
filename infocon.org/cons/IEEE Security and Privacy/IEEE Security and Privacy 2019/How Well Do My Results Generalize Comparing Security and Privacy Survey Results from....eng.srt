1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,059
thanks guys for the introduction so

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,070
today I'd like to talk about the

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,070
generalizability of different samples

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,310
that we use in security surveys so in

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,380
the past about five years over 30 papers

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,229
in the top 4 security conferences have

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,680
used a survey in which users or

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,860
developers I responded to some human

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,449
written questions and over a hundred

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,699
security related papers have appeared in

11
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:40,180
other countries me in other conferences

12
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,680
also using survey measures and often a

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,630
question that we have about these

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,450
surveys we conduct is how generalizable

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,790
they are so when we go out and we

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,850
request responses are we really

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,610
representing say the opinions of the US

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,800
population or the opinions of some set

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,320
of developers and so in the talk today

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,660
we're going to explore how generalizable

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,989
of different surveys about security and

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,250
privacy are in the u.s. in particular

23
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,259
had to back up for a minute

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,869
we should talk about the ingredients of

25
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,340
surveys so when you're conducting a

26
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:14,470
survey you have some sort of research

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,910
questions you want to answer some set of

28
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,130
constructs that you're going to use to

29
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,810
answer those research questions and then

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,250
you're going to design a set of survey

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,459
questions in order to measure those

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,780
constructs so in a more traditional

33
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,759
measurement kind of style we would

34
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,250
identify some metrics and write some

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,539
code in order to record those metrics in

36
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,289
this case we're going to write some

37
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:37,810
words in order to measure these

38
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:40,300
constructs using survey questions after

39
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,429
we've asked our questions are written

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,590
our questions we're going to collect a

41
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:47,140
sample of responses to those questions

42
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,640
so we very rarely can ask all of the

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,039
people that we want to talk to so we

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,020
take a subset of them and finally we do

45
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,720
some statistical analysis to ultimately

46
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,069
answer our research questions and

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,440
today's talk is going to focus on the

48
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,929
sample portion if you're curious about

49
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,349
the questions portion we had some work

50
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:08,020
in CCS 2018 looking at the differences

51
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:11,500
between answers to surveys and log data

52
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,940
results okay so what are the types of

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,670
survey samples that are out there that

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,000
we could possibly use the most expensive

55
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,798
and typically kind of the gold standard

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,430
survey sample is a probabilistic survey

57
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,349
sample

58
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,650
these kind of surveys are conducted only

59
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,298
via telephone or on paper and the reason

60
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,340
for that is that you need to have a

61
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:33,349
sampling frame that gives you a

62
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,930
one-to-one matching between people in a

63
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,480
population like say the US and a

64
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,250
telephone number or mailing address so

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,069
you need to have a nonzero chance of

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,500
Meucci anyone in the population and in

67
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,988
the case of telephone surveys they'll

68
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,700
match them up with mailing address

69
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,250
samples they'll figure out who doesn't

70
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,929
have telephone access in a particular

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,459
demographic they'd like to sample and

72
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,230
they will actually go give those people

73
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,379
telephone access so they're reachable

74
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,819
for the serving what does the non zero

75
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,399
chance of reaching everyone in the

76
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,798
population allows you to do is it allows

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
you to do statistical weighting once you

78
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,879
actually get your responses back to

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,489
figure out how well you actually

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,189
captured all of the possible opinions in

81
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,200
a population so there's a quick example

82
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:20,269
of this kind of weighting if I have a

83
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,649
population of animals in the jungle

84
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,139
there's a thousand animals in the jungle

85
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,690
I'm going to throw an ice cream party

86
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,549
for the animals but I don't have time to

87
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,040
go survey every single animal about what

88
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:33,650
flavor of ice cream they want so I take

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,129
a random sample of a hundred animals in

90
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,280
the jungle and only forty of the Tigers

91
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:42,768
actually respond to my survey so there's

92
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,409
50% tigers in the whole population but

93
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,389
only 40% Tigers in my sample and

94
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,548
therefore since Tigers have different

95
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,349
preferences from the other animals if I

96
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,689
generalize just from the sample my

97
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,790
results are going to be a bit off so I

98
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,680
need to do some weighting and in order

99
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,620
to do that weighting I'm going to look

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,500
at the ratios of the Tigers in the whole

101
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,659
population to the ratio of tigers I got

102
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,000
in my sample and I'm going to wait up

103
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:11,149
the responses of the tigers in my sample

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,040
by 25% so I'm gonna say well instead of

105
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,780
actually meeting at 10

106
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,180
chocolate ice creams I need 12 and a

107
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,478
half chocolate ice creams and then times

108
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,550
10 in order to have an ice cream party

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,500
that meets everybody's requirements and

110
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,699
if I hadn't done this waiting I would

111
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,310
have reached a different conclusion

112
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,030
about the prevalence of tigers opinions

113
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,430
on ice cream

114
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,190
this is the same idea for probabilistic

115
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,590
surveys now these probabilistic surveys

116
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,450
are very very expensive

117
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,979
to conduct because you need a lot of

118
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,810
statisticians you need people to be

119
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,669
calling calling up folks on the

120
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,560
telephone or mailing out surveys so on

121
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,810
and so forth so we have other

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,419
alternatives there are nearly

123
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,430
probabilistic samples where you recruit

124
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,659
people to be part of a survey panel

125
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,060
where they're going to be asked to take

126
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,030
many surveys but they're recruited in a

127
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,970
probabilistic way we have census

128
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,979
representative nonprobability samples so

129
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,650
this is where people are asked to take

130
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:08,560
part in a survey panel through airline

131
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,780
frequent flyer programs Church charities

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,820
so on and so forth they get asked to do

133
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,549
a couple of surveys every month and they

134
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,469
get paid for doing so if you use one of

135
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,510
these panels you can get respondents

136
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,910
who's demographics that look like the US

137
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,650
population but you can't do this kind of

138
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,840
waiting because these participants

139
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,099
weren't randomly sampled and they're a

140
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,810
little bit different than your average

141
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,120
participant because they get surveyed a

142
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,860
lot then of course you have

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,830
crowd-sourced samples and this is what

144
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,320
the majority of surveys are that are in

145
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,659
the security community so crowd workers

146
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,330
do tasks for small amounts of money

147
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,970
$0.10 couple of dollars and they were

148
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,159
traditionally doing work that would help

149
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,750
with machine learning labeling now

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,090
they're often answering researchers

151
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,940
surveys but they differ from the general

152
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,979
population in that they spend a great

153
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,740
deal of their time online doing these

154
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,210
tasks they also tend to be younger and

155
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,240
actually better educated than the

156
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,370
general US population and finally we

157
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,860
have convenient samples so these are

158
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,050
very very cheap this is like I go and

159
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,570
post on my Twitter and I ask everyone in

160
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,580
sp to take a survey and then I write an

161
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,919
SNP paper next year and I say great I

162
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,990
know how the US opinion feels about

163
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,299
privacy because I asked at people who

164
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,010
are on my Twitter feed sometimes these

165
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,700
can be useful but they end up with a lot

166
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,889
of biases based on the same thing okay

167
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,010
so in this work we compared this

168
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,950
probabilistic randomly sampled telephone

169
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:39,010
data with a census representative web

170
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,110
panel and with Amazon Mechanical Turk

171
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,659
and you can see the differences in

172
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,349
pricing and for collecting these surveys

173
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:49,060
at the bottom okay so we compared

174
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,430
answers to questions about

175
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,700
internet behavior information sources

176
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,740
for protecting yourself online knowledge

177
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,020
of various protective behaviors and

178
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,510
negative experiences with security and

179
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,169
privacy and these questions were drawn

180
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,599
from Pew surveys and other pre-existing

181
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,430
pre-tested surveys so in internet

182
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,220
behavior we asked whether people ever

183
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:16,900
use the internet for social media to

184
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,200
apply for a job to buy products etc in

185
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,049
the case of information sources we asked

186
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,789
where the person turned for advice about

187
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,210
protecting their personal information

188
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,770
online we also asked about whether they

189
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,200
already felt they knew enough about

190
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,469
things like choosing strong passwords

191
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,889
managing privacy settings and protecting

192
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,780
their security when using public Wi-Fi

193
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,300
and finally we asked whether they had

194
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,599
ever had one of a series of negative

195
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,790
experiences in order to compare these

196
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,310
different samples we did a statistical

197
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,830
analysis question by question and we

198
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,289
looked both at the overall samples and

199
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,780
at subgroups in the samples divided out

200
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,789
by age and by education and if you're

201
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,440
interested in checking our statistics

202
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:06,490
are looking at the code that was

203
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:09,490
released with the paper ok so overall we

204
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,020
find that both of the online samples so

205
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,390
both the panel that was census

206
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,150
representative and the crowd work sample

207
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,830
are significantly more likely to report

208
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,380
engaging in a variety of online

209
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:23,770
behaviors so they did more of all of the

210
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,020
behaviors that we asked about the census

211
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:29,020
representative web panel in particular

212
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,140
was more likely to report having had a

213
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,270
bunch of the negative experiences so

214
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,250
they were more likely to report having

215
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,260
had an account hacked at some point in

216
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,049
time having lost a job because of

217
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,789
something they posted online etc perhaps

218
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,400
because they are more active on the

219
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,250
internet or are more aware when these

220
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,470
negative experiences occur Amazon

221
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,380
Mechanical Turk workers were more likely

222
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,450
to report account hacks or having their

223
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,370
information stolen but equally as likely

224
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:01,690
as the general population in the other

225
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,770
categories both of the web samples were

226
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,459
significantly

227
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,810
likely to report seeking advice about

228
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,810
protecting their information from

229
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,089
websites which is perhaps not surprising

230
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,189
given that they are online far more in

231
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:17,410
report more web use and this is

232
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:21,310
especially true for the Amazon

233
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:24,010
Mechanical Turk workers they are also

234
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,579
more likely to report seeking advice at

235
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,560
all and both web panels were more likely

236
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,180
to have sought advice from more sources

237
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,099
so they seemed more interested in

238
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,630
seeking out information on online

239
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,160
protection than the general population

240
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,890
finally the census representative web

241
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,529
panel in particular I was less likely to

242
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,199
feel that they knew enough about various

243
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,890
security and privacy topics except for

244
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,040
passwords and in general all of the

245
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,350
samples felt similarly about knowing

246
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,880
enough about passwords and over 80% of

247
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,160
them thought they already knew enough

248
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,540
about creating strong passwords we of

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,100
course didn't assess whether they were

250
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,930
correct in their knowledge but they at

251
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,890
least seemed done with learning more

252
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,870
about passwords okay we then wanted to

253
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,329
take a look at whether these differences

254
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,570
changed if we look just a certain age

255
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,579
groups and what we find is that Amazon

256
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,260
Mechanical Turk is actually a pretty

257
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,170
good representation of the u.s.

258
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,380
population for those between 18 and 29

259
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,540
years old so out of the 28 questions

260
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,850
that we looked at Amazon Mechanical Turk

261
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,760
differed on only six of those questions

262
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,700
most of them were Internet use questions

263
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,910
so being more active online for those

264
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,920
between 30 and 50 years old MTurk and

265
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,750
the panel performed similarly although

266
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,569
they had differences on different topics

267
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,089
and neither of the samples performed

268
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,339
particularly well for people who are 50

269
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:53,500
years of age or older and these folks

270
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:56,140
make up over 30% of the u.s. population

271
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,420
so a lot of the results of surveys we

272
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,270
have currently on security are not

273
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,829
capturing the experiences of or opinions

274
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:08,260
of those who are over 50 when we look at

275
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:10,900
education and we see a little bit of a

276
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,720
different story so for those who have a

277
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,089
high school education or less only the

278
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,339
census representative web panel has

279
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,930
enough participants with that

280
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,480
educational group for us to actually

281
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,059
make a comparison there are very very

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,439
few people on Amazon Mechanical Turk who

283
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,139
don't have at least some college

284
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:32,199
education and the panel does a

285
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,029
relatively good job of representing the

286
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,089
experiences of those with lower

287
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:39,519
education on the other hand MTurk is

288
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,490
more similar to the u.s. population for

289
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,819
those who have some education and they

290
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,610
are mtech differs in terms of online

291
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:51,069
behavior for those who have some college

292
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,350
and also who have at least a bachelor's

293
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:57,370
degree so we're still seeing that higher

294
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,290
level of activity online in order to try

295
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,990
to see if we could improve the quality

296
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,480
of the Amazon Mechanical Turk data we

297
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,579
tried doing demographic weighting so in

298
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,470
other survey methodology areas where

299
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:10,300
people are doing surveys about smoking

300
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,220
cessation or sexual health

301
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,959
they found that doing demographic

302
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,079
weighting despite the lack of random

303
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:19,719
sampling actually helped in our case it

304
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,609
had very little impact and the fact that

305
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,040
there were significant differences for

306
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,809
the census representative web panel and

307
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,790
that the demographic weighting didn't

308
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:30,429
really help much suggest that the

309
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,629
differences in security behavior may

310
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,569
have more to do with things like

311
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:37,240
internet skill and security experience

312
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:39,120
than with demographics so weighting on

313
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,449
demographics may be waiting on the wrong

314
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,370
factors and so what does this mean in

315
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:48,878
terms of how you actually go about

316
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,069
picking a sample for your servant if you

317
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,769
need to generalize to everybody in the

318
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:56,679
United States then you basically need to

319
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,629
use a combination of samples you need to

320
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,029
pay for one of these probabilistic or

321
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,499
nearly probabilistic kind of samples or

322
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,139
we need to do some additional

323
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:06,879
statistical work to see if we can come

324
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:09,249
up with better weighting variables that

325
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,509
we can use at a correct Mechanical Turk

326
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:15,699
especially for those over the age of 50

327
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:18,550
if you're ok generalizing to only a

328
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:20,649
certain subset of the population then

329
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,990
for those who are 50 or under and have

330
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:26,079
some college education Amazon Mechanical

331
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,670
Turk is a pretty good approximation for

332
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,209
those with a high school education or

333
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,189
less the panel is a

334
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:33,498
in approximation and it's a better

335
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:37,040
approximation for those over 50 than

336
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:39,649
MTurk although still not great so in

337
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,569
terms of future work we need to work on

338
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,819
developing additional statistical

339
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,800
mitigation so figuring out the right

340
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:48,949
rate weighting variables for online

341
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,540
security surveys which you know asking

342
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,639
people questions about the internet

343
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,399
while they are online is fundamentally

344
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,029
different than asking them about their

345
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,769
health behavior through an online survey

346
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,689
and we also need to take care in

347
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:05,540
acknowledging our limitations so if

348
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:07,879
we're using MTurk surveys we are often

349
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,740
missing a large portion of the

350
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:11,779
population who may be especially

351
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,730
vulnerable and this can also be true

352
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,040
even for the census representative

353
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,290
surveys as well so this sometimes calls

354
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,089
for specialized work particularly with

355
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,129
these populations when it's a research

356
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:26,240
question that's especially relevant to

357
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:28,279
them so in summary we wanted to explore

358
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,949
the generalizability of security and

359
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,959
privacy survey results we compared a

360
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:35,089
census representative web panel an

361
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,399
Amazon Mechanical Turk to a

362
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:40,879
probabilistic telephone survey that

363
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,889
represented the United States population

364
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,369
within a confidence in their bowl of

365
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:48,559
2.7% we found that MTurk is pretty good

366
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:50,990
for those 18 to 50 with some college

367
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,329
education and if you're interested in

368
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,220
learning more about designing surveys

369
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,739
and the math behind statistical

370
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,290
weighting and etc I point you to this

371
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,439
white paper thank you and happy to take

372
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,439
questions

373
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,850
thanks so much we have plenty of time

374
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,849
for questions

375
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,500
Luke desert Ellis from Samsung Research

376
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,600
America now that we have these results

377
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,880
and we're aware of the limitations of

378
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,800
MTurk for example which is used very

379
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,260
very often in a lot of these research

380
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,829
papers what would your advice be to

381
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:34,460
paper reviewers who now need to judge

382
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:37,100
whether a survey is sufficient or if the

383
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,690
authors need to go and maybe instead of

384
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,370
just an mtech survey they should go to

385
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,590
even more something more representative

386
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,000
where do you what advice would you give

387
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,820
to reviewers now that we have this

388
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,410
information sure I think a lot of this

389
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,300
really has to do with what the authors

390
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,870
are trying to clean so if I'm making a

391
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,520
tool that is targeted at people who are

392
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,440
particularly privacy sensitive or

393
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,540
particularly educated or something like

394
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,000
that and I do an mtech survey that's

395
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,969
probably alright if I'm trying to make a

396
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,890
claim that some new tool is going to

397
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,500
solve a lot of problems especially for a

398
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,910
marginalized population then you may

399
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,100
want to see even a survey that's

400
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,380
specialized to that population so one

401
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,030
thing I didn't talk about is you can

402
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,460
reach out to a survey company and just

403
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,660
get those who are over 50 or just get

404
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,540
those who have a high school education

405
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,040
or less so I think a lot as a reviewer

406
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,680
is looking at what are people really

407
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,810
trying to do here and are we kind of

408
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:36,260
caveat eing accordingly hi Julia Hansen

409
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:39,500
from University of Chicago so in recent

410
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,990
years it seems like MTurk has had a

411
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,510
quality crisis I know recently when I

412
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,420
ran an enteric study we had a lot of

413
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,060
people using VPNs to access us surveys

414
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,770
who were from outside of the US so I was

415
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,130
wondering if you encountered that kind

416
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:57,740
of this quant of quality crisis and if

417
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,260
you had any advice for researchers as to

418
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,630
how to mitigate that or how that affects

419
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,359
the generalizability of MTurk results

420
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,819
sure yeah and so for the data presented

421
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,599
here we actually had a data set both

422
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:13,369
from 2017 and from what from 2018 so we

423
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,669
were checking like time differences and

424
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:18,649
also MTurk data quality at least between

425
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,990
those two years with these kind of like

426
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,240
has X ever happened to you questions we

427
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,800
didn't see a lot of differences that

428
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,920
said recently I know the V

429
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,290
tn thing has up ticked a lot and beating

430
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,900
some of the Qualtrics and ammeter

431
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,040
controls that were in place before it

432
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,140
would be interesting to collect a

433
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,490
dataset and see if it's changed I think

434
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,620
a lot of this is like a cat-and-mouse

435
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,590
game right people get paid better if

436
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,510
they take us tasks and so they want to

437
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,280
do that and then MTurk and Qualtrics and

438
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,800
researchers come up with new mitigations

439
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,389
that we go back and forth that is an

440
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,940
advantage you get from the panels they

441
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,010
do usually verify mailing addresses we

442
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,010
didn't run into those issues here but I

443
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,629
think it's always a concern and sort of

444
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,640
emphasizes the need for sometimes

445
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,990
collecting more than one sample for more

446
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,820
than one platform to make sure you

447
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:11,050
something wonky didn't happen so to be

448
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,730
s-u-v tio dealt so what's one during the

449
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,440
u.s. are not the world especially not in

450
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,940
the Internet

451
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,980
do you have an internet intuition if

452
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:28,540
this would be different in other

453
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:28,540
countries sure um my suspicion is that

454
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,840
Amtrak would be more representative of

455
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,320
people with even higher education in

456
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,699
other countries so I think in the u.s.

457
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,560
like the fact that MTurk is capturing

458
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,330
the some college two bachelor's was

459
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,800
actually a little bit surprising to me

460
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,780
that would be the main thing that comes

461
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,810
to mind to me as a difference also the

462
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,460
age gap might shrink a little bit but I

463
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,310
don't actually know so that's my

464
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,570
hypothesis but I have it on the list to

465
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:00,960
try to check for other countries let's

466
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,939
think to speaker one more time

467
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,940
[Applause]
