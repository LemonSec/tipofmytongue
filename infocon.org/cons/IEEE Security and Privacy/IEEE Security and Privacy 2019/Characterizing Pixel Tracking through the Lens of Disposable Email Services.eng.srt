00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,240
hi

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,430
everyone my name is Han I am from

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,710
Virginia Tech today I'm going to talk

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,070
about disposable email services and

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,170
email tracking email address is

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,880
popularly one of the most important

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,310
online personally identifiable

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,259
information using email address we can

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,960
link on my activity to real world

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:34,640
identity and that's why leaked email

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,880
address can lead to real life scandal

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,930
and such present a privacy challenge

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,660
Ashley Madison's data breach is a

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,610
perfect example Ashley Madison is a

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,788
website where people look for an affair

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,070
and in 2015 it was hacked in after

17
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,170
amounts 32 million user email address

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,059
were released by hackers many government

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,250
military and corporate email address

20
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,699
were found in a league data and in just

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,010
10 days

22
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:02,449
Nikki users start to face black nose

23
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,370
threats email can also be tracked to do

24
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,009
user profiling let's look at this

25
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,110
example this is an email sent to me from

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,000
Facebook when I try to reset my Facebook

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,220
password at the end of the message

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,470
there is a tracking pixel is usually

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,929
transparent and it's usually one x one

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,090
but I used color black and bigger size

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,250
here to make it easier to observe but

32
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,500
just open the email my email client will

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,360
send a request to the tracker and this

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,090
way the tracker will know whether the

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,810
email has been read at a time a location

36
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,880
and a device associated with the email

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,310
using email tracking technique business

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,979
company can know which email users are

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,469
more likely to open thesis allows them

40
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,000
to infer user preference for targeted

41
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,850
advertisement which might lead to

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,680
discrimination even features can using

43
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,240
email tracking technique to make more

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,829
informed and flexible fishing strategy

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,009
because of all those privacy concerns

46
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:00,979
users go for a alternative solution

47
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:04,430
called disposable email service for

48
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:06,770
example mail job the CC is a disposable

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,899
email service website users can use any

50
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,390
username they want without a password

51
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,360
for example let's use David as our

52
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,670
username and click view inbox we get a

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,370
temporary embossed card David and Mel

54
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,619
job that CC let's say I'm restoring a

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,069
Twitter account instead of using my real

56
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,439
email address I can use this temporary

57
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,958
temporary inbox to finish the email

58
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,328
address verification process and in this

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,829
way the unlike tivity are disconnected

60
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:38,349
with real word identity here we have two

61
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:40,870
research questions first what do user

62
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,450
use disposable email services and what

63
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,530
are potential risk for using it to

64
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,649
understand those two research questions

65
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,689
we did a Merriman study we choose 7

66
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,900
disposable email services and monitored

67
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,739
17,000 disposal inboxes and in total we

68
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,019
collected 2.3 million messages from

69
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,540
210,000 Center domains and finally we

70
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:06,010
use the collected messages to study

71
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,230
image tracking we choose these 7

72
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,129
disposable email services they are

73
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,260
highly popular

74
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,120
according to karela mail to come it has

75
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,060
processed more than 11 billion messages

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,139
with more than 100,000 emails per hour

77
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,299
going in

78
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,120
according to melon leaders privacy

79
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,010
policy all the emails on melody leader

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,900
calm our public readable and

81
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,899
discoverable by anyone at any time

82
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,269
let me first explain what it means that

83
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,849
those disposable inbox are probably

84
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,290
shared remember that I use mail job

85
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,929
that's easy to register a Twitter

86
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,599
account so I triggered this email from

87
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,109
Twitter to this inbox but because the

88
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,750
username David is highly popular at the

89
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:52,389
similar time other users use this inbox

90
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,269
to register Cora and a lot of boardgame

91
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,879
website so disposable email inbox is

92
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,159
shared by multiple users and popular

93
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,069
user dreams are used by more users and

94
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,530
sus receive more messages here's how our

95
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,448
data collection works first we get

96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,729
popular usernames from existing data

97
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,979
breaches then we use those popular

98
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:14,590
usernames to collect messages from

99
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:17,409
disposable emo services in total we

100
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,680
choose 10,000 popular usernames just as

101
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:22,719
info John or the main then we Molitor

102
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,699
knows popular usernames on each of the

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,509
seven website would choose so in total

104
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:30,849
we monitor 70,000 disposal inboxes and

105
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,830
because user use knows inboxes to

106
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:35,229
interact with online services like

107
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,969
YouTube Facebook or Twitter then we can

108
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:40,409
use those inboxes to

109
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,020
to user message then infer user activity

110
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,450
in total in total we collected 2.4

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,770
million messages from 210 thousand

112
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:53,310
centered domains from October 2017 and

113
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:55,780
January 2018

114
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,520
during our data collection we observe

115
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,960
that different services keep user

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,630
messages for different periods of time

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,090
here's how long they claim to keep user

118
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,460
messages but based on our observation

119
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,159
here's how long they actually keep user

120
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,440
messages some of them are not consistent

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,200
some of them keep user messages for too

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,270
long so disposable email services don't

123
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,860
always delete user messages as quickly

124
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:23,260
as neha promised after data collection

125
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,540
we found some risky usages of disposal

126
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,370
services the rich the first risk is that

127
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,470
we found sensitive personally

128
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,210
identifiable information in collecting

129
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,680
messages so we use the regular

130
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,140
expression to look for those sensitive

131
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,450
PII and here's what we have found we

132
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,580
have found critical numbers social

133
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:43,539
security numbers and employer

134
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,150
identification numbers besides NCBI we

135
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,330
also found emails related to account

136
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,219
creation so remember that this is an

137
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,270
email sent to me when I try to reset my

138
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,460
Facebook account

139
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,740
but I wonder how many emails like this

140
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,219
exist in our data set here's what we

141
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,200
have found as you can see we looked for

142
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,020
registration password reset and

143
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,210
authentication code emails their

144
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,150
percentage are not high but there are a

145
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,090
large number of them in total 86,000

146
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,479
emails related to account existing or

147
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,330
data set here are some examples of the

148
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,730
risky usages there are more than 4,000

149
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,770
emails from healthcare.gov some users

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,540
use those inbox to register account

151
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,909
there and those account care sends

152
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,060
information we also found emails from

153
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,620
Air Force and those that account carry a

154
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,080
social security number and date of birth

155
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,960
is very easy for user to reset the

156
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,690
password and get those sense information

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,299
we there are also emails from the iOS

158
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,250
scanner attackers can use the disposable

159
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,850
inbox to receive all the scanned

160
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,270
documents from that account and

161
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:55,790
including signed contract or others

162
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:57,770
sensitive documents this North dataset

163
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,770
of email messages is really valuable

164
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,570
it's rare for researchers to have access

165
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,940
to they store data set of email messages

166
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,120
and indeed to present a valuable

167
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,980
opportunity to study email tracking

168
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,050
previously a mission when Facebook sends

169
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,670
an email to me it will insert a tracking

170
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,530
pixel at the end of the message

171
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,630
but just opening the email my email

172
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,409
client was in a request to a tracker and

173
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,700
this way

174
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,770
the tracker will know whether the IMP

175
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,210
has been read before studying or

176
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,130
tracking we need to know the difference

177
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,650
between first part tracking and sir part

178
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,590
tracking if the tracker is also faced by

179
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,299
comm then it is first part tracking but

180
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,219
it's also possible that Facebook is

181
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,440
using some kind of third party tracking

182
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,000
service let's say it's Google comm then

183
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,620
is third part tracking you know to study

184
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,140
email tracking the first step is to

185
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,120
detect tracking to be a tracking image

186
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,240
tag it has to satisfy either of the two

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,240
conditions first the image URL contains

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,980
a identifier of the receiver so that the

189
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,230
trucker knows the request comes from

190
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,850
certain receiver the identifier could be

191
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,190
the email address of the receiver such

192
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,750
as my new address the identifier could

193
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,410
be the hash value of the email address

194
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,860
such as md5 hash value of my email

195
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,230
address

196
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,120
in total we looked for thirty two types

197
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,540
of hash functions and more than thirty

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,720
three cells and combinations of them

199
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,580
it's also possible that the tracker is

200
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,320
using some kind of ID that we cannot

201
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,719
guess instead of keeping looking in the

202
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,940
form of the identifier we also consider

203
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,030
extreme small image tags as tracking

204
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,310
pixel to your conservative we only

205
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:37,480
consider image tag that has a touch size

206
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:40,400
of 1 x 1 as tracking pixel during our

207
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,580
tracking detection we found some evasive

208
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,500
tracking technique the first evasive

209
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,870
tracking technique is that some image

210
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,150
tag are hiding your actual sizes they

211
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,770
don't have any sites attributes but if

212
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,620
you cure them it turned out to be a

213
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,290
tracking pixel and our solution is to

214
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,570
dynamically fetching all the pixels to

215
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,060
get to their actual size in your dataset

216
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,160
23 four point nine percent of all

217
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,300
tracking images are high

218
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,579
your sizes also we found some Checkers

219
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,069
will redirect you other trackers for

220
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,469
example tracker a comm may redirect you

221
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:17,689
be calm then sitcom then finally

222
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,540
returning a tracking pixel here we call

223
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,660
a a direct tracker and B and C hidden

224
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,490
trackers in our data set 54 points a

225
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,810
percent of all tracking URLs have

226
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:32,269
redirections and in total we identified

227
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,060
2825 hidden checkers here is a list of

228
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,709
top hidden trackers the most popular

229
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,079
hidden tracker is double-click the net

230
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,149
more than 96 thousand emails will

231
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,569
redirect to it and double-click done

232
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,160
that is a complete owned by Google

233
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:48,199
popular hidden trackers retrieve receive

234
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,750
tracking information from a large number

235
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:55,128
of direct trackers in real time after

236
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,439
detect email tracking we can finally

237
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:59,889
answer those two questions how prevalent

238
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:03,050
is email tracking and how prevalent is

239
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:05,000
first party and server checking let's

240
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,630
first look at a few basic statistical or

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,730
data set as you can see twenty four

242
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,220
point six percent of all email messages

243
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,949
and 5.5 percent of all email senders are

244
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,509
performing tracking and what about first

245
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,969
party I can't serve per tracking our

246
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:22,519
result shows that first part tracking is

247
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,009
slightly more popular than for third

248
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,810
part tracking and overall only a small

249
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:31,399
percentage senders are performing

250
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:34,189
tracking we consider center domains with

251
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,910
Xing Alexa top 10,000 as popular senders

252
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:40,670
our result shows that although overall

253
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,839
only 5.5 percent of all senders are

254
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,670
tracking receivers but almost half

255
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,639
popular senders are doing tracking and

256
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:53,290
here are some examples of those popular

257
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:56,329
senders that are tracking receivers

258
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,980
let's compare email tracking to web

259
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,870
tracking web tracking has been

260
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,360
extensively studied Google is the top

261
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,639
tracker tracking 80 percent of Alexa top

262
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,819
ten top one minion web site however

263
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,290
email tracking isn't well understood yet

264
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,939
previously largest email tracking study

265
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,699
only collected messages from the

266
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:16,099
hundreds in our domains we used a much

267
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:18,079
larger email dataset and our result

268
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,180
shows that email tracking is

269
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,370
not as prevalent as web tracking yet

270
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,010
only a small portion of senders are

271
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,750
tracking receivers and email tracking is

272
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,260
not dominated by a single company yet

273
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:33,320
top 10 truckers only covers 31.8% of all

274
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,210
centers who are doing tracking in

275
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,970
conclusion with the first measurement

276
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,250
study on disposable email services we

277
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,280
collected 2.7 million messages from 7

278
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,900
disposable evo set email services and we

279
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,780
provide a new understanding of what

280
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,370
they're useful and it risky usages we

281
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,709
improve CLE analyze email tracking

282
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,840
activities we study prevalence of email

283
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,990
tracking activities and we study the

284
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,660
divisive tracking technique gdpr is

285
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,820
pushing to better protect users privacy

286
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,430
and data and we hope our work can

287
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,710
recruit the vilest of the privacy

288
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,599
concern of email tracking and accelerate

289
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:20,540
the defense and vegetation of the

290
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:22,990
deployment thank you do you have any

291
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,990
questions

292
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,250
hi thanks for the interesting

293
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,020
presentation I had a question about the

294
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,730
first part of the the the thing you

295
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,310
presented about the disposable email

296
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,940
addresses you're relying on being able

297
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,250
to guess the disposable email address so

298
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,170
those are like the examples you gave

299
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,330
like names and info and that kind of

300
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,010
stuff you know to what extent do you

301
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,080
think of can you estimate how that

302
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,090
biases your results because this is a

303
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,750
you know a subset of the things that

304
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:07,030
people typically do this is a very good

305
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,060
question we in your paper we talked a

306
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,040
lot about a bias and so we only choose

307
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,540
like a certain percentage of the other

308
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,120
receiver all the message they received

309
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:21,189
buying those and newsroom we receive

310
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:24,460
right and we we think that we kind of

311
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,100
used that disposable the sender's we

312
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,760
receive as a way to say that we have a

313
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,720
diverse you know messages from a diverse

314
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:38,439
a kind of online services so that would

315
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,380
be like a kind of way to say that we

316
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,650
have you know a great way to avoid the

317
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,650
bias

318
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,710
can you explain it again because I mean

319
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,220
you're saying that you if you observe

320
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,780
several different email sources

321
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,520
associated with one disposable email

322
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:03,430
address then that is an indication of

323
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:06,250
non bias or I think a repeater Crescent

324
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,870
yeah I I didn't quite understand your

325
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,750
response you were saying that if you

326
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,670
receives many different emails from many

327
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,570
different domains associated with one

328
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:19,030
single disposable email address and then

329
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,070
that's the signal of what exactly we

330
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:26,530
receive messages from a diverse kind of

331
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:27,430
senders yeah but what does what does

332
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,220
that mean exactly

333
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,680
and hardly is that meaning the messages

334
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:37,150
are from a diverse source of a diverse

335
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,910
source it is quite representative okay

336
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,699
well let's take it offline thanks maybe

337
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,270
related question so you you you guys

338
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,120
only looked at the user names that are

339
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,040
popular

340
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,959
and those are the ones that are likely

341
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,120
to have multiple different people using

342
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,998
them are the problems you've discovered

343
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,579
at the various statistics actually are

344
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,800
is multiple people viewing them actually

345
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,180
irrelevant to the to the dangers of the

346
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,180
statistics or it doesn't really matter

347
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,878
even if one person is being tracked that

348
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,888
seems pretty bad to begin with but how

349
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:14,180
much worse is that if multiple people

350
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:17,089
can access this tracking information so

351
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,849
we this is a good question we didn't do

352
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,589
a user study to to ask if you actually

353
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,680
know the risk of using this kind of

354
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:27,559
service but based on observation all

355
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,800
those website explicitly tell users that

356
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,800
your messages are public and as for the

357
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,319
perspective of your tracking I don't

358
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,180
think most people will notice in a small

359
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,509
pixel at the end of the message so they

360
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,638
probably don't know do do any of these

361
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:46,579
services prevent users from using

362
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,160
popular names I guess I don't know how

363
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,748
they would do that there are some kind

364
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,360
of services they don't allow you to

365
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,910
choose your name they allocate your like

366
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:03,970
random address yeah there's one question

367
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:06,230
over there where they preload the images

368
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,300
do you notice any of these disposable

369
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,279
email services might do the same thing

370
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:15,589
that like read some of the tracking that

371
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:18,740
occurs are you saying there are some

372
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,009
services well prey load the out the

373
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,800
external images yeah yeah

374
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:28,459
we have notice we have notice on the a

375
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,819
lot of the popular email providers are

376
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:35,660
doing this such as gmail is proxying the

377
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:38,149
out the request sent the external

378
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,219
resources but we don't we didn't observe

379
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,259
that you know and II know this votes

380
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:46,429
were your services are doing this okay

381
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:49,360
thank you mm-hmm okay one last question

382
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:52,839
so you only focused on these one by one

383
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,459
pixels but what prevents someone from

384
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,610
tracking on a larger pixel that's part

385
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,910
of maybe the logo or some

386
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,220
- look we have a letter standard to look

387
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,800
for the identifier of the receiver if we

388
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,959
can find like this is the identifiable

389
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,010
receiver then we also consider as

390
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,220
tracking yeah we have time for some more

391
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,220
questions

392
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,620
thanks for the interesting talk this is

393
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,770
follow-up to one of the previous

394
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:26,599
questions so for example my gmail asks

395
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,210
me whether it should always download

396
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,580
images from a particular sender or never

397
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,940
download images and I was wondering if

398
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,610
you had thoughts on whether that defeats

399
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:40,010
such type of tracking because now in

400
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,040
some sense there's a predefined rule for

401
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,260
Gmail users that images will get

402
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,780
automatically either downloaded or known

403
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,740
are you asking is there a way we can

404
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,020
stop email tracking yet does this defeat

405
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,350
we can there are actually a lot of ways

406
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,300
we can do HTML filtering we can like

407
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,240
Gmail soon we can we can proxy it all

408
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,250
the outcome the requests so that every

409
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,410
everything the tracker gets is from

410
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,620
Gmail it's not from the individual users

411
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,970
we can also preload every image so once

412
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,479
you send an email to me I will always

413
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,850
always read the image like this an essay

414
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,690
from California so the tracker won't do

415
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:27,409
nothing about the individual receivers

416
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:30,110
yeah any last questions okay if no other

417
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,090
questions then we're done a few minutes

418
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,800
ahead of time let's thank hang one more

419
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,209
time

420
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,210
[Applause]
