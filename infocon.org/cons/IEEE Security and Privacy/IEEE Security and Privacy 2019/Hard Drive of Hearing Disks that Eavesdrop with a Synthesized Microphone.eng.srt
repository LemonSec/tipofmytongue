1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,090
thanks for the introduction so our prior

2
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:18,279
research has demonstrated how how

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,520
sensors can potentially intrude on user

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,560
privacy the question we ask in our in

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,359
our paper however is what is the threat

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,570
posed by device is not intended to be

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,219
centers in the first place in particular

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,680
how well can a harddrive approximate a

9
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:33,820
microphone so converting such a device

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,530
into a microphone however it's

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,699
complicated by a few challenges for one

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,070
hard drives are not designed at like

13
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:46,510
friends in the first place there's a

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,340
large quantity of self-noise given given

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,949
the rapidly moving components within the

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:57,010
hard drive and this results in a rather

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:59,350
low signal-to-noise ratio so despite

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,269
that we were successful in demonstrating

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,820
that a attacker can potentially use a

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,809
hard drive as a microphone and

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,969
potentially extract and parse human

22
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,380
speech so we evaluated this side channel

23
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,689
through objective measures of speech

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,699
quality and also demonstrated a use case

25
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,869
a case study in which we use Shazam to

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,209
recognize the song recovered through the

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:20,249
hard drive at the end of the talk will

28
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:22,780
also discuss on potential mitigations ok

29
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:24,880
so in order to turn a hard drive to

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,829
microphone we do require a strong threat

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,908
model in particular we assume that the

32
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:31,990
attacker has fur my resident malware and

33
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,090
this could be actually accomplished

34
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,298
entirely through software any sort of

35
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,439
man-in-the-middle compromise or a

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,569
compromise it gives you a route access

37
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,729
to a machine will allow you to flash the

38
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:46,689
hard drive over software and as one

39
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,670
example in 2007 actually allegedly hard

40
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:53,949
drives were being shipped preloaded with

41
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,090
free malware so so but if you have root

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,399
access on the machine why don't you just

43
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,740
use the built-in microphone well

44
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,630
actually there are a few cases why you

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,089
might want to why that might not be an

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,848
option for example Apple's t2 security

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,640
chip actually a physically disconnected

48
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:11,200
microphone when the user closes the lid

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,290
and also in the same way that some

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,660
individuals a place tape over their web

51
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,950
camera they're examples of security

52
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,230
conscious individuals on the on the

53
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,700
internet actually physically

54
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,899
disconnecting or putting a physical

55
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,129
switch that disconnects the microphone

56
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,680
their device furthermore even modern

57
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,569
modern video gaming consoles often

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,879
utilize hard drives external or

59
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:38,399
otherwise so so now that we've motivated

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,220
the problem I'm going to give a brief

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,379
background that we need to understand

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,019
how this works so hard drives read/write

63
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,670
head operates on sectors which are

64
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,890
arranged in tracks which are which are

65
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,108
essentially concentric circles on the

66
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,328
platter and so the hard drive controller

67
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,250
has to actuate the head to keep to

68
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,620
follow the track and it has to follow

69
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,239
the track with extreme precision I can

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,430
actually only talk about errors on the

71
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:08,109
order of nanometers and so this error

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,599
which we can see in the figure there is

73
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,680
the offset of the head from the center

74
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,530
of the track that's supposed to be

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,989
tracking and the the green circle is the

76
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,430
track it should be tracking this error

77
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,480
is called the position error signal or

78
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,709
the PE s and this PS is a crucial

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,078
component in the feedback control loop

80
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,510
that is used to actuate the head to keep

81
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,340
the head on track so the PS is read from

82
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,560
special sectors on the on the platter

83
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,750
called servo sectors there are a fixed

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,940
number of them per track and as we can

85
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,209
see in the figure here as the head stack

86
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,129
assembly flies over a as the head flies

87
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,440
over a server sector it will read out

88
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:46,090
the PS and then feed that back in as

89
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,650
input to the controller which is which

90
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,440
will then actuate the head to try to

91
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,329
correct the error again there is the

92
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,569
opposite of the head from the center of

93
00:03:52,329 --> 00:04:00,040
the track ok so now that we know the the

94
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,448
basics of how hard drive operates

95
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,099
mechanically we can begin to see

96
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:07,479
similarities between how a microphone

97
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:09,190
operates and how and the PS so the

98
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,549
microphone the output measures the

99
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,829
displacement of the diaphragm as we can

100
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:17,048
also see in the graphic there sound ways

101
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,690
displace microphone which the diaphragm

102
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:23,020
and then the output represents the

103
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,159
acoustic wave with a hard drive the PS

104
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,330
measures the read/write head

105
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:29,590
displacement with a microphone the

106
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,550
oncoming sound waves displace a

107
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,489
diaphragm and and with the hard drive

108
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,710
our assumption is that

109
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,830
the sound waves also displaced the the

110
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,210
read/write head in a similar manner and

111
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,969
so that leads us to conclude that up

112
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:49,620
possibly the PS actually approximates

113
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:53,100
microphone output so to confirm this was

114
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,630
the case we first had to measure two PS

115
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,800
under our threat model the attacker

116
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,450
would just read it through former

117
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,220
resident malware and prior research

118
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,140
exotic at all actually developed a

119
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,610
stealthy hard drive backdoor which

120
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,950
allows the adversary to read and write

121
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,200
arbitrary blocks over the internet for

122
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,270
our proof of concept however we use a

123
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,400
serial diagnostic port to output the PS

124
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,659
and found that doing so allowed us to

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,460
explore the information leakage

126
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,430
available to such an attacker now you

127
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:22,109
can see the setup that we used there so

128
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,760
so after extracting the PS we are still

129
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,880
unsure if it contained enough

130
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,320
information to add sufficiently

131
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,969
approximate a microphone the signal

132
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,950
could easily be too noisy or lack

133
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,030
sufficient granularity after all the

134
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,120
hard drive is not designed to be a

135
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,859
microphone and so we begin to examine

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,250
certain characteristics characteristics

137
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,260
to see to evaluate so one of the most

138
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,870
crucial characteristics many sensors is

139
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,219
the sampling rate and by the Nyquist

140
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,540
Shannon sampling theorem you have to

141
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,160
sample at two times the frequency of the

142
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,920
signal to accurately recover the signal

143
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,210
so for our setup we can actually compute

144
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,490
the sampling rate of the hard drive

145
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,680
microphone as the number of times the

146
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,510
head flies over a server sector which is

147
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,060
just the how many wrote the times it

148
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,980
rotates per second times the number of

149
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,150
server sectors per track in our case

150
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:14,370
given a 70 7200 rpm Drive that's 120

151
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,500
Hertz and there are 288 server sectors

152
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,680
per track so that gives us a sampling

153
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,120
rate of 34 point 5 kilohertz so given

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,070
the audible sound it's between 20 Hertz

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,990
and 20 kilohertz and the male and female

156
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,790
fundamentals are at the bottom end of

157
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,040
that and also that the plain old

158
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:32,340
telephone system only samples at 8

159
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,660
kilohertz we believe that the sampling

160
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,260
rate is more than sufficient and so we

161
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,870
also did some evaluate some of the

162
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,250
spectral characteristics and I'll

163
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,250
demonstrate that through a demo here

164
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,000
all right so I

165
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,370
ok so I have here the same setup that I

166
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,560
showed it in that in that figure so we

167
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,120
have here a spectrogram the way you read

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,790
this is that on the x-axis we have

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,460
frequency on the y-axis we have time and

170
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,740
the color denotes how much energy is is

171
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,479
at that frequency and so we can see that

172
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,470
the baseline at the baseline we have a

173
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,450
fair amount of energy concentrated in a

174
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,880
1.9 kilohertz and 8 kilohertz so that's

175
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,830
kind of where the baseline noise is I

176
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,300
have here one of the original nineteen

177
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,630
sixties Captain Crunch boughs and

178
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,600
whistles which famously plays a 2.6

179
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,460
kilohertz tone so if the PE s does

180
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,920
indeed approximate the output output of

181
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,479
a microphone then if I play this whistle

182
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,650
at it I should expect to see additional

183
00:07:44,480 --> 00:08:02,240
energy in the 2.6 kilohertz band so

184
00:07:47,650 --> 00:08:06,380
let's see if that happens yes so we see

185
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,790
the additional energy there so that will

186
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,790
conclude that demo

187
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,599
okay all right um

188
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:33,360
yes so after confirming that the PS does

189
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,390
potentially approximate the output of a

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,240
microphone we then wanted to evaluate if

191
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:44,339
the we could actually extract human

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,200
speech from the PS so so we the setup we

193
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,490
use for that is a Illustrated here we

194
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,500
have the speaker suspended ten inches

195
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,000
above the hard drive the hard drive is

196
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,580
enclosed in an external hard drive

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,350
enclosure and the fan on it is that

198
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:02,370
should be empowered at max at an X power

199
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:04,170
so so we extracted the PS and that set

200
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,810
up we still have the problem of

201
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,089
recovering speech from the PS readings

202
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,380
if our assumption is correct that the PS

203
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,510
value is approximate the output of a

204
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,150
microphone that is instantaneous air

205
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,950
pressure readings then that they

206
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,720
actually capture exactly what the PCM

207
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,270
values of a WAV file are supposed to

208
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,089
capture so therefore we can take those

209
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,040
values normalize them and stick them

210
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,610
into a WAV file after doing that we

211
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,199
plotted the spectrogram however and we

212
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,470
saw this in the demo as well there is a

213
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,260
pretty strong a large quantity of noise

214
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,920
especially around two kilohertz and

215
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,779
eight killers and this is due to a

216
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,719
number of reasons one is a platter

217
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,610
eccentricity that is that the the disc

218
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,600
of the hard drive are they're not

219
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,180
completely flat and they're not

220
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,760
perfectly round either not perfectly

221
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,010
circular also due to thermal drift

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,750
expansion of aluminum components in the

223
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,060
hard drive can actually result in PSI

224
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,360
readings that errors that are 300 times

225
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,010
the width of a track and furthermore the

226
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,779
right head itself is rapidly moving

227
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,580
across the surface of the disc and the

228
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,470
disc itself is spinning at 7,200

229
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,779
revolutions per minute there's a fair

230
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,330
amount of turbulence so it's not hard to

231
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,910
see why there's a lot of noise there

232
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,690
however after making use of both linear

233
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,819
and non-linear

234
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,920
DSP techniques digital signal processing

235
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,130
techniques to clean the noise that we

236
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,099
got the following results so this is

237
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,640
from a harvard sentence spoken at the

238
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,140
drive and so the harvard sentences are a

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,199
standardized corpus of phonetically

240
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,760
balanced sentence sentences and so when

241
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,960
we did this we could hear a muffled

242
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,410
conversation

243
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:47,520
when we played it at 75 DBA however to

244
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:50,370
get a better SNR we this was played back

245
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,810
at 85 DBA we suspect that more advanced

246
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,690
ESP techniques could substantially

247
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,479
reduce that threshold bill so yeah so

248
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,970
yeah at the top we have that is the time

249
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,250
domain from the audio recovered from the

250
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,010
hard drive wilds in the enclosure with

251
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,430
the fan powered at max beneath it is the

252
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,990
original so just by a visual inspection

253
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,779
we can see that there is substantial

254
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,410
correlation between the two and then the

255
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,500
cross correlation beneath that confirms

256
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:24,120
the spike at zero confirms that

257
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,709
correlation between the two of them so

258
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,080
in addition to our qualitative measures

259
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:30,239
we also quantitatively evaluated the

260
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,089
fidelity of our side Channel one measure

261
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,690
that we focused on on particular is the

262
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,550
PS q MOS and so that's actually

263
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,899
recommended by the telecommunication

264
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,390
unions standard does that

265
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,630
standardization sector for estimating

266
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:49,350
the intelligibility of speech so the

267
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:53,070
baseline which is the raw audio received

268
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,720
a value of 1 point 7 DB when we've

269
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,180
covered audio from the hard drive when

270
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,150
it was not an enclosure we got a value

271
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,709
of 1 point 4 DB and and surprisingly

272
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,920
when we put it in the enclosure it

273
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:06,839
actually increased 1.6 DV and and we

274
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,959
believe that is because the larger

275
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,700
surface area of the container it

276
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,349
captures more energy from the oncoming

277
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:19,110
wave and then transmits it to the hard

278
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:21,060
drive but but I mean what are those

279
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,220
those numbers mean it's I think it's

280
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,500
best if we actually hear an audio sample

281
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,010
for ourselves so this is the same

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,010
Harvard

283
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,000
so I don't know how well you could hear

284
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,290
that but if you put it on your

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,940
headphones on and you play pretty loudly

286
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:56,240
you can you can you can make it out

287
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:59,570
usually okay so we also evaluated our

288
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,910
side channel by use of the Shazam music

289
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,070
recognition app so what we did was we

290
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,030
played Iron Maiden's the trooper at the

291
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,230
hard drive then we extract the audio and

292
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,319
and took that audio and played it back

293
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,280
at a phone that was running this Shazam

294
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,350
app and so the results are that it did

295
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,920
successfully recognize the song however

296
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,330
it required a higher volume 90 DBA which

297
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,540
is actually quieter than typical volume

298
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,490
that this song is played at but the the

299
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,770
increased required volume is largely due

300
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,160
to the fact that um filtering edge'

301
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,630
didn't work at all and so we believe

302
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,219
that's because noise getting

303
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,660
discrimination errors at you ruined the

304
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,010
special fingerprint and the way Shazam

305
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,930
works is that it takes a spectral

306
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,230
fingerprint of the sample and matches it

307
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:50,270
against its database of songs so our

308
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:52,670
particular filtering technique was not

309
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,350
helpful at all but to take away from

310
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,510
this case study was that even though

311
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,050
they recovered audio sounded completely

312
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,010
unintelligible it was extremely poor

313
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,140
there was still enough information

314
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,630
contained in the PS for a state of the

315
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:09,890
art classifier to recognize what which

316
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,060
song it was and and and we believe take

317
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,280
away from that is that our results could

318
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,729
also stand to benefit from a similar

319
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,140
state-of-the-art classifier but beyond

320
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,700
using a more sophisticated classifier

321
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,410
there are some further potential

322
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,590
improvements that week that we could use

323
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,660
for our attack one is an attacker who

324
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,430
can leverage multiple hard drives can

325
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,469
then average the signals that come out

326
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,689
of them and since white noise will

327
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,510
average average to zero and a signal

328
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,520
average to itself the result will

329
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:41,930
improve the signal to noise ratio

330
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,460
substantially and I another technique

331
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,160
that builds off the same principle is

332
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,710
that if even if attacker only has one

333
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,600
hard drive the the attacker can use

334
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,490
autocorrelation to find repetitions of

335
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,410
the same

336
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:58,120
since we often say the same words while

337
00:14:53,410 --> 00:15:00,399
speaking and and by finding those

338
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,980
repetitions you can then average those

339
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,910
together in the same manner and improve

340
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,910
the signal-to-noise ratio

341
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:13,300
so now we'll discuss some mitigations

342
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,120
the best way to prevent or one way that

343
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,079
we discuss to defend systems that are

344
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,630
already deployed in the field is the

345
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:24,939
ultrasonic masking so the idea here is

346
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,490
that a ultrasonic or white noise

347
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,260
generator plays sound in the ultrasonic

348
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,779
range so that it doesn't disturb humans

349
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,579
however due to the limited and fixed a

350
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,920
sampling rate of the hard drive that

351
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,888
will be aliased down into a mask in the

352
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,380
audible range and will then mask human

353
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:46,990
voice and the most common-sense

354
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,630
mitigation for future future drives is

355
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,209
to simply require digital signatures on

356
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,660
the firmware empirically though Zadok at

357
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,420
all

358
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:59,410
did not find any signatures in use on

359
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,060
the hard drives they examined so in

360
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,160
conclusion we believe that our attack

361
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,899
sheds light on a new class of attacks

362
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,610
wherein devices that were not meant to

363
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,920
be sensors in the first place

364
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,510
can still be used to potentially sense

365
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,750
the physical world and intrude on user

366
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:16,240
privacy and we also found that defenses

367
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,600
for already deployed systems are quite

368
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,089
difficult and we answered in the

369
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,449
affirmative that a hard drive can't

370
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:27,220
can't approximate a crude microphone and

371
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:29,740
so and some other applications of our

372
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,389
technique could potentially be any other

373
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,279
device that that measures mechanical

374
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,410
disturbance for example printers which

375
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,649
also make use of a high-precision

376
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,790
feedback control loop and with that I

377
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:46,950
will be happy to take questions

378
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:55,209
[Applause]

379
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:57,550
any time for a couple questions great

380
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,160
doc really enjoyed the demonstrations as

381
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:02,620
well I had a quick question about just

382
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,480
the pattern is it possible at least in

383
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,220
theory to use noise cancellation

384
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,699
techniques to get rid of the noise and

385
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:13,260
then use your techniques on top of it

386
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:16,120
you talk about entirely post-processing

387
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,619
yeah because I'm not sure what part like

388
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,300
I don't understand the technology in the

389
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,979
hard drive and that's where the most of

390
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,589
the noise comes but if it's possible to

391
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,689
just so if you go back to your image on

392
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,208
where you had the noise and the original

393
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:33,790
signal and the autocorrelation yeah I

394
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:35,500
think you know the blue ones wo oh yeah

395
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,510
this one so if you just remove that

396
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,410
central band in some sense from the top

397
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,820
image of noise then you you're kind of

398
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,050
left with what is the original signal

399
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,460
right remove the center the band is sort

400
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:52,030
of the noise and then there's a signal

401
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,160
overlaid on top of it right sure

402
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,600
yeah so is it possible to something like

403
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,580
what a headphone does like a noise

404
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,809
cancellation where you remove you try to

405
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,730
remove the noise synthetically I mean so

406
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:05,800
we did we move to the Strongs ban the

407
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,429
baseline noise just through like I got

408
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,690
like a band stop filter so noise

409
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,380
cancelling headphones those actually

410
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,870
play a wave that the cancels it in real

411
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,370
time see you would actually need to be

412
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:24,899
physically present to do that in our

413
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,899
case right I see okay thank you yeah

414
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,550
was a very nice talk I've one question

415
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,660
like was related to the previous

416
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:39,750
question what kind of signal processing

417
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,270
techniques you were using and were you

418
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:47,520
able to recover the speech in real time

419
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:52,830
or was it like offline processing yes I

420
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:59,910
did entirely offline I suspect that it

421
00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:01,800
can be done in real time though yes so

422
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,510
basically the beyond you're just use

423
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,379
Kanban stop to to filter out the

424
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:10,050
heaviest bands of the persistent noise

425
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,300
we use also a special noise gating and

426
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,559
so that I won't get into exactly how

427
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:20,309
that I guess that works

428
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:27,420
but Makka Minh way to clean human speech

429
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:31,340
from the noisy audio I noticed that this

430
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,840
seems to be due to resonances in

431
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:39,090
mechanical things within the hard drive

432
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:42,659
itself you you refer to two papers that

433
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:45,928
looked into the causes of this and I

434
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:50,700
wondered as a defensive measure and

435
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:53,790
could you add just random little things

436
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,520
into the hard drive with a variety of

437
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:02,100
different resonances and kind of random

438
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,170
application so that when it received a

439
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,240
signal it just kind of reverberate it

440
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,570
with white noise would that be a

441
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,950
reasonable defense yes you're thinking

442
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,189
kind of changed the frequency response

443
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,220
so that it's weaker and the in the band

444
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,350
where human speech is located just just

445
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,950
to add random things to the world

446
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:29,189
tickled so as if you tapped it and it

447
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:32,160
would go new so the thing is it does

448
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,740
need to track the head to keep on track

449
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,840
very closely because it needs to be I

450
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,460
think within like seven nanometers for

451
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:44,000
high performance drives to to

452
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,310
right to a sector so I don't know if

453
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,440
adding additional noise to that is the

454
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,600
solution because then the hard drive

455
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:56,150
can't be is you can't lay the tracks as

456
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:59,659
densely anymore then yeah more time for

457
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,760
one more question well I think my

458
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,730
question was going to be very similar as

459
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,920
far as could you sample less often

460
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,660
without losing much performance but it

461
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,610
sounds like you can't I was a little

462
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,770
curious is there any way you could

463
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,330
inject sound to control the hard drive

464
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:18,800
like like force it to read the wrong

465
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:21,290
sector is that feasible so we looked in

466
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,909
that brief and we actually in a the blue

467
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:27,830
no paper we had it open last year so the

468
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,200
thing is that the the the head will

469
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:35,230
refuse the controller will not write if

470
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:39,980
it's not within the correct margins so

471
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:43,660
we did not manage to to find anything

472
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,310
too fruitful and in that direction

473
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,540
okay great why don't we thank Andrew and

474
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,540
then thank all the speakers from session
