1
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:14,849
hello everyone my name is Hong name from

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,420
and today

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,180
to talk about dynamic security analysis

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,520
I'll take control plane and our tool

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:30,000
named LT pose so let me start with this

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:35,040
short introduction so as you know LTE is

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,739
everywhere and it can be used in these

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,980
days it is widely used in many critical

9
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,390
applications and it is used in everyday

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:50,929
life so the security of LTE is becoming

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:53,979
very very important so before

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,979
[Music]

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,870
Oh

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,370
I think it doesn't work oh yeah

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,280
so before we are talking about the

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,990
details of our LT security let's talk

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,720
let's see how it works

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,470
so first the LT phone is called usually

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,340
Cayman

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,679
in short you e and this u e makes the

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,980
radio connection without mid a nearby

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,730
base station called a note B and using

23
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,230
this radio connection to UE

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,080
communicate with a mobility measurement

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,070
entity Mme to register to the LTE

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,150
network and the this enemy is one of the

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:55,259
most important node in LT core network

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:59,570
so it handles all the critical control

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:04,220
plan procedures such as registration

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,220
identification and user authentication

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,390
and after the UE completes the

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,620
registration procedure it was collected

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,260
finally connected to the Internet

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,810
through the gateways so the key point

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,340
here is that the control plane procedure

36
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,080
is in LTE marked as red lines always

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,530
come before the usual plan procedures

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,870
marked as blue lines so if there's a

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,760
single failure during the control plane

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:39,420
procedures the whole LT service won't be

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:44,519
provided to the LT users so from the

42
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:47,339
attackers perspective yeah so the proof

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,590
also from the attackers perspective the

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,209
exploiting finding exploiting the

45
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,420
vulnerable point in the control plan

46
00:02:51,209 --> 00:03:00,450
procedure are the easiest way to deny or

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:03,000
hack LT services so last year LTE

48
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,640
inspector found various security

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,130
problems in LT specification using

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,589
formal analysis of LT control plane they

51
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,310
found a lot of attacks exploiting

52
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,370
specification problems however form only

53
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,790
analyzing LT specification is not enough

54
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,640
to

55
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,459
potential security problems in LTE

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,379
network because there are several

57
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:33,689
negative in LTE specifications first

58
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,689
they include a lot of exception cases

59
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:39,000
and they also leave freedom to the

60
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,599
carriers and vendors about their

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,540
implementation details they also have

62
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:50,220
protocol conformance test standards but

63
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:53,310
it's not a part of security so from this

64
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,250
fact even if the specification is

65
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,319
correct there the carrier's Network may

66
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,489
have implementation or configuration

67
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,470
books and it is in addition there were

68
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,879
several studies regarding the

69
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,790
implementation of LT control plane these

70
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,250
studies mostly focused on the attacks

71
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,358
using fake base station and using this

72
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,930
vector station

73
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:22,650
the attacker can steal your identity and

74
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,760
track the users location or perform

75
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:30,840
those attack on the victim

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:33,449
however those works those studies mostly

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,000
focused on identifying in the phone side

78
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,270
vulnerabilities then instead of using

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,479
our favorite station were about using or

80
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,990
fake LT phone to test commercial LTE

81
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,659
network and unfortunately to the best of

82
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,180
my knowledge there is very few research

83
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,320
about the trucks iPhone abilities in

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:59,370
commercial ad networks the why is it

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,090
hard test commercial network there in

86
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,340
fact there are huge challenges to test

87
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,500
operational T Network first sending

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,948
malicious signal to a commercial network

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,560
is not allowed and second it is hard

90
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:18,380
control commercial paper Svend chipsets

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:21,419
for simulating malicious behavior third

92
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,150
the carrier's net LTE network is a

93
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,590
closed system so all the information

94
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,138
about their deployment and

95
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:32,489
configurations are hidden by

96
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:35,699
carriers in this research we overcome

97
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,069
these challenges like this so first we

98
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:41,550
got carriers testbed access to test

99
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,919
their network we instead of using

100
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,039
commercial baseband chip set we used

101
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,758
open source LT software and a software

102
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:55,409
device to generate and send malicious

103
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:58,909
inputs we only used device site

104
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:02,719
debugging tools and open source software

105
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:09,029
to decide whether each test case is

106
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:11,669
problematic or not so in our poll is to

107
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:14,129
investigate potential security problems

108
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:17,188
of control plan procedures in the

109
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:20,219
operational IT network to find either

110
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:23,339
the specification or implementation or

111
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:25,889
configuration both we decided to adopt

112
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:29,930
dynamic testing method against

113
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:33,479
commercial teenagers and this is our

114
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:37,620
this is an overview of our tool named LT

115
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:41,370
force first it generate test cases based

116
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:44,039
on LT specification and commercial

117
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,430
control plan loads and then it executes

118
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:50,330
test cases towards both the LT network

119
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,759
and baseband chip search and they're

120
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:57,180
based on the test result we classify

121
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,089
proactive behavior and then lastly we

122
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,509
construct the attacks evaluate these of

123
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:05,279
Teck scenarios with the carrier's

124
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,189
so let me explain the details about our

125
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,770
testing procedure so among various Pro

126
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:14,099
control plan protocols we targeted to

127
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,740
control plane protocol one is radio

128
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,438
reserved control RC which is a

129
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,219
communication protocol between ue & e

130
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:26,969
note B and another one is done access

131
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:30,810
short-term NASA it is also communication

132
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:33,899
protocol between UE and Mme so these two

133
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,909
protocols and the key control functions

134
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,819
such as radio connection establishment

135
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,750
and that well attach a location

136
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,470
management

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,750
session manager for the u.s. the

138
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,930
simplest way to test these two protocol

139
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,960
is to test all the possibilities and all

140
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:55,440
the procedures of this protocol however

141
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,049
there are a number of test message types

142
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,400
and message variations and procedures

143
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:05,130
and even options there for inspecting

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,030
all those combinations are infeasible in

145
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,950
practice so we just narrow down the

146
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,690
scope by defining basic security

147
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:18,060
properties based on LT specification

148
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:22,860
select this we define three security

149
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,980
properties we generate test cases they

150
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:30,330
violate these security properties for

151
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,430
example we insert invalid values to the

152
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,990
sequence number message authentication

153
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:39,839
code or the security hair types and for

154
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,690
the other remaining field values such as

155
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,350
our SC message and last message is

156
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,630
should be randomly mutated however since

157
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,170
we test against the commercial ad

158
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,070
network it is not allowed to tree or any

159
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,500
crush pressures that may disable the

160
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,500
commercial IT services and even in a

161
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,050
carriers test pair network it is not

162
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,990
allowed to do this because as you know

163
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:10,729
there are a lot of engineers working all

164
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,280
day and night to deploy their 5g network

165
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,040
so what we have done is randomly picking

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,760
field values from commercial control

167
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,459
plane loops so first we extracted

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,490
commercial completely commercial control

169
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,940
plane loads from the phones over here

170
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:33,120
and save the field values which are only

171
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:41,130
used in a commercial network and then we

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:45,180
just randomly pick those values so by

173
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:47,670
doing this we should we could not we we

174
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,079
won't cause any memory corruption errors

175
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:56,610
and we just hoped it and it won't happen

176
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,279
and then we generate test cases after we

177
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:03,089
generate test cases we have to test each

178
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,439
case and first the victim Yui is

179
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:10,140
normally registered to the LT network

180
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,140
then we implement it used a monitor to

181
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,170
analyze control point traffic and the

182
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,800
user changes in the victim Yui and at

183
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,099
the same time the tester Yui send test

184
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,649
cases one by one as if it is a victim

185
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,700
Yui within the victim you is identity

186
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:33,630
and each of chats response from the

187
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,779
operation of the network and also use a

188
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,689
monitor checks if the question state of

189
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:42,450
the victim Yui is changed or not by

190
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,959
pinging google.com based on these two

191
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:50,850
data we had to decide whether each case

192
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:54,209
is problematic op9 and the big challenge

193
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:58,980
here is that so many different failure

194
00:10:54,209 --> 00:11:01,439
is observed from each test case so it is

195
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,620
because each carrier has different

196
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
configurations and it deploys different

197
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,120
naturally penguin from different network

198
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,500
vendors and even in a single carrier

199
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,950
network it came one differs by the

200
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,800
service area and it is in addition to

201
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,940
the occasion of the tester I mean the

202
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,469
location of the attacker and the victim

203
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,680
affects the results so there are four

204
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,990
possible cases depending on whether the

205
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,069
attacker and the test and the victim Yui

206
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:41,850
is located in the same cell area or in

207
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:44,220
the area or mne pool area so it is very

208
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:48,060
very easy so confusing when in is done

209
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:52,529
in manually so we develop simple

210
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,829
decision tree like this so here all the

211
00:11:52,529 --> 00:12:00,959
test cases are invalid so it should be

212
00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:03,219
silently drop as in case for benign and

213
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,219
all other test cases

214
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:12,570
are classified as problematic case 1 and

215
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:16,450
case 2 k3 for example case to means test

216
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,370
message with a spoofed ID is accepted in

217
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,940
the receiving entity for example enemy

218
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:27,990
then the attacker can perform spoofing

219
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:31,480
attack 2 as as if it is a victim UE and

220
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:34,990
if the victim you state is changed to

221
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,440
the D registration as in case 1 and case

222
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:42,010
3 then the attacker can just use this

223
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,670
testament test message for performing

224
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,520
dos attack on the victim

225
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,610
this is LT first test environment for

226
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,210
network testing we targeted to network

227
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,490
vendors and it each carrier has

228
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,800
different and various data vendors Mme

229
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,200
vendors annuity vendors and we also

230
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,680
adopted similar approach to test

231
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:12,850
baseband chip sets such as quote on its

232
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:15,250
nose high silicon and MediaTek for the

233
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,350
implementation we implemented test

234
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,340
improved collector and message generator

235
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:24,970
for about two thousand lines of code and

236
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:29,080
protester we modified ssue for network

237
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:32,830
testing and open LTE and SSL te for

238
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,410
baseband testing we also implement a new

239
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,720
state monitor by using signaling

240
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,380
collection another and analysis tool

241
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,050
which is also an open source software to

242
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:50,350
extract a control plane traffic from the

243
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:53,550
phones so here's our findings so in

244
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:57,370
total 51 cases are classified into

245
00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:01,060
productive behavior and among them 36

246
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:04,060
were new findings and 15 was previously

247
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,479
known vulnerabilities so these are

248
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,010
mainly categorized into five

249
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,110
vulnerability types and we also

250
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,380
validated our findings

251
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,279
- with the corresponding carriers and

252
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,980
vendors

253
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,470
l.joe jolt there were no false positives

254
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,709
but there were two false negative cases

255
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,389
and this is because the response from

256
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:29,029
the operational network was just

257
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:31,399
encrypted so our decision tree cannot

258
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:36,019
correctly decide whether these cases

259
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:38,809
accepted or not so this is the tables on

260
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:42,050
our table of our findings and we just

261
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:46,370
list the possible to cases for each test

262
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:49,160
message so the left side the rest but

263
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,499
the red path shows the specification

264
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,629
problem and the blue path shows the

265
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:56,120
implementation problems from different

266
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,370
enemy vendors and the green path shows

267
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,040
the implementation problems from the

268
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,379
different basement chipset and if you

269
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,349
see the yellow paths there are two

270
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:09,319
different activities in one test message

271
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,379
and this means that different amine

272
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:17,870
vendors had different vulnerabilities in

273
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:20,120
different a cases and from now on I'll

274
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,220
introduce one attack scenario

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,519
among the various attacks we have

276
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,790
validated with the carrier's so did so

277
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:32,000
the attack is remote the register attack

278
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,519
here the attack couragous is poised one

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,660
of the 15 venerable cases in NASA

280
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,370
procedure so the victim UE is normally

281
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,170
registered to the operation Alateen

282
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:47,920
Network and the attacker makes an RC

283
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:53,059
collection as if the victim UE and

284
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,969
trigger invalid nos nos procedure using

285
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:58,240
the victim use identity then your

286
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:01,490
personal T Network just thinks that

287
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,399
something with something went wrong with

288
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,339
the victim UE and just change the state

289
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,120
of the victim UE from register to the

290
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,370
detached

291
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:17,689
then the victim you a cannot receive any

292
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:20,839
LT service ago and for after some time

293
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:25,699
the victim ua just unrated to the level

294
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,910
network such as 2g and 3g and here's the

295
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,910
demo

296
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,878
the attacker and the victim is apart

297
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:36,769
from 3.6 kilometer which means attacker

298
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:42,069
and lifting is connected to a different

299
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:47,420
unit B but insane MMA pool area and

300
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:47,839
Emily pool area is oh I didn't start it

301
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,139
yet

302
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:55,819
sorry yeah

303
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:59,779
so on April 15 is collected so different

304
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:02,209
you know be and it is country to it is

305
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,250
it is within the same area pool area and

306
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:04,720
many pool area is known to be very very

307
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,679
large

308
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,110
right after the attack start the victim

309
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,110
you eat is just discounted from the

310
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:18,408
network whatever the victim he tries to

311
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:21,678
do it is fail it failed to connect to

312
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:25,189
the alternator again and after some time

313
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,980
the victim you a time would downgrade in

314
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:35,270
to 3G network which is known to be much

315
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:38,450
less secure than LT so for all of our

316
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:41,480
findings with responsabilities closed to

317
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:45,049
cross funding bodies such as standard

318
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,720
bodies through the PP and gsm a and for

319
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:50,480
the implementation bugs reported to the

320
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,390
corresponding vendors network vendors

321
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,530
investment chip offenders and for the

322
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,630
implementation polls

323
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:02,418
it will be paid soon so in overall we

324
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,390
had to know that operational t networks

325
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:08,419
are very very complicated and not as

326
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:11,270
secure as we expected and you know

327
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,789
operational 18 and in a real operational

328
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,280
t network the carrier has different

329
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:19,129
configurations and deploys different

330
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,879
network in one by service area and this

331
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,520
kind of complicated deployments generate

332
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:30,200
extremely complicated behavior so some

333
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,840
time for some sometimes the attacker can

334
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:38,030
split this kind of complicated behavior

335
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:40,668
to attack or have deny LT services so in

336
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,789
this research we have implemented

337
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:47,559
tifa's or semi-automated dynamic testing

338
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:51,769
tool for both networks and devices and

339
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:55,009
we identify by using this LT first we

340
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:57,980
identified various vulnerabilities using

341
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:02,509
open source LT software and a simple

342
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:05,359
decision tree OT FERS considers or

343
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:07,309
realistic assumptions in operational T

344
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,918
Network all I previous studies just

345
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:13,070
assume or simplify network environment

346
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,769
then as a future work with lighting

347
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,129
stand LT first to support other protocol

348
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:21,710
controller other control protocols that

349
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:25,369
is not investigated yet and we also

350
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:29,119
would like to test 5g if the open source

351
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:32,949
version of 5g is a lot so thank you and

352
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,949
I'll be happy to take any questions

353
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,928
set of attacks we have time for one or

354
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,039
two questions please

355
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:46,879
I'm shooting from CMU is it correct to

356
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,429
say this is a stateless father or if in

357
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:52,369
the case of stateful with the techniques

358
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,200
like this work well so in RC and nos

359
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:57,019
there are very complicated state

360
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,929
machines and in here we just assume

361
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:04,429
there are toothpaste the registration

362
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:07,659
are in RC I do and collect it and in nos

363
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:12,080
it is to registration and crafty state

364
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:14,539
and one more question is is it looks

365
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,189
like you're inferring the message format

366
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,179
from the control law is that correct

367
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,009
yeah right

368
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:23,720
I see so if what was the reason because

369
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:26,779
there are many other techniques to infer

370
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,460
the protocol format yeah so what was the

371
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:30,529
reason you - I'm just curious why you

372
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,779
took that approach opposed to a lot of

373
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:36,190
existing approaches to infer the

374
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:38,989
protocol format so the main reason I

375
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,320
used control playing commercial

376
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:45,080
entrepreneur is to not to see not to

377
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,570
learn about all the permits apart from

378
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,189
the specification another reason is that

379
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:54,990
we should not trigger

380
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:58,860
Crash's by randomly making the message

381
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,600
formats thank you so just a quick

382
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,389
question thank you very interesting talk

383
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,090
could you cook the attacker choose the

384
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:08,100
victim I missed that point yeah sure if

385
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,250
the if the attacker does know the

386
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:16,740
identity of the victim then yeah thank

387
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,000
you one more round of applause for Hong

388
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,670
you

389
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,670
[Applause]
