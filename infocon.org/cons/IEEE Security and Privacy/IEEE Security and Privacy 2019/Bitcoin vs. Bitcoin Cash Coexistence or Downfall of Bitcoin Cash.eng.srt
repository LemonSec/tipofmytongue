1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,850
thank you for interesting me yeah

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,430
hi I'm using from Christ you know today

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,240
I'm gonna talk about the economics of my

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,029
knee so the actually it specifically

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,310
with the remaining hotter with we know -

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,790
sure the church and what is the dynamics

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,660
so I'll answer to these questions in the

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,610
rest of this talk this is a you know

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,379
this is a during work who is professor

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:45,329
Hong Sheng and Gino and my other virtual

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:48,469
room day okay so first of all is a bit

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,699
concat actually is the Bitcoin

13
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,300
suppressed from better transitions

14
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:57,179
calibrating so several solutions were

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,050
proposed however there was political

16
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,660
complete indeed solutions so due to this

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,450
conflict between was eventually split

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,940
into Bitcoin and between cash orbitty

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,040
speciate which it has increased

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:17,820
transition scalability through a simple

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,390
idea that is an increase on on both

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,289
sides

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,560
so between had one megabyte algebra 5y o

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,230
Bitcoin cash had a megabyte edible

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,410
science now the list they have a

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,660
comparable money algorithm here the

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,830
comparable money algorithm means the

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:42,449
miners can conduct both bc8 MBT mining

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:47,490
with one money hardware in this

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,970
situation how do you - behave now surely

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,289
rational - first always always pursue a

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,510
higher profit so depending on the

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,550
profitability of coal mining - can

34
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,120
dynamically switch the Queen to be mind

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,729
if it's the more profitable to condole

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,380
BTC money then they can dynamically

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,810
conduct British mining

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,930
otherwise if which more profitable to

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,860
conduct PTH mining then they can conduct

40
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,260
research mining even look the coin

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,720
mining profitability depends on the boss

42
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,970
when price mining difficulty

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,910
however we should not they're predicting

44
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:31,380
of the Queen prices quite more difficult

45
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:35,040
than the mining difficulty so the in due

46
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,650
to this property we can observe the

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,170
sudden large power movement

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:46,290
only when the coin mine difficulty

49
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:55,980
changes for example look at this can I

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:03:02,940
use generation yeah yeah I don't I can

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:06,600
use the leisure okay okay yeah so look

52
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,390
at this figure the utter start of the

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,900
gradient the bishop a bit Queen mine

54
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,140
difficulty decreased so large power

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,070
moves from BTC to officiate at the end

56
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,760
of the gradient the BCH mine difficulty

57
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:29,060
increase okay so because of that the has

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,060
large hushpower move from PTC to vitiate

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,670
to capture this behavior we formally

60
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,340
defined the peak of mining so for you to

61
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,369
understand a so you can see this figure

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,950
of equal minor judges has coin as the

63
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,530
interval between turquoise only when the

64
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,070
Queen mine difficulty changes so in this

65
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,830
figure at TJ rule the pH bountiful T is

66
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,430
high so large in mining power is

67
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,520
involved in the Bishop BTC mining after

68
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:03,000
that at T 1 the vitiate mine difficulty

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,709
decrease so the larger has power moves

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,660
from B to C to B CH after that a t2 the

71
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,209
research ban difficulty increased

72
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:18,269
because of that the large mining power

73
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:21,030
moves from PCs to PTC then considering

74
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,609
this peak remaining one will happen more

75
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:30,030
formally water Calabria in the situation

76
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:32,220
and how will the money power change so

77
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,809
to descend we consider became and

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,800
analyze this

79
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:41,820
there are two types of player first many

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:46,560
- Whismur much power and second ho th

81
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:50,130
factions the first type is the usual

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,370
rational minor so the usual rational

83
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,400
minor finally choose the most profitable

84
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,620
run among three strategies first pick

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,679
remaining a second own repetition mining

86
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,620
and third only be search mining that is

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,620
depending the profitability of strategy

88
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:12,270
the miner can dynamically choose the

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,820
most profitable we should note that only

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,849
petition and only research mining

91
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,520
cluster they continuously conduct

92
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,480
petition ambitious respectable to go to

93
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,289
waste of the combined difficulty however

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,240
the truth hi Berta second type of miners

95
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,669
quad-core Abhishek factions are

96
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,030
concerned only about the maintaining

97
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:38,280
their distance between cows for example

98
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,409
we can consider be main we manage the

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,890
biggest company producing mine harder

100
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,130
and be made was the involved in the

101
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:51,840
birth of bitcoin castle so we may may be

102
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,210
such affection and they can only conduct

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,830
research mining in other words they only

104
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:02,370
choose only wish - strategy this

105
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:06,120
triangle figure representative state so

106
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,360
where x axis represent the hash pareció

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,200
pic remaining and y axis represent the

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,870
hash pareo only PCH mining because the

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,330
hash power ratio thumbs of Vikram mining

110
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,539
and mrs. mining is a less than 1 the

111
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,760
state should be presented inside the

112
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,860
triangle

113
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:30,390
moreover K represent the price ratio

114
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,880
between B shades and petition we can

115
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,050
divide into three Jo so depending

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,610
depending on the strategy profitability

117
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,979
so in the first journey its most

118
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,990
profitable to condom only petition

119
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,449
mining

120
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,550
in the second zone its most profitable

121
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,039
to conduct only appreciates mining and

122
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,259
in the fight in the final journal its

123
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,639
most profitable to conduct week

124
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:58,220
remaining according to the division of

125
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,210
regions the state moves along the cross

126
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:05,360
funding arrow so for example you you can

127
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,219
see the first jump as I said before in

128
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,850
the first shell only with each mining is

129
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,979
the most profitable so - Ruth changed

130
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,770
their choice to only pitch mining and

131
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:21,469
the red arrow in the first joined the

132
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:24,130
acosta cause the sauce were stirred so

133
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,710
now I will describe what is equilibrium

134
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,020
so to describe this I will divide into

135
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,138
four case depending on the hash power

136
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,870
ratio full curve PCs factions in the

137
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:39,440
first case the relative power ratio

138
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,780
protocol business factions Israel there

139
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,580
are two type of equilibria first the

140
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:50,419
coexistence and the town for obesity the

141
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,969
yellow point is questions and below the

142
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:56,570
yellow line is the town for obesity

143
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,210
where there is no vision or a - so this

144
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:04,180
is in in the state of the down for

145
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,888
wishes BCH blocks cannot be generated

146
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,949
moreover we should note the town from

147
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,919
obesity from K 0 to 1 0 in other words

148
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:17,570
the happy occurrence of fickle money is

149
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:20,030
equilibrium the second zone the hospital

150
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,400
ratio political research fraction is

151
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,000
small there are also two type of

152
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,020
equilibria first quotients and second or

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,049
lack of issuer - and the red line

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,689
indicates when hash power ratio moving

155
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:38,890
in only BCH mining is equal to the

156
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,599
hospital ratio with pH of fractions

157
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,750
therefore the local wishes you well -

158
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,220
implies that the only political vitiate

159
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:52,100
affections are preciate lower minors in

160
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,329
the third case when the hash power ratio

161
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,179
political wishes factions in

162
00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,269
small also there are two equilibria as

163
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:04,019
questions and/or like obesity where -

164
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:09,509
and this point is Kristin and this

165
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:11,519
yellow point is a lack of vision or - in

166
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:14,299
the final case the hash bar ratio

167
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,420
political vitiate affections is a large

168
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:21,360
there is only one equilibria on lack of

169
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,639
pH you are minors here you can wonder

170
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,309
why this tie to represent all the code

171
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,470
which you are - because you can think

172
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,379
the interstate the Lua

173
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,410
vitiate shipment in empower is you know

174
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:36,779
but not the large mining power is

175
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:42,389
processed biofuel and the test called

176
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:44,579
preciate political fiction until now I

177
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:48,029
did I described that there are two

178
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:51,299
equilibria first questions second all

179
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:53,699
the cobia children - by the way does the

180
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,819
state really move in practice according

181
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:59,279
to our theory what happened in practice

182
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:03,628
and it is no lack of there are - really

183
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:07,019
dangerous actually in the reality though

184
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:10,290
came between BTC and bitch h-sorted

185
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:14,100
on August 1st 2017 this state is the

186
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:17,009
birthday of mythical cash so in doctor

187
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,160
agent at the oval the oval figure

188
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:24,749
represent actual data of the hash power

189
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,299
of each pal ratio of Bitcoin cows in the

190
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:31,619
region vicar minors should conduct

191
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:34,230
between cows we try to map each state

192
00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:36,269
into our triangle zone to do this we

193
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,850
also collected the Queen priced and

194
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:42,929
minor difficulty for more detail you can

195
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:46,259
see you can see our paper and game start

196
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:48,929
the point moves downward as shown in the

197
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,600
below figure specifically the state the

198
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:57,329
point is originally in jump first and

199
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,379
then goes down to June to enter that the

200
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,479
state moved

201
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:04,439
angel 3 where the combining is most

202
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,860
profitable so the hash power involved in

203
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:10,199
Vic remaining largely increased

204
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,860
in the Triangle figure you can see the

205
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,170
red and black arrows the red arrows

206
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,810
missed movement of hushpower in

207
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,199
agreement with our theory while the

208
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:26,010
black arrow is the movement the very

209
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,440
from our theory actually we were able to

210
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,020
observe some deviations when the state

211
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,080
point is caught two boundaries options

212
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:38,100
for example you can see the second

213
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:42,780
figure so you can see the black arrows

214
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:46,230
in this figure as a result before

215
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,829
November 13 2017 the stitches was closed

216
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,530
to the tonfa of wit quincas and at that

217
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:58,140
time the Bitcoin cash States suffer from

218
00:11:52,530 --> 00:12:00,630
the lack of will or miners what does the

219
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,750
locals were - Influenster between cash

220
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,689
system there are three things first

221
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,180
worst calamity the Bitcoin cash

222
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,000
transactions was the process bid

223
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,729
critically became though and it even

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,330
took four hours to generate one below in

225
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,870
some cases second the lower level of the

226
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,750
centralization there are only five - and

227
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,960
only two account you generated some

228
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,470
represented lots and finally the lower

229
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,720
level was secreting dosha stamatis off

230
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,450
server to top responding attacks with

231
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,200
only one to two percent of the torille

232
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,540
conditional power as a result

233
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,680
scalability - some conversation as

234
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,660
security

235
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:51,180
all of them are undermined however there

236
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,750
was a good thing on Bitcoin just between

237
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,949
cash system there was a hard walk in the

238
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,700
Witkin cash system

239
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:03,120
so between has updated its mining

240
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,370
difficult adjustment algorithm this

241
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,050
change of factor theater came as an

242
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:13,800
external factor so in other words due to

243
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:16,680
this hard work on november 13 2017 the

244
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,829
status jumped from john 3 into John -

245
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:23,609
not that that not that in John 2 toast

246
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:29,290
this becomes close to the cohesion

247
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:32,530
coexistence so in practice toast at this

248
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,900
point gradually become close to the core

249
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:39,100
instance this reason this is in

250
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,970
agreement with our theory now between

251
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,970
cashier safe

252
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,579
actually there is another scheme quote

253
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,160
automatic mining in this scheme -

254
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,040
automatically choose the most profitable

255
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,430
and this game has already been popular

256
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,930
there is a mining pool called multiple

257
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,910
suffering this scheme and also because

258
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,370
usually between money to support one

259
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,760
bottle switcher functions so usual miner

260
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:14,500
can implement the automatic manual or

261
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,930
deep technical knowledge want the

262
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,200
automatic mining can be stated or gave

263
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:22,839
as follows when the Queen price remind

264
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,710
difficulty changes - can immediately

265
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,110
switch the Queen to be mined here what

266
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:33,160
is the difference between ultimate - Vic

267
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:36,090
remaining remember that in the coal

268
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,010
mining only when mine difficulty changes

269
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,190
the miners can immediately switch the

270
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,960
Queen to be mined

271
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,030
therefore total mining can be considered

272
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,910
to be automatically choosing the most

273
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,449
profitable run among remaining and only

274
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:57,550
British mining and me pH money in real

275
00:14:52,450 --> 00:15:00,610
time an RKO nurses can be applied to the

276
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,630
inertia stop perfect after too much

277
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:07,330
money again consider the triangle figure

278
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:10,090
this red line your project that offical

279
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,330
mining has power ratio is the same as K

280
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:18,190
which is the price of price ratio

281
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:20,290
between between cash and bit Queen in

282
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,770
the right side of the red line a red

283
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:26,949
line all all errors move downwards in

284
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:30,040
other words in the region the BCH were -

285
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:33,390
all decrease concerning this fact we can

286
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,760
conclude that when of an array she okay

287
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,430
of the troll mining power is involved in

288
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,760
the automatic mining then the state

289
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:47,160
moves toward Ola Co bit quick cash to

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:49,650
our miners Cronulla K is about 5% so

291
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,410
Bitcoin cash is still not safe

292
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:55,470
well 5% of hushpower is involved in

293
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,260
automatic mining and there are all

294
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,940
heartbroken the Bitcoin cash register so

295
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,520
eventually with quick cash system was

296
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,300
bullied into Bitcoin ABC and between us

297
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,220
we between two coins there was a huh

298
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,630
sure this what you literally on

299
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,270
aggressive were actually this has you

300
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,939
belongs to the fourth case where there

301
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:21,569
is only one equilibrium as a black curve

302
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,780
between cash fewer miners with the

303
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:29,010
tastes of the hospital ownership check

304
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:32,850
our paper then how about either you

305
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,790
enduring clashing we shall our came can

306
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,710
be generalized in other words our

307
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,360
ownership can be applied to any two

308
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,540
coins that have comparable mining

309
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,790
algorithms the only important

310
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,560
requirement is the major coin should

311
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:51,089
have a magnificant is similar to between

312
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,969
currently between my difficulty is or

313
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:59,370
justed every every every 2016 block so

314
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,260
this this part implies the major

315
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,540
question of just my difficulty

316
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:08,730
adjustment with a relatively long period

317
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:11,190
of time currently between country there

318
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,640
has a short mining difficulty adjustment

319
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,610
period

320
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,520
so to undermine the miner Queen enduring

321
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:20,099
classic them either insured your hard

322
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,730
work for mining difficulty adjustment

323
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:26,099
argue obtains but the update is not hard

324
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,130
so we already observed many sources

325
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:32,699
voltage of mining difficulty algorithm

326
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:36,750
as a result interim can undermine the

327
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:41,250
classic so mining difficulty of mining

328
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:43,950
difficulty adjustment arguing update in

329
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,950
summary survey combining ultimate mining

330
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,740
one major coin conundrum

331
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:56,570
in the house of the Minor Queen yeah

332
00:17:48,740 --> 00:18:03,500
thank you for once awesome very

333
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:05,629
interesting talk any questions let me

334
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,260
start up start off as a was a question

335
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,540
do you see you observed a lot of

336
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,250
fluctuations and a lot of variation in

337
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,460
hashing power did you consider any

338
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,440
mitigations that would allow you to

339
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:25,100
saturate or or protect against these

340
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:27,320
kind of fluctuations we observed many we

341
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,949
observed a lot of fluctuation in hash

342
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:36,770
power and we can observe so d'etat

343
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:38,840
marches so and we can we can we can

344
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:42,080
concern this fluctuation the traffic

345
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:48,649
remaining so the Queen priced and my

346
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,990
difficulty data and they and going past

347
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,390
analyzing can you mitigate people's

348
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,190
which enforcement and reduce the

349
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,510
security risks that are exposed yeah

350
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:02,990
yeah so actually as I said before the

351
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:06,140
hard work of the Bitcoin mining Bitcoin

352
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:09,200
cash mine difficulty update can be

353
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:13,130
mitigated can mitigate the hash power

354
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:18,740
fluctuation because because after hard

355
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:21,290
work sorry after hard work of it quick

356
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,380
ask mine difficult adjustment every day

357
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:29,300
between mine difficulty is adjusted or

358
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:33,680
relatively fast so minor fear only to

359
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:36,320
change your Queen mining yesterday yeah

360
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,990
right so your answer would be to change

361
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,320
the economic incentives to reduce the

362
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:47,200
amount of switching that the miners do

363
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,200
yeah thank you yeah any other questions

364
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,610
thanks for an interesting talk Eugene

365
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:57,390
yeah thank you

366
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,389
[Applause]
