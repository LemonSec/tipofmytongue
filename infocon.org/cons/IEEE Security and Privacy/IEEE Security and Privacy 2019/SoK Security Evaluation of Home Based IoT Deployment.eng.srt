1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,280
thank you hi everyone

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
my name is Omar al Ravi I'm a PhD

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,070
student at Georgia Tech today I'll be

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,040
presenting our Sok work on the security

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,110
evaluation of home-based IOT deployments

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,750
so I want you to imagine a situation

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,270
where there's a burglar who's trying to

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,900
break into a house so they would have to

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:37,300
do a forced entry by either breaking a

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,269
door or window setting off an alarm and

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,720
then they're rushed to take as much

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:47,680
things as possible and leave and what's

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,829
interesting is if you are exposed to

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,260
tech media you'll hear stories where it

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,239
says hey actually a thief doesn't have

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,579
to do that they can just walk up to your

17
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,968
door and yell Alexa unlock the front

18
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,219
door

19
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,739
and the front door with a lock the alarm

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:05,289
is disarmed and the thief can clean up

21
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,860
the place pretty quickly so that's a

22
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:11,259
funny story but when we think about AI

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,149
Internet of Things it's easy to buy into

24
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,729
these stories because we see these

25
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:17,560
headlines all the time the internet

26
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,929
things are doomed in terms of security

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,170
it's a big dumpster fire nobody

28
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:25,060
containment and you have that the

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,459
security of these devices is just a

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,090
nightmare to manage and that's easy to

31
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:31,420
see

32
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,979
just because you have complex devices

33
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,450
that are connected to the Internet you

34
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:39,099
have devices that have voice command to

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,649
to be able to talk to to interact with

36
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,750
and then you have another Alexa type of

37
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,940
device that has a screen with a camera

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,220
and talks to Facebook and then you have

39
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,229
an oven that watches your food and

40
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,950
streams videos of it across the internet

41
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:56,229
and then a fridge with a gigantic tablet

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,869
is why not so personally I don't know

43
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,750
what type of risk or what type of

44
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,539
exposure I'm doing if I buy a connected

45
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,380
fridge here and so you can think about

46
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:11,319
you know our parents or grandparents who

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,970
you know have no idea how to you know

48
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,640
they come asking question whereas the

49
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,859
Start menu on Alexa I don't know if Alex

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,359
that runs Windows XP right it's that's

51
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,079
an easy question to answer but when they

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,850
ask hey is there is this safe to have in

53
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,520
my house am I going to be hacked

54
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,680
know how to answer that I and and and

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,960
and and it's very hard to quantify just

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,440
because there are so many components to

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:38,080
this device it's important to note that

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,620
there has been prior work to quantify

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,650
these security issues and devices things

60
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,250
that have looked at at platforms

61
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:51,400
platforms of the the iot devices

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,340
attacking the voice interface securing

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,580
some of the platforms skill squatting

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,100
for apps that are run on these voice

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,760
enabled devices so there's a lot of a

66
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,769
lot of these a lot of this work that has

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,320
already been done and and it actually

68
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,360
highlights the security landscape of

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,640
this devices and these are very

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,020
important but how would I use this

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,559
information how can I use this

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,210
information and tell my parents

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,070
this device is a good device this device

74
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,260
I wouldn't put it in my home but that's

75
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,910
that's your choice and it's it's not a

76
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,480
straightforward process you can't just

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:30,040
tell them go read this paper because

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,980
there's there's that knowledge gap that

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,970
they have to know about so wouldn't it

80
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,590
be nice to be to be able to say hey I

81
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,410
bring this device home I want to know

82
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,960
what Cloud endpoints it talks to I want

83
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,840
to know what what services it exposes on

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,390
the network what about the mobile app

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,870
I'm setting up this device on in my home

86
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:56,500
and I have to download an app and

87
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,480
install it on my phone which has a lot

88
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,490
of personal information and what about

89
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,410
the network does it degree degrade my

90
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,430
quality of service and my home network

91
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,480
answering these questions would be

92
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,130
really nice and be able to quantify the

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,859
the landscape or the ecosystem of these

94
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,540
devices something like consumer reports

95
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,030
right so Consumer Reports gives you like

96
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,850
a lot of reliability gives you how easy

97
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,609
to use the device but imagine something

98
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:28,600
like this but for the security aspect of

99
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,330
the device so we set out to look at the

100
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,940
prior work and see how can we look how

101
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,300
can we leverage prior work to be able to

102
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,680
answer these questions so what we found

103
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,389
is a lot of the

104
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,759
work focuses on studying the device

105
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,889
itself the network that is associated

106
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,850
with these devices and the cloud

107
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:51,630
integration services so like IFTTT the

108
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:56,050
mitigations proposed were mostly

109
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,120
patching and patching carries the

110
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,539
responsibility for the vendor because

111
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,050
they control that software that runs on

112
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:06,820
the device we also found some areas that

113
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,039
would be interesting to explore like the

114
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,780
mobile app the mobile app has inherent

115
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,000
trust with your device the cloud

116
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,479
services that backends you have Amazon

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,970
you have your you have Google who are

118
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,979
offering these IOT backends that would

119
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,470
be interesting to see what type of

120
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:29,500
security issues are there and then

121
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,660
secure network discovery protocols a lot

122
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,940
of these devices run you PMP and we've

123
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,340
known you PMP to be insecure for 15

124
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,310
years but they're still and even devices

125
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,810
that you go buy off-the-shelf today and

126
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,430
then finally user control and visibility

127
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,120
to be able to actually get a sense of

128
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,220
what the device is doing on your network

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,770
so this is what the prior work has done

130
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,570
has done and we said okay we want to

131
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:01,180
step back a little bit and kind of get a

132
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:02,979
holistic view of these IOT devices so

133
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,020
what we realize is that when you bring

134
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,810
this device home and you set it up you

135
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,849
are downloading a mobile app to set the

136
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,650
device up and once it's set up it's

137
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,440
actually talking to a cloud endpoint or

138
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,120
several cloud endpoints and then within

139
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,740
that there are there is the network

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,400
communication that exists between all

141
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:24,820
these components and this framework that

142
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,258
we propose is useful because we can

143
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,500
actually use something like this to

144
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,820
apply it to all types of devices so it

145
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,669
doesn't matter if it's a vacuum cleaner

146
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,729
right or if it's a media device I can I

147
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:40,870
can apply this to any any connected

148
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:43,630
device over the Internet so we use we

149
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,560
use this too we said okay let's use this

150
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,570
framework to evaluate the off-the-shelf

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,200
devices and see what kind of things we

152
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,730
can find

153
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,240
so we wanted to do it in a systematic

154
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,400
way so the first thing we need to be

155
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,930
objective transparent measurable we're

156
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,940
producible these these are properties

157
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,190
that we want when we do our evaluation

158
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,560
the second thing we wanted is that we

159
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,480
want device representation these devices

160
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,900
are extremely diverse you have things

161
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,160
that are that that run media and you

162
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,469
have a fridge and then you have a

163
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,570
connected oven so the all these devices

164
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,990
are very diverse and we wanted a

165
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:24,290
representative device set to actually

166
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,030
evaluate and finally since these are

167
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,600
consumer facing devices we want the

168
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,729
results to be easy to understand so

169
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,920
having that in mind this is a picture of

170
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,810
our lab we went out and bought a bunch

171
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,890
of devices and we start plugging them

172
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,140
and we thought it's gonna be an easy

173
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,740
task but it turned out to be non-trivial

174
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,750
actually just the other day I plugged in

175
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,490
a device and I heard an explosion in the

176
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,640
ceiling so I started thinking to myself

177
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,910
I need to change my name move to a

178
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,159
different state but we figured it out it

179
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:59,000
wasn't a big deal so we take these

180
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,350
devices and we evaluate every single one

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,500
of them so how does the evaluation

182
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:08,540
happen let's take an example for the IOT

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,450
evaluate a device what we look for are

184
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,970
four things we look at how does it pair

185
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,250
to the Internet how does it how is it

186
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,310
configured does it operate without

187
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,200
configuration is it up dateable can we

188
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,420
update it does it do automatic updates

189
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,659
or is it manual updates and then what

190
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,750
exposed services are on the network and

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,300
are any of them vulnerable so what we

192
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,200
found here for this device the Micasa

193
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:39,919
vera lights there were two remote code

194
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,190
execution that affected the UPnP service

195
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,010
and the SSH service on the device for

196
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,870
the cloud we look at what type of

197
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,900
backends and how many of backends does

198
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,140
it talk to the tls/ssl properties on the

199
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,550
cloud back-end so our is itself sign are

200
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,370
their name mismatches on the certificate

201
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,770
or is it an old version of the SSL TLS

202
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,540
protocol being supported and then any

203
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,100
insecure protocols that run on the

204
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,949
device and finally we look at again

205
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,030
software with any exposed services and

206
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:14,190
for this case the balcony net cam we

207
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,730
actually found that it talks to 12

208
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,590
different first party backends so this

209
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,100
is a single device talking 12 different

210
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,900
backends supports all their versions of

211
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,670
SSL and it had a remote code execution

212
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:31,170
on the logic back-end for the mobile app

213
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,300
we looked at three properties we looked

214
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,339
at permissions we looked at programming

215
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,589
errors and then we looked at hard-coded

216
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,590
secrets and what and for this case the

217
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,170
cou gig light bulb we found hard-coded

218
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,230
crypto keys and then of course the

219
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,870
analytics for uming API key hard-coded

220
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,020
into the mobile app and then for the I

221
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,170
for the network we looked at the

222
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,960
protocols in use what protocols can are

223
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:01,170
we seeing across the wire are these is

224
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,840
this communication encrypted and then if

225
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,319
it's encrypted

226
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:10,260
can we man in the middle of these

227
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,810
communications because they can do they

228
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,939
can make the encryption can be encrypted

229
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,400
but are they doing proper certificate

230
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,380
pinning so the the man in the middle

231
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,660
attacks won't work so these are

232
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,080
properties we looked for for each of the

233
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,140
devices and for the Sonos play:1 what we

234
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,390
found is that most of the traffic is

235
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,610
encrypted across the Internet but a lot

236
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,910
of the traffic within the local LAN is

237
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,470
unencrypted so what we did is we took

238
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,390
these evaluation remember the four

239
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,760
components we have the device the

240
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,939
network component the cloud component

241
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,400
and the mobile component and we created

242
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,150
a scorecard system that represents the

243
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,189
rates of these components to kind of get

244
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,319
an understanding of what what are what

245
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,110
what grades that each of them get and

246
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,490
we've documented this on our website so

247
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,380
if you need more information on how we

248
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,290
do the scoring you can please visit our

249
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,240
website so let's take an example of the

250
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,240
grading system so we we have this

251
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,170
component framework the the component

252
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,960
based the four parts we drop in the

253
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,219
device we evaluate it and then we

254
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,380
a we get a score for that device then we

255
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,230
take the mobile app we drop it in we

256
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,330
calculate the grade and we get a great

257
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,910
for that device similarly we do that for

258
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,570
the network and then we do that also for

259
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,319
the cloud components so what's

260
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,990
interesting here is the variation and

261
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,060
scores for each of the components you

262
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,480
can see a high score at the network

263
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,000
grade of almost 90% and a low score for

264
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,850
the cloud grade that almost 58 percent

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,590
and what's interesting too is that this

266
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,480
is a single device this is the Harman

267
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,020
Kardon invoke this is a single device

268
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,970
and this framework highlights this

269
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,130
component based analysis that shows the

270
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,250
different security issues that could

271
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,050
exist within this ecosystem

272
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,300
let's take multiple devices I want you

273
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,550
to look at this table you can see at the

274
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,630
cloud grade you have a large variation

275
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:18,660
from 94% 93 % all the way down to 40%

276
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,670
and then less variation on the device

277
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,589
and less variations on the mobile grade

278
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,709
but what's interesting about this case

279
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,260
is that this is the same manufacturer

280
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,450
this is a balcan device these are three

281
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,100
Belkin devices and you would think that

282
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,470
the Belkin has a process of building

283
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,630
these devices so you would see less

284
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,940
variation but we these are some things

285
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:43,350
that were surprised to find applying the

286
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,670
methodology and these this framework now

287
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,870
everything was good we actually were

288
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,750
surprised to find some really good

289
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:53,360
devices like this canary camera scored

290
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,830
really well on almost all categories so

291
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,530
applying this we found couple of

292
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,710
takeaways of things that good devices do

293
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:05,160
so devices that are usually score high

294
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:07,290
they're cloud managed they have auto

295
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,689
updates and they encrypt the local

296
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,219
traffic with authenticated services so

297
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,490
these these are just properties that

298
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:19,380
trended out of applying this methodology

299
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,970
and what's interesting too is that when

300
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,939
we looked at this component based

301
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,730
analysis is that it highlighted a lot of

302
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,610
different things that we we weren't

303
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,990
expecting

304
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,150
and I encourage everyone to also visit

305
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,750
our website because we have 45 devices

306
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,790
we've also added 70 our lab has now 70

307
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:40,030
devices that we'll be updating the

308
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,099
website soon with so I want to take a

309
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,870
step back here and just mention that

310
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,230
what you just saw is a single evaluation

311
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:50,950
or a single snapshot evaluation of these

312
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,140
devices what we want to do is look at a

313
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,840
longitudinal analysis and be able to see

314
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,260
how this analysis changes over time

315
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,510
these devices get updates and as updates

316
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,660
come along things can get worse could

317
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,020
get better see the easier publicized how

318
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,060
does that impact these components the

319
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,150
second thing here is we want a more

320
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:18,099
realistic representation the lab has

321
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:19,870
devices that have sensors which when

322
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,640
deployed in the lab it's different than

323
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,740
its deployed at home you have people

324
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,730
walking a foot traffic you have people

325
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,400
talking to these devices whereas in the

326
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,230
lab we need to induce that activity so

327
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,670
that's another thing that we we are

328
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,130
working on to improve so we can get a

329
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,979
better representational score of those

330
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:42,250
devices with that I've we've actually

331
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:45,100
opened our data set on our website so

332
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,890
you can go ahead and download there it's

333
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,780
come we know of several researchers who

334
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,630
actually have downloaded the data

335
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,010
already they've published paper on this

336
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,280
work some of them have gotten best paper

337
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,650
award so we're proud of that yeah and

338
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,959
and you can visit our website it's your

339
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,730
things that info and then if you have

340
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,340

341
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,420
this contact that your things that info

342
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,440
thank you

343
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,990
[Applause]

344
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,110
okay so we have time for a few questions

345
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:22,690
please state your name and affiliation

346
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,700
hi tatianna rhythm was an University did

347
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,210
you look at the correlation between cost

348
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:31,540
and security score I'm sorry I didn't

349
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,940
did you look at correlation between the

350
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,949
cost and the security level of a device

351
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:42,400
the cost of the device and the cigarette

352
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:46,210
we did not know hi Murphy I'm from UT

353
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,510
Arlington so I really you paper any in

354
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:53,050
your valuation you mainly focus on the

355
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:55,300
IP based protocols so did you do any

356
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,300
human uation on lower energy protocol

357
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,910
like a Duke Bo a babe or is there any

358
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,969
change you have we have we have looked

359
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,069
at lower low energy protocols the

360
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,650
challenge there is automating these to

361
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,690
be able to do the evaluation in a

362
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,180
systematic way so we we are we are

363
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,029
looking to explore that area further but

364
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:20,469
we don't have anything that's public

365
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:22,780
facing ready yeah okay so I also have a

366
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,760
few questions first how long does it

367
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,970
take to do such an evaluation because

368
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,910
fewer and the last 45 devices yes so we

369
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,960
we do evaluations on a weekly basis so

370
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:37,270
for the devices for the mobile apps it's

371
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,680
it's automated the network some of the

372
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,300
network portion requires some manual

373
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,790
like the man in the middle that we're

374
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:47,890
working on to automates but I would say

375
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:50,199
per device that for this work when we

376
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,699
did the evaluation I think per device it

377
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,209
would take about an hour and a half or

378
00:16:51,700 --> 00:17:00,370
so so 45 devices to took us some about a

379
00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:02,949
week work and how about privacy privacy

380
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,740
is another thing we look at so if you go

381
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,829
to the website the DNS for example the

382
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,569
DNS we consider privacy there and you

383
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,879
will see some devices actually will not

384
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,740
let you change the recursive the the

385
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,470
like for example the Google devices they

386
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,670
use the eight eight eight eight

387
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,319
recursive and and you cannot change it

388
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,740
they don't respect even if you change it

389
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,599
and you tell it to use your gateways DNS

390
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,760
they will not they will actually

391
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,290
yeah reach directly out so that's that's

392
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,310
one of the things we penalize for in

393
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:35,350
terms of privacy in our evaluation okay

394
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,320
so thank you and let's think oh ma again

395
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,480
thank you

396
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,480
[Applause]
