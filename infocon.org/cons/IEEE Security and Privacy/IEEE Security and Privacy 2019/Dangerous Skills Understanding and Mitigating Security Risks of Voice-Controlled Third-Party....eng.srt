1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,430
thank you for the for professor

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,189
introduction hi everyone I'm Jeremy from

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,009
Indiana University today I will present

4
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:27,259
our work on what's asserting the

5
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:28,910
platform's so university years was

6
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:31,789
assist in the devices are getting very

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:36,199
popular especially MC echo devices and

8
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:37,670
Google home devices using two devices

9
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:40,519
you can do a lot of with different

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:43,879
scents such as a to play music to

11
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:45,820
control your smart home devices or to

12
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,199
send out the same money using PayPal

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,710
actually you can also even to access

14
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,449
your medical information so you know

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,079
study were able to also this question

16
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:59,149
are they smart enough to be security and

17
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,449
input if the answer is yes such as

18
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:06,979
Caucasian work so I'm also is not yet so

19
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,560
we are you introduced to your horses of

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,360
platforms work and the will define

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,750
security requirements that we need to be

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,729
satisfied and what we also identified

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,429
the security caps that were related to

24
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:23,959
some attack scenarios including West

25
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:26,330
squaring and also was masquerading well

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:29,360
as I discussed the potential consequence

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,590
consequences also to attacks and also

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,270
evaluate a hospitable as other attacks

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,789
lastly we are present you our different

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,959
solutions including the skills response

31
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:45,800
checker and a user intention class file

32
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:48,979
so how it works from Haleiwa it works

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,220
like an ethical rider the capture users

34
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,619
was command decided the specific skill

35
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,050
to handle once the response is a

36
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:00,800
willable from the skill it will be

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,319
belabor the reversely to the users so as

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,000
we all know network writing system has

39
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:07,360
been proved a very efficient and

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,669
reliable in the past the tens of years

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,349
while there are some attacks such as BGP

42
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:18,140
hiding IP GB hijacking mostly is very

43
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,048
reliable so if you consider was a

44
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,000
session a platform as a black box it

45
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:25,860
actually work working a similar manner

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,670
it'll capture the use of Westmount and

47
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,810
the deliver it forwarded to the specific

48
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,380
scale to handle

49
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,260
so basically they're said job is to

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,350
release the sauce pollute to the correct

51
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:45,209
destination so how can they achieve this

52
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:47,519
goal URI first us the destination to the

53
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,150
how its address and address should be

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,640
unique also the traffic should included

55
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,940
the destination address as part of the

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,190
payload so also the writing system

57
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,040
should be able to accurately retrieve

58
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,989
the destination address from the traffic

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,299
and the u.s. there are some conflicts

60
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:10,380
there should be some strategy to resolve

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,920
it so is this the case for the West says

62
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,620
in the platform's firstly you just

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,440
secure actually had well we'll need to

64
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,140
register a you occasion name which we

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,859
can which can be regarded as a dress or

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,140
identifier however election actually

67
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,110
allows skills to have similar occasion

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,260
names while this is known not allowed on

69
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,930
Google platform secured can still have

70
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,090
occasional said share similar or using

71
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,930
the same pronunciation which we are

72
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,870
resulting in the same problem also human

73
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,600
the users are not machines

74
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,829
we prefer to use Thai words and the

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,480
natural languages style to yuka skills

76
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:57,450
whether whether their education manner

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,760
can include the imitation name

78
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,828
accurately it a deserved further

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,980
investigation

80
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:10,350
also as we studied our systems we also

81
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,290
to retrieve the invocation name farmer

82
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,150
uses was commander so basically the

83
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,589
worst commander will be converted from

84
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,019
speech to text 10 NLP techniques will be

85
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:25,280
used to retrieve the invocation name as

86
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,870
we all know air systems are always

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,859
complicated and as they can be error

88
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,270
prone so this also deserved for the

89
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,890
study to understand the whole wheels

90
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,539
they can recognize the use of the words

91
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,789
command where well

92
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,720
lastly we found that the longest a

93
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,910
perfect matching is also near first

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,410
universities and platforms but the

95
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,770
context is different the firm's and

96
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,470
network writing also the address format

97
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,940
is different so this strategy actually

98
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,890
caused some extra problems your study we

99
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,800
have captured we have identified two

100
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,200
attack scenarios when it was grading and

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,970
we found it so platforms may fail to

102
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,620
understand the use of the intentions and

103
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,950
is therefore you woke us the wrong

104
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,890
skills for users serrata is the worst

105
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,080
masquerading and the because you're

106
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,030
switching and determination is not well

107
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,000
supported

108
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:25,539
so take actually masquerading itself as

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,230
other skills are using the system so

110
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:32,050
what's the consequences of those attacks

111
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:34,110
for what squirting so number one is the

112
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,240
compromiser uses data on a device

113
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,460
depending on different the skill the

114
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,740
data or device can be different it can

115
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,299
be the bank account balance or your

116
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:50,170
historical transfer records it can also

117
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,050
be the access to your home device also

118
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,240
so secure me the attacker might be able

119
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,400
to propagate a figure out controversial

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,750
information start depending on different

121
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:05,669
skill such as a some fake news or some

122
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,880
wrong wrong medical results

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,220
besides so attacker can actually direct

124
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,100
the users to some traditional by the

125
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,990
powerful fishing channels because they

126
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,950
can send the user notification

127
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,380
cars where they can include some website

128
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,870
and the customer service phone number

129
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,330
and Oscar users who visited to the

130
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,920
website and phone number therefore T

131
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,700
where T reactor users to some

132
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,790
traditional fishing channels

133
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,590
besides because the users don't know

134
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,200
they are communicating with the wrong

135
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,619
skills they may had a very bad

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,719
experience and if they were go ahead at

137
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,820
okay where battery will was a weak team

138
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,640
skill which we are definitely

139
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,140
the reputation of the victim skill so

140
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,690
what the consequences that was

141
00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:01,719
masquerading it where allah so takers to

142
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,580
Massacre it itself as a other skills the

143
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,790
consequences which should be different

144
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,710
should be the same as it was squatting

145
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,800
also it allows the attacker to

146
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,530
masquerade masquerade itself as the

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,400
system which allows the attacker to

148
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:21,309
record the users conversations and and

149
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,239
also suggest some other malicious skill

150
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,800
to the users so how realistic how

151
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,070
realistic are those attacks to start we

152
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,690
study how users you know skills to

153
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:39,090
understand where user accurately

154
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,700
included the new location name in their

155
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,289
human kitchen was command besides how

156
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,930
whales are played from the kind

157
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,660
understand ur can recognize southwest

158
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,880
command which that was the knowledge

159
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,090
learned from the first two steps we

160
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,990
compose the settable attack skills at

161
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,210
experimenting whether they will get

162
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,810
started instead it was a whip team skill

163
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:06,039
we also scan the host kill market to see

164
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:10,330
is earning real-world attacker cases to

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,490
start yeah we use such a you I will use

166
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,849
a study we can use her to invocation

167
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,610
names and a schism which which is their

168
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,830
preferred Yuma kitchen manners semi

169
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,830
selectors are answers we provided with

170
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,070
them they may also fail in their own

171
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:30,580
answers with with our open questions he

172
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:34,059
table shows the top your kitchen manners

173
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,909
preferred by users and we can see when

174
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,890
you're working skills you suspend to use

175
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:43,750
word tie words and the natural language

176
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:46,630
you know kitchen miners as with as

177
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,410
affirmation longest prefix matching is

178
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,850
you know foster you know splat from

179
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,650
considering users Thai words and the

180
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,410
natural language invocation manners even

181
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,910
work read some attack space for Wisc

182
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,770
wedding which has been proven our later

183
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,870
experiment so we

184
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,720
study how well the system can understand

185
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,270
the use of Westmount

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,839
so we start to select a 1/100 the you

187
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,420
know kitchen names for each platform and

188
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,560
we then recorded the West command

189
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:22,990
through human subjects and the

190
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:25,719
text-to-speech services with a place of

191
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,540
the recordings to the platforms and our

192
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,320
help skill where capture the recognition

193
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:36,160
results from the platforms I'll show you

194
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,300
this table the recognition error rate is

195
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,910
actually wear high while Google looks

196
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,279
much better but a pimple center is just

197
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,600
too high for to create a bigger attack

198
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:52,899
space for example Florida State quiz

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,560
will be recognized as Florida snake quiz

200
00:09:52,899 --> 00:10:00,790
under Renta Europe where beam is

201
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,469
recognized as a reader Europe so based

202
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,829
on the knowledge learned from last two

203
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,450
steps with composure text girls and

204
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,260
experimental weather our attack skill

205
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:14,200
we're getting worked instead it was a

206
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,410
instead of the victim skill so we can

207
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,300
post girl from to Tino's when it's based

208
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,339
on knowledge learned from the useless

209
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:27,760
user study we added some prefix or

210
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,770
suffixes to the location name so as a

211
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,250
channel is through similar pronunciation

212
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:38,380
has learned from the Supriya see study

213
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:41,470
previous evaluation we actually composed

214
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,570
some skills compose communication names

215
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:48,279
that had similar pronunciation as a wick

216
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,899
team skill once in who knows note within

217
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,050
and publish our attack skill to the

218
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:56,890
market so yah Yahoo experiment

219
00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:00,729
Tommy users will not be affected here

220
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:03,730
shows the result so table shows how many

221
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,029
attack skills getting in worked instead

222
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:10,089
of in standing over the victim skill

223
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:14,020
while is different from fun platforms

224
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:15,829
but basically our attack skills are very

225
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,170
likely to getting in worked

226
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:23,929
instead it was a victim skill is

227
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:26,059
especially on on the Alexa platform so

228
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:31,579
the next step is to identify real-world

229
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:34,189
attack cases so the general goal is to

230
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,679
identify skills with computing occasion

231
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:38,569
name we define computing invocation name

232
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:40,549
as as name cetera

233
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,799
either how similar pronunciation or

234
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:47,179
level reaches along is the prefix

235
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:49,970
matching strategy so we first collect a

236
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:52,009
willabus skills from post-market because

237
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,739
for some tech for some technical

238
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:57,139
difficulties within a identify a lot of

239
00:11:54,739 --> 00:12:00,499
skills fall from google google marketer

240
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:04,850
so we focus on our study on the election

241
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:08,259
market we then came up with a workflow

242
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,999
to generate the computing location names

243
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:15,350
through which we can identify computing

244
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:17,779
skills on the market here shows a

245
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,990
workflow to generate those computing

246
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:23,929
acacia names for cam limit I will not go

247
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,619
into details basically as you can see we

248
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:30,019
first applied text per freezing for the

249
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:34,129
giving invocation name and we thank

250
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:37,279
compare converted to text was commander

251
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:40,040
Yoon who is pronunciation format we then

252
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,230
compare the the pronunciation similarity

253
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,939
which allowed us to generate the

254
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,939
computing occasion new occasion names

255
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:51,410
here shows the results more than

256
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,480
nineteen percent the skills are

257
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,559
computing with each other because they

258
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,009
have a same pronunciation even we lower

259
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,439
as a bar to some to some level such as a

260
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:08,779
similar pronunciation the presence will

261
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:11,329
be in higher also 2.7% of skills health

262
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:15,230
sim pronunciations but a different smell

263
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:19,429
deepness spelling in their text firm and

264
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:22,040
another 1.8% skills actually leverages

265
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:25,189
that the longest prefix matching to

266
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,829
compete with some victim skills here

267
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:31,680
show some examples dogfight

268
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:36,000
effect is a human name were very popular

269
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,089
skill and here he is actually another

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,390
secure name the mere dog fact it

271
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:45,420
actually completed with the toxic dog

272
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,850
factor skill also there are other skills

273
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,400
see registered a new machine name that

274
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,340
are not relevant to tear secure content

275
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,250
or secure function but simply to compete

276
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,370
with some web popular skill such as

277
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,550
Cooper drawing that we and this soccer

278
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:05,370
chick here they're functioning is not a

279
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:09,479
relevant to space Jake but they register

280
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:12,360
space Jake as a new location name but

281
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:18,630
space Jake is a also the invocation name

282
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:21,450
aware were popular skill so our previous

283
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,880
workflow to generator computing

284
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,470
invocation name can help us to mitigate

285
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:31,530
or was quieting attack so here use a

286
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:35,880
different part when focused on mitigated

287
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:38,819
the West West masquerading attack our

288
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,250
defense included two parts why is the

289
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,790
user intention classifier it were decide

290
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,980
whether the user aims to conduct our

291
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,160
contact switching or simply want to

292
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,310
continue the current interaction so as

293
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,480
the party is a secure response checker

294
00:14:52,310 --> 00:15:00,079
it will decide whether whether the given

295
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,180
secure response is suspicious or not

296
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,180
here shows the methodology our use using

297
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,979
intention classifier still for time

298
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,920
limit our not to go into details

299
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,020
basically we compare the given users was

300
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,329
commanded to the contacts I would

301
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,150
current a scale to decide whether they

302
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,970
are highly relevant if not we consider

303
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:25,199
it so user 1 contains

304
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:27,360
to do a context switching our secure

305
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,200
response checker adopted a blacklist a

306
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,750
manner and for you to secure response we

307
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,570
were compared it to the items in the

308
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:40,320
blacklist you for high similarity search

309
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:42,630
is achieved will flatter this secure

310
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,870
response as suspicious

311
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:49,510
so to summary to attack scenario were

312
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:53,260
identified in our research was squirting

313
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:55,900
and was masquerading also post attacks

314
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,240
were found to be very practical and also

315
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,510
dangerous can causing a lot of different

316
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,820
consequences we also explored a

317
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,279
settlement medication solution such as a

318
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,980
completely new occasion a new generator

319
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:12,880
the using intention classifier and also

320
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,400
secure response checker one thing to

321
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,250
note is that both platform have have

322
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,829
acknowledged our attacker cases and also

323
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,150
discuss emetic mitigation solutions

324
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,270
through setting a set of meetings thank

325
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,270
you

326
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,900
[Applause]

327
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:41,710
okay we have time for few questions and

328
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:44,410
let me begin can you please explain the

329
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:48,450
attacks threat a bit more so to any to

330
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:51,339
install skills first or yeah actually

331
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,670
they are different from mobile apps who

332
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:58,720
you Yokosuka you don't need to install

333
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,790
it basically almost all skills that are

334
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,000
willable in the marketer can be invoked

335
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:06,760
by the user

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,010
okay so without any user so basically I

337
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,069
just pronounced or I just talk to my

338
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,780
device and then the device sends this to

339
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:18,220
the market and the market will then pick

340
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:21,609
one skill that fits yet aware send it to

341
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:26,020
the weather city assist in the cloud the

342
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:28,678
cloud we are the conductor longest a

343
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,200
perfect matching to decide which secure

344
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:35,559
where we worked so the secure server

345
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,170
will then take over the interaction with

346
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:40,300
the users after that all the West

347
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,929
command will be ascended to the secure

348
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:47,440
was yeah and then they were quite a few

349
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:49,570
differences between Google and Alexa to

350
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,720
have any explanation why the differences

351
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,500
were so

352
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,960
you mean the success rate

353
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,290
we actually not sure we use the same

354
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,980
root recordings I mean from text to

355
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:07,260
speech services and also human subjects

356
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,169
one thing to note it's a human subjects

357
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,070
MOOC almost all the human subjects are

358
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:16,440
native speakers so I don't want to

359
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:20,280
comment on why their performance is

360
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,220
different but yes that's it they just

361
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,879
show different recognition error rate

362
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,230
yeah okay thank you okay thanks

363
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,230
I just think the speaker again
