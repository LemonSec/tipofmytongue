168
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,089
with Twitter use the hashtag SP 19 and

169
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:31,680
send things at I triple ESP will retweet

170
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:34,000
them and let's keep this kind of

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,219
extended into cyberspace so that people

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,139
who couldn't make it know how awesome

173
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,889
this is and can be extremely jealous of

174
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,320
what we're enjoying

175
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:45,330
especially photographed food everyone

176
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:48,670
food pictures some notes from the hotel

177
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,109
after our plenary sessions many of them

178
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,330
are going to transition the room into

179
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,210
two so like a that the break here will

180
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,859
be transitioning into two sessions to

181
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,580
get our dual track so we can feature

182
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:03,280
this giant program the room transition

183
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,419
might encounter a hotel staff asking you

184
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,429
if you could kind of get out of the way

185
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,180
as they transition in the room don't

186
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,350
take offense

187
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,940
they're just trying to get you back in

188
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,090
session as quickly as possible so you

189
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,120
might be asked to move seating in each

190
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,330
of the two rooms is maximized for this

191
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,130
setup so we can't bring in more chairs

192
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,810
and we can't move chairs from room to

193
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,480
room so we have to help each other out

194
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,940
as a community take your bags off chairs

195
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,130
help people identify where their open

196
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,810
seats do not be afraid to walk to the

197
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,880
front of the room to get an open seat if

198
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,010
the session has already begun we have to

199
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,140
kind of help each other out to maximize

200
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,750
the use of both rooms because it might

201
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,220
be tight you have huge attendance and

202
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,540
some sessions might be more popular than

203
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:48,550
others also just as a note a couple

204
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,230
inches outside the glass that way is

205
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,790
downtown San Francisco we are

206
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,410
essentially on the street level of

207
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,569
downtown San Francisco we are in an

208
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,030
unsecured public space where people can

209
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,130
wander in from the street and do the

210
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,990
nature of this being a popular venue for

211
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,130
conferences this is a target of

212
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,990
professional thieves who dress like

213
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,390
conference goers and steal laptops and

214
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,980
cell phones be aware of your things this

215
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,560
isn't a problem that can be fixed by

216
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,550
security they look just like us don't

217
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,859
leave your things unattended have a

218
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,319
friend watch them secure them away and

219
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,770
take them with you and also the same

220
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,870
with at meals we've asked the hotel Dole

221
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,460
check for badges so you might be asked

222
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,500
to show your badge before you get into

223
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,180
breakfast or a meal please don't take

224
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,510
offense they've been asked to do this

225
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,040
it's a way to preserve the part of the

226
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:41,370
most expensive part of your registration

227
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:44,130
fee the food and beverage also a

228
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,780
correction our program has a misprint

229
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,820
many of our papers went through ethical

230
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,380
disclosure processes and we're embargoed

231
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,490
for a period of time so the online

232
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,189
program just had titles redacted

233
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,809
we unredacted them as of last night and

234
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:59,368
so the titles appeared all of the

235
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:02,490
unredacted titles are in your printed

236
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:05,399
program but sadly these two papers had a

237
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,339
typo in our printed program we mixed up

238
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,480
the titles so big apology to the authors

239
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:17,369
that like the lbm paper is in session 11

240
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,899
and is not in session 1 I apologize the

241
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:22,439
author's that we mixed up their paper

242
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,689
titles and as a final reminder the code

243
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,248
of conduct that we enacted last year to

244
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:28,469
make sure that this is a professional

245
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:31,170
and enjoyable environment for all of our

246
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,209
conference attendees is kind of we're

247
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,748
maturing our policies to meet our values

248
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,459
this year you'll notice attendees who

249
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:40,079
have a white ribbon that says code

250
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,439
steward we have a number of volunteers

251
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,079
who are acting this year to help us with

252
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:47,939
our code of conduct violations so if you

253
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,339
see something that you perceive to be a

254
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:52,290
code of conduct violation you can call

255
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,240
that number it'll reach all of our code

256
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,129
stewards or you can go to the

257
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,470
registration desk and ask to contact a

258
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:00,779
code steward and that person will help

259
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,029
out take a report try to mediate and

260
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,860
help enforce our code conference code of

261
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,230
conduct as we go to a multitrack this is

262
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,209
more than a one-person job so I'm

263
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,559
extremely grateful to our code stewards

00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,969
