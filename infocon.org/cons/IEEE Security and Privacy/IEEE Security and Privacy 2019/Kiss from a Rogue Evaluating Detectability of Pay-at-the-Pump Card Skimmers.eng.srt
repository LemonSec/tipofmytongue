1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,949
Thanks I promise

2
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,049
the only seal pun in this slide deck so

3
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm excited to be here again today to

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,300
talk to you about our work on detecting

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,099
card skimmers and specifically on what

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,230
options are available to us as consumers

7
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:30,149
to be able to detect these devices

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:35,519
excuse me to detect these devices so if

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:39,750
you recall clicker clicker is not

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:46,950
working oh yeah let's see that's right

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:48,510
again there we go okay so if you're

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,690
crawled from our use next security paper

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,809
in August we we developed this taxonomy

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,970
of skimmers which are malicious embedded

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:01,170
devices that are designed a copy and an

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,059
acquire payment card data we developed

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,909
this with the with the NYPD and in that

18
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,560
paper we tackled the problem of overlay

19
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,210
and deep insert skimmers these have

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,500
additional magnetic read heads and we

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,009
can use some properties of those to

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,079
detect those but for this talk I'm going

23
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,280
to talk to you about internal and gas

24
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,559
pump skimmers and these are

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,499
predominantly installed inside the pumps

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,240
themselves and the attack is actually

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,189
pretty simple so what attackers do is

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,589
they'll pull up something like a box

29
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,389
truck or u-haul or something large to a

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,229
gas pump to obscure the view of the

31
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:36,329
attendant they'll unlock the pump many

32
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,219
of these pumps we've found actually have

33
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,719
pore locks or the locks are actually not

34
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,068
changed when they're installed so the

35
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,009
attackers actually just drive around

36
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,719
with a set of master keys and unlock the

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,969
pumps in fact while we were out with

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,609
while we were out with detectives one of

39
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:53,339
the detectives actually used his office

40
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:56,639
file cabinet key to unlock and open a

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,810
gas pump and then once they're inside

42
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,789
you know it's pretty simple they just

43
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,829
disconnect cables that are in there they

44
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,469
connect the skimmer and then and then

45
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,079
close it back up now you might be

46
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,280
wondering don't we have technology that

47
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,079
that should that should solve this

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,670
problem and of course you know there is

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,430
technology out there that makes this

50
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,290
better but deploying it is actually

51
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,300
pretty hard and in fact I've never

52
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,519
actually used the chip on my credit card

53
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,390
to buy gas and and I doubt many of you

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,280
have either and and

55
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,899
visa and mastercard and and the credit

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
card companies they understand this and

57
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,709
so they keep pushing back the the

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,260
deadline for installing these but the

59
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,690
rehab for installing these uh these new

60
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,730
payment systems but the reason for that

61
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,430
may actually surprise you it turns out

62
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,560
that it actually costs six to ten

63
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,230
thousand dollars per pump to replace the

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,760
payment hardware and that's because it

65
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,488
has to be special hardware has to be

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,959
installed by licensed technicians you

67
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:55,130
know obviously we don't want gas pumps

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,989
to explode and in fact we found since

69
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,640
this we found that this is actually a

70
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,230
really conservative estimate many of

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,640
these gas pumps are too old to have the

72
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,510
payment Hardware upgraded and can cost

73
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,420
up to twice as much as this now this is

74
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,310
a multi hundred million dollar problem

75
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,929
but per store there's only about seven

76
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,640
hundred dollars worth of fraud on

77
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,500
average per store and that means that if

78
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,450
you're a small business and you need to

79
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,980
replace this payment hardware and you

80
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,459
have six pumps it could take you your

81
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,890
entire lifetime to recoup the cost of

82
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,870
deploying this payment hardware and so

83
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,488
it's there's no wonder that this market

84
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,530
doesn't want to deploy this new hardware

85
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,019
and so you might be curious if they even

86
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,670
care and it turns out that they do care

87
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,150
and we know that because it says so

88
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,190
right here on the on the seal now gas

89
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,900
pump out upgrades like I said her costly

90
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,920
so merchants started to use these seals

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,350
and they're intended to make the

92
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,750
consumer aware of if there's a problem

93
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,220
with the integrity of the pump and I

94
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,680
want you to note how it instructs a

95
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,810
consumer to report a problem now

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,959
merchants implicitly ask us to perform

97
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,690
this check for every transaction now

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
we've beaten browser security interfaces

99
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,590
to death and we've made this better and

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,630
this is effectively an embedded system

101
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,519
to security interface but unlike browser

102
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,620
interfaces where they're only you know

103
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,049
three or four major players these seals

104
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,200
come in hundreds of sizes colors and

105
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,789
brands and furthermore research shows

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,620
that these seals are easily defeated

107
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,880
especially in voting security but we

108
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,880
wanted to know if they're effective in

109
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,860
the real world now there are a lot of

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,260
things that have to go right for you to

111
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,120
be able to evaluate one of these seals

112
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,950
as a consumer you need to know you know

113
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,780
should a seal be present at all is the

114
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,030
seal place correctly what's the purpose

115
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,529
of the seal in fact you might look at

116
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,748
this picture and think that

117
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:42,079
gas pump is being held together by these

118
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:45,139
seals rather than providing any kind of

119
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,119
security property and you need to know

120
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,219
if this is the correct seal so for

121
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:52,489
example this is a picture of an Exxon

122
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:54,979
pump with Exxon seals on it but in

123
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:57,979
Orlando for example many of the gas

124
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,449
stations use Orlando municipal seals so

125
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,159
if you're not aware of what kind of

126
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,929
seals should be present that can be a

127
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,789
problem as well and then finally if all

128
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:06,768
of those things go right you need to be

129
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:09,169
able to know does the seal indicate

130
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:11,389
tampering and it's not really clear to

131
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,159
us that consumers are are equipped to

132
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,079
evaluate these seals so we sought out

133
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:20,299
data about whether these work in

134
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:22,309
practice so we obtained some data from

135
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:24,169
the Florida Department of Agriculture

136
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:26,179
and Consumer Services who records data

137
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,359
about skimmers at gas pumps these guys

138
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:30,919
actually go out they open pumps they

139
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,529
have a legal right to open pumps and

140
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,399
inspect for skimmers and they recorded

141
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:38,269
this data over over over three years and

142
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,069
that makes this one of the most

143
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:43,279
comprehensive data sets available for

144
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,229
skimming attacks in the world now this

145
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,689
data contains a lot and this data

146
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,429
contains open response fields about the

147
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,409
state of the pumps at the time that the

148
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:53,628
skimmers were found which can tell us a

149
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:57,199
lot about whether or not any security

150
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:59,539
measures were present so we had two

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,519
researchers code these fields there were

152
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:05,029
about 1200 annotations and we found

153
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:07,969
roughly 30 unique themes our Cohen's

154
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:10,308
kappa over these 30 codes was 0.94 which

155
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:12,829
is almost perfect agreement actually

156
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:14,539
before I move on I want to note that the

157
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:16,939
seal on this gas pumps actually

158
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:18,619
installed on the hinge so that when you

159
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:24,199
open the gas pump it won't actually

160
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:26,899
break the seal so over an order of

161
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,599
magnitude more pumps have intact seals

162
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,699
when skimmers are found than any other

163
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,099
problem including Brooklyn or

164
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,899
incorrectly placed seals and our law

165
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,209
enforcement contacts tell us that there

166
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,369
are two main reasons for this attackers

167
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,469
simply replace the seals after they

168
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:44,089
install the skimmers or employees

169
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,558
actually fail to check for skimmers

170
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:47,960
before reapplying a seal we were

171
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:51,050
actually out at a gas station

172
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,219
I'm with detectives we found a gas pump

173
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,810
that didn't have a seal and we went

174
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,340
inside and said hey you just wanted to

175
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,830
tell you that you know pump two doesn't

176
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,258
have a seal on it and the attendant I

177
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,539
grabbed a roll of seals from under the

178
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,360
desk went out put one on and then went

179
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:08,270
back to work

180
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,610
so so what's wrong so these seals

181
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,219
require consistent placement in visuals

182
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,870
and and this is a this is a classic time

183
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,250
of check to time abuse vulnerability the

184
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,500
seals ideally should be placed

185
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,000
immediately after they're inspected but

186
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,430
these results suggests that either the

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
inspection fails or the seal is placed

188
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,139
after the skimmer is installed in fact

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,560
you can you - for $69 for a carton of

190
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:34,030
500 I can buy your own buy your own role

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,699
of we care official security seals and

192
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,919
so many skimmers though are built to

193
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,199
allow attackers to retrieve card data

194
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,639
wirelessly and it's less risky for them

195
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,789
so what can we do about our what do we

196
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,880
have in regards of technical detection

197
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,949
methods has actually been a number of

198
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,949
apps that have come out over the last

199
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:57,320
few years to combat this specific

200
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,599
problem and we got all of them we could

201
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,669
find there were five Android and two iOS

202
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,199
apps and so what we did was a

203
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,659
comprehensive teardown of each of these

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,090
apps to identify the detection

205
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,880
mechanisms that these apps use to

206
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,940
actually identify skimmers now those of

207
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,010
you that have done this before Android

208
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:20,090
apps are a lot more straightforward to

209
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:22,099
analyze dalvik bytecode and xamarin

210
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,750
c-sharp apps decompile pretty well into

211
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,969
readable source code like the skin plus

212
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,169
app that's shown here but iOS apps are

213
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,909
more difficult you know you have to

214
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,258
jailbreak a device to decrypt the app

215
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,208
and then you have to step through the

216
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,029
application to figure out what it's

217
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:37,039
doing but without further ado we'll get

218
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:41,510
to the we'll get to the meat of how

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,300
these apps work so the first app checks

220
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,670
scans for Bluetooth devices if it finds

221
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,920
something with a particular name I will

222
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,649
try to pair with the device then it will

223
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,899
send a creative serial sockets and a

224
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,150
single byte if it gets us this specific

225
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:58,430
single byte back then it will tell you

226
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,560
that a skimmer is present only if all of

227
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,569
these things only if all of these things

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,910
have

229
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,800
now the second app is exactly the same

230
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,250
but it has another and it has another

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,399
name so if the device is name is H Co 5

232
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:18,230
or H C of 0 6 then it will then it will

233
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:20,899
alert the third app skim + is actually

234
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,880
pretty interesting so this this app

235
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,589
alerts if any Bluetooth devices MAC

236
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,230
address and range begins with one of the

237
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,449
following prefixes now these other UIs

238
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,610
are assigned to generally assigned to

239
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:33,139
standard module manufacturers but what

240
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,910
was most interesting to us was use of

241
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,070
two zero one six two zero one seven

242
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,660
these look like years because they're

243
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,620
not complete oh you is they're only 2

244
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:47,089
bytes now the the 2016 block actually

245
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:49,850
had companies like Intel and light on

246
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,769
and the 2017 block actually had no

247
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,720
assignments and this indicates to us

248
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,550
that there's some module manufacturer

249
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,529
out there either selecting non-standard

250
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,060
mac addressing or their spoof you know

251
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:04,459
they're they're setting these MAC

252
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,890
addresses post manufacturing but the

253
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,329
idea here is is pretty simple we're

254
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,010
gonna look for these MAC addresses and

255
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:11,839
of course this is going to detect many

256
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,610
more legitimate devices than skimmers

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,430
especially from companies well-known

258
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,370
companies like Intel and light on now

259
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,890
the next step I'll show you this so this

260
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,949
is a this is an Apache Cordova app so

261
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,600
this is this is JavaScript now when you

262
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,430
click the button either this app has a

263
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,779
button it says scan for skimmers and so

264
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,089
this is what happens when you press that

265
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:37,339
button so the first thing it does is it

266
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,779
shows you an ad okay the next thing it

267
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:42,130
does is it shows you a list of Bluetooth

268
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:45,769
serial devices that are in range and

269
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,500
then finally finally it gives you a

270
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:50,360
notification I apologize for my

271
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,579
apologize if I have a hard time reading

272
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,279
this but it says no skimmer found this

273
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,969
scan not found any device used skimmer

274
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,689
hard weird

275
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,449
please behind some device skimmer but

276
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,069
ultimately what this thing does is it

277
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,170
shows you a list of apps that are in

278
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,540
range and then tells you that nothing

279
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,140
was found after showing you that and a

280
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,519
hat of course so

281
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,220
the remaining act the remaining apps

282
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,750
can't detect skimmers is all actually

283
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,070
two of the Android apps to show you an

284
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,910
ad and then tell you that there were no

285
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,410
skimmers found one iOS app displays

286
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,689
skimmer locations on a map that are

287
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,939
crowd-sourced but has no results and the

288
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,910
other iOS app alerts on any ble device

289
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,769
with a long name now interestingly when

290
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,420
we were working with law enforcement

291
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,610
we've never seen a skimmer that uses

292
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,260
Bluetooth Low Energy and in fact it

293
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,240
actually turns out that iOS doesn't

294
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,279
allow apps to scan for Bluetooth classic

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,829
devices so it's not even possible to

296
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:50,670
build an iOS app that detects the

297
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:53,040
majority of skimmers okay so these these

298
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,069
detection mechanisms seem brittle so how

299
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,990
do they stand up to real skimmers so we

300
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,399
got six internal skimmers from law

301
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,860
enforcement and we did a teardown on

302
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,660
each of these and then we evaluated

303
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,459
whether these detection apps would

304
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,709
actually detect these skimmers so we

305
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,089
powered up each of these skimmers we ran

306
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,750
each of the apps to see what would

307
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:15,720
happen now two skimmers were detected by

308
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,600
all three of the apps that actually that

309
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,130
actually can detect skimmers and the

310
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,570
remaining skimmers either use different

311
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,970
Bluetooth modules if they don't use

312
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,709
bluetooth at all in fact one of them

313
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,690
requires the attacker to come back and

314
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:30,209
actually plug it up with USB to get the

315
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,220
data off and another one actually just

316
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,899
texts the attacker the credit card

317
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,089
information in real time so they don't

318
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,300
actually have to come back to the gas

319
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:41,010
station now it turns out that these

320
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,410
skimmers are configurable using the

321
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,120
using the serial interface they require

322
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,189
that you turn on a configuration mode on

323
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,480
the board but then you can send it these

324
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,160
80 commands to do the reconfiguration

325
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,110
now using these we change the name and

326
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,060
the pin and we retested the skimmers now

327
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,070
we knew from our code analysis what to

328
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,109
expect this allowed us to confirm our

329
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,269
findings and frankly it was easier to

330
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,589
reconfigure these than we expected well

331
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,550
within the range of an attackers

332
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,680
capabilities and so the skin plus app

333
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,300
that does this prefix matching for MAC

334
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,290
addresses

335
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,449
detects two of the six skimmers

336
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,640
regardless of their configuration and of

337
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:20,219
course we're concerned about the the

338
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,720
false positives that this invites now if

339
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,670
you're an attacker and you want to avoid

340
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,380
this app you have a few options you

341
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,140
could not use Bluetooth at all

342
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,820
you could use a different module or you

343
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,740
could spoof the MAC address and of

344
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,000
course we know from our data set that

345
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,000
two of these are already happening

346
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,520
so should we abandon all hope

347
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,620
asking consumers to check for these

348
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,810
skimmers is simply not gonna work so

349
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,300
first of all what's available to us as

350
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:51,209
consumers with regard to seals these

351
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,579
seals are are inconsistent they're hard

352
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,850
to read they require you to to give it

353
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,350
your full attention and the internal

354
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,570
skimmers themselves they're easily

355
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,460
installed and they leave no consistent

356
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,050
universal wireless trace and some of

357
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,110
these don't have wireless capabilities

358
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,990
at all so what should we do well we

359
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,880
should change the locks on these gas

360
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,090
pumps to make it harder to get into it I

361
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,320
mean building a perimeter around your

362
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,250
system is one of the first things we

363
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,410
talked about in insecurity and we should

364
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,140
also take we can take we can take a

365
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,480
lesson from pin pads where you use to

366
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,860
you know sign your name on you know when

367
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,040
you go to a grocery store many of these

368
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,660
when you open them up they disable so

369
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,089
you can disable the terminal when the

370
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,219
door opens and finally if we have to use

371
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,570
these seals we know research in our

372
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,220
community especially about browser

373
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,870
security warnings that the best way to

374
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,120
get a user to be aware of a potential

375
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,220
problem is to interrupt the workflow you

376
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,780
know take the screen that you have point

377
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,220
to where it should be show them what it

378
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,640
should look like say does it look like

379
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,500
this

380
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:57,510
and what do these things do they force

381
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,400
attackers to use external skimmers if we

382
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,230
can deny them the ability to get into

383
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,420
the gas pumps they'll stick the skimmers

384
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,460
on the outside and we've and our work

385
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,849
has already shown that these kinds of

386
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,350
skimmers are very detectable and finally

387
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,750
just a note about impact you know this

388
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,930
work is being used by Florida lawmakers

389
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,090
in consideration of making changes to

390
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,469
require better locks instead of these

391
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,640
security seals so we're hopeful that

392
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,580
this is going to have some long-term

393
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,600
impact and with that I'm happy to take

394
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,600
any questions you have

395
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,480
awesome you've got plenty of time for

396
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,950
questions

397
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,950
let me kick it off how do I get into the

398
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,890
business of selling hardware for four

399
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,480
pumps that's a that's a great question

400
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,069
so when we were working when we were

401
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,120
working with law enforcement they tell

402
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:52,340
us that the the folks that the these are

403
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,660
not these are not cheaply made devices

404
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,640
when you actually get your hands on one

405
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,630
of these they have kind of this

406
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,670
professional quality to them and the

407
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,350
people that they find that install the

408
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,870
skimmers or that they find with skimming

409
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,240
equipment in the car are are never the

410
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,120
people who engineer them or build them

411
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,390
so it's it's kind of a hierarchy of

412
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,860
crime in some sense and what motivates

413
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,990
you know what gets them into that

414
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,990
business to begin with I I don't know

415
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:28,640
Lou Costello Samsung research America

416
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,850
I'm curious if you have advice for the

417
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,980
user something the apps basically what

418
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,590
can they do to protect themselves for

419
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,750
example I often use a small cash card I

420
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,400
keep a couple hundred dollars on it that

421
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,860
should be the maximum that I would lose

422
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,939
if I were a victim of a scammer right

423
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,320
but are there other things that you

424
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,330
suggest that we can do in the meantime

425
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,090
well while these defenses you've

426
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,340
suggested are being distributed yeah

427
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,100
so you know the best advice that I can

428
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,380
give is to is to contact your you know

429
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,970
contact your legislators and and help

430
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,630
them make the decisions to make these

431
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,060
make these devices more secure to get in

432
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,800
I I like the idea that you limit your

433
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,260
risk by using a card that doesn't have a

434
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,680
lot of that doesn't have a lot of cash

435
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,819
on it but I will say that you know one

436
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,530
thing that I've been told in the past

437
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,480
that people will try and use is they'll

438
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,389
use a specific gas card you know they'll

439
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,540
get a branded gas card that they only

440
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,880
buy gas with I mean criminals actually

441
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,740
try to skim these as well because what

442
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,260
they can do is they'll they'll take

443
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,120
these gas cards and they'll go by you

444
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,460
know hundreds of gallons of gas and

445
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,250
they'll load them into you say water bed

446
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,410
liners in a van and then go down to

447
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,929
truck stops and sell the gasoline for

448
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,139
pennies on

449
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:46,289
dollars so there's even value in there's

450
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:47,610
even value in those gas cards but you

451
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:51,509
know I would say you know one of the

452
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,369
things that I do is and after having

453
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,649
done this research is I look for the

454
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:57,209
seals if the seals are wrong I tell the

455
00:17:55,649 --> 00:18:00,418
people that are inside you know you

456
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,360
can't necessarily make them take the

457
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,360
appropriate action or to inspect the

458
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,189
pumps but every little bit helps for

459
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,580
private customers are you personally

460
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,100
liable for fraud you're not right but if

461
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,470
use a gift card you lose your money yeah

462
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,418
so it depends it really depends so each

463
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,769
kind of payment instrument that you have

464
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,159
whether it's a credit card a debit card

465
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:25,529
a gift card you know private cards etc

466
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:28,889
each of these comes with its own with

467
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:31,139
its own risk for the user so I would say

468
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:39,600
you know just be aware of what your risk

469
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:41,340
is cool any other questions in that case

470
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,889
let's think the leg again

471
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,889
[Applause]
