1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,049
thank you for the introduction my name

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,369
is Tatsu from the University of Chicago

3
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:17,810
this is joint work with my colleagues

4
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,360
Amanda max

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,490
Tavian please saying this word we

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,679
introduced new techniques for reasoning

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,979
scientifically about password cracking

8
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,330
software but wait a minute

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,210
what are you been talking about pastors

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,519
here I know many people say that pastors

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,790
are dead but here we are stealing the

12
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:40,600
word of pastors you imagine password

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:45,320
check for go is this a good password

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,090
will it survive an attack so one type of

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,399
attacks we need to worry about is

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,359
offline guessing where the hackers

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,579
trying to crack a hash a password or

18
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,250
have have some protective file so what

19
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,780
they would do is they'll make a guess

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,300
hash it and check their guess

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,089
for example to guess one two three four

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,700
five six and compare these two things

23
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,160
and they will keep doing this until

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,030
there's a match so now they know the

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,460
password is she for go so ultimately

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,150
what we care about here is I have a

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,070
password will it be cracked or not but

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,600
this is a complicated question it

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,908
depends on all the assumptions you're

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,220
making here from the attackers

31
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,220
motivation to the hardware you seem to

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,950
have access to so common obstruction we

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,439
did here is that we model a plus word

34
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,689
half and you count how many other things

35
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,508
I guess before I guess in this password

36
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:45,320
ventures that is we are carrying this

37
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:48,140
password into a guest number in this for

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,669
example the guest number six when your

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,850
attack the guest number might be

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,920
something like thirteen billion and if

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,829
this guest never smarsh many other

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,009
things I guess before this password so

43
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:03,710
the password is probably strong and if

44
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,710
the number is small here is the password

45
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,630
slightly to the week and since we're

46
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:12,500
modeling I attack here it raises the

47
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,870
question of how passwords our guest so

48
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,120
how are they guest

49
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,160
the first thing you will do so the best

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,949
source for getting a password is harder

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,370
castles and nowadays more than billions

52
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,830
of

53
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,540
I'll lick so the first thing you would

54
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,330
do is you will sort them by descending

55
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,940
frequency and try them but the out of

56
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,379
gas is quickly because on modern

57
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,170
machines you can make billions of

58
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,819
guesses per second for fast ashes so

59
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,839
what if you haven't guessed the password

60
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:44,079
what's next so this is where the

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
password cracking method is coming and

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,920
there are tours of password cracking

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,958
methods on the one side are the

64
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,569
probabilistic models that we as a

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,250
researchers use on the other side and

66
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,099
software tools like strong European

67
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,500
hatchet these are the tools used by

68
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,940
InfoSec professionals and the robot

69
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,799
hackers

70
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,370
so given cracking method how do we get a

71
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,200
guest number the community already knows

72
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,510
how to compute a guest number for the

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,369
proble makes models so this work will

74
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,609
focus our getting a guest number for the

75
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,340
software tools on the right side so how

76
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,099
do you do this how did you get a guest

77
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,410
number the naive way to do this is you

78
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,720
run the algorithm you're generating

79
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,720
guesses and you stop when the target

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,690
appears this is why if you don't have

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,090
six guesses what if you need to make a

82
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,760
core drilling gasses which is ten to

83
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,010
fifteen guesses what if you need to make

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,349
ten to twenty guesses and this is and

85
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,450
the password is at the end so the

86
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:49,459
problem here is that this approach does

87
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,560
not scale so this list sheryn Anthes

88
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,530
jaws of getting the guest count for

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,310
software tools so first want the process

90
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,410
to be efficient and second who asked as

91
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,989
I'll tell you later the software tools

92
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,630
require some detailed configuration so

93
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:10,190
we want a systematic and scientific

94
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,739
process for configuring this tools and

95
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:17,510
first I'll introduce what is the state

96
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:19,039
of the art for the properties for the

97
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,320
probable is models that we as

98
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:24,110
researchers use there's a faster way to

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,659
get a guest number a paper at CES 2015

100
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,610
introduced using Monte Carlo methods to

101
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,310
estimate a guest number without running

102
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,580
the algorithm so we can get gas number

103
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,159
efficiently and of course the gas number

104
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,580
depends on configuration

105
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:41,558
but this is somehow already building for

106
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,209
this probabilistic models give me some

107
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:46,269
training data they mostly config

108
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:48,729
themselves so everything is fine for

109
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:51,610
this models and they have some good

110
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:54,818
properties so first to guess the

111
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:59,349
official but the welcome time is slow

112
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:02,409
and this is why reward hackers are not

113
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:06,159
using this algorithms so what do you

114
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:08,169
have curse is the Pascal crackin

115
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,289
community has developed software tools

116
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,479
like generator and haschke and instead

117
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:16,269
of trying to generate some probabilistic

118
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,529
models they try to perturb words in a

119
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:20,289
way that human does when creating

120
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:23,409
password so humans might take a password

121
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:25,899
I can send sorry my tap it take a word

122
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:29,800
hand some digits make some character

123
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:32,979
substitutions or switch cases and this

124
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,989
is the inside sorry and for password

125
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:37,919
like for a word like Chicago you might

126
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:40,688
want to generate all the variances

127
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,599
listen to hear because they are

128
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:46,119
generating a way that human does so this

129
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:49,419
is the inside behind us to school and

130
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:51,669
this tools alaska's efficient but the

131
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,529
work on time for us take a journey so

132
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,269
you can generate much more guesses per

133
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:59,619
second so you can think of the hackers

134
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,990
as they're shooting with a machine gun

135
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:06,039
that they try to win this quantity of

136
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,829
equality and here comes the question

137
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:12,459
again here's my password tell me the

138
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:15,069
guest number well priority albert you

139
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:17,919
have to do this to naive way enumeration

140
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,899
but this is not going to work because

141
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,299
usually we have when you're typing a

142
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:24,849
password and you want to know the guest

143
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,339
number immediately but we see you

144
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:30,188
numeration at best you say come back

145
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:32,800
tomorrow and I'll let you know and this

146
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:36,459
expensive iteration also makes

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,319
configuration heart because every time

148
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:41,499
we try a new configuration you have to

149
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,199
wait hours to see how good it is and

150
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:46,360
this is to our work we introduce new

151
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,249
tools to reason scientifically about

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,939
rule or password cracking software to

153
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:53,619
address these two issues

154
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:58,509
but before I dive in he'll work let me

155
00:06:53,619 --> 00:07:00,969
explain how the stools work so the most

156
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,860
common attack performed by this tools is

157
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:06,099
what we call a mangled where this attack

158
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,469
he takes in two types of vehicles the

159
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,659
first a wordless which consists of

160
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,990
common passwords or any words that you

161
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,490
think are given as starting points

162
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,379
because the idea is to perturb words in

163
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,569
way that human does he takes in a rule

164
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:22,449
is that specifies how to perturb doors

165
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,300
and the tool will now issue stream of

166
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,819
gases you will first append one to super

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,279
ingesting for one and dampened one to

168
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,559
password and get special one and then

169
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,330
pen one to Chicago and gas Chicago one

170
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:36,459
and they move to the second rule apply

171
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,409
to everything the wordless and you keep

172
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,459
doing this until you out of words hand

173
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:44,680
rules so what do you wordless

174
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:47,610
generalists look like in practice a

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,919
wordless might have 20 million words or

176
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,019
500 million words while I roll is could

177
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,029
have five thousand rules or sixty five

178
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,469
thousand rules and with the typical

179
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,869
configuration like this you'll get

180
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:01,990
something from billions of gases Jones

181
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:05,159
of Gaza to quadrillions of gases but the

182
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,629
list here are just we as researchers use

183
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,610
evidence has shown that hackers have

184
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:11,649
their private word lists and rules that

185
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,860
are likely to be much better than what

186
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:17,319
we have and right now without investing

187
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,089
huge resources it's impossible for the

188
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,300
researchers to catch up with the list

189
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:25,499
hackers have and fortunately we make it

190
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:29,229
possible and now I'm going to tell you

191
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:34,209
how we do this so first I'd like to show

192
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,519
you how we make a snubber efficiently so

193
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:39,179
the first thing you want to know is

194
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,919
whether this password is correct or not

195
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,529
and normally you do this in the four

196
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,350
direction which of course requires

197
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:51,670
enumeration and as we establish this is

198
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:54,550
not going to work so anxiety is we can

199
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:57,519
go backwards suppose we have password

200
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,699
check for ago and we wonder will this

201
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,470
password be guessed by the first rule

202
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:03,280
well obviously it cannot be guessed by

203
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,370
the first rule they

204
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,410
shake forego does not end with someone

205
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,070
and now we wondered that shake Fargo

206
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,680
will be gas by the second room well

207
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,380
likely so what words should be in a

208
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,010
wordless to gastric fork and we term

209
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,920
this words

210
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,340
/ images and turns out in this example

211
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,569
there are two possible for images and

212
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,670
heed of this for images will be

213
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:33,310
transformed into the password after

214
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:36,880
apply the second rule and this actually

215
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,349
saves you a lot of time because if

216
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,910
you're doing it in the forward direction

217
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,700
you'll make millions or billions of

218
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,310
guesses but here we just need to do two

219
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,560
local to lookups in the world list to

220
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:51,760
say if it's Chicago in the words it's

221
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,119
check for go in the word list but thanks

222
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,310
for not oh is this easy genre Hashcash

223
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,530
supports more than 65 different types of

224
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,500
transformation some of them pretty easy

225
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,860
like appendages some of them overly

226
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,260
complex like / shortages and you can

227
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,630
even use rejection clauses to filter

228
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,240
unwanted guesses and what's even worse

229
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,760
is that you can compose different

230
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,610
transformations into one rule and this

231
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,230
is a rule from haschke what it does is

232
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,660
to switch the first and sixth character

233
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,670
and then the list the first three

234
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,680
characters and that's do you bring the

235
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,410
duplicate the whole word and finally

236
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,750
truncate the word to last seven and now

237
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:35,410
I have a password can you tell me what a

238
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,660
producer well called who knows and in

239
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,870
fact were able to support the majority

240
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,630
but not all of the transformation and we

241
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,160
can deal with arbitrary composition so

242
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,290
what we did is that we introduced some

243
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,120
intermediate data structure to repeat

244
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,120
them to represent the results

245
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,750
efficiently and that's now we know which

246
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:02,320
word and which rule would guess the

247
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,450
password but we also have to know how

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,810
many other things I guess before our

249
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,880
target suppose we know how many rules

250
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,890
sorry how many cases are made by each

251
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,650
rule we can quickly found this number

252
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,580
and in this example the gas number is

253
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,079
between four and

254
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,630
but we also know that she carries the

255
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,090
word that cracks the password so we can

256
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,790
use Chicago's position in the word list

257
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:33,660
to ask them a to get the guest number

258
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:35,579
within the bound but in reality it's

259
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,980
often non-trivial to get against number

260
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:43,770
so to get a number of guesses made by

261
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:47,550
issue the module so a major complication

262
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:50,160
is here is when rejections are used for

263
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,990
example here we say skip this guess if

264
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,140
the word does not have any otherwise

265
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,920
replace it with 4 so we have the reason

266
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,960
about how many words have an a and this

267
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,120
gets even more complicated because the

268
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,370
rejections could appear anywhere in the

269
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,050
room and this will introduce very

270
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:13,500
complex dependencies and as usual were

271
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,469
able to handle most but now not all of

272
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,180
the transformations hand can deal with

273
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,580
arbitrary composition what we did here

274
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,699
is that we represent the dependencies

275
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,100
has tensors and make one pass over the

276
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,810
rules over the word list and now you can

277
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,690
count how many guesses are made by issue

278
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:35,489
efficiently so with this new tools we

279
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,190
are they we enabled fast

280
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,940
test number estimation the benchmarking

281
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,950
our performance our raw data we use the

282
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,200
word the length name password um as a

283
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,990
word list and a rules caused by the law

284
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,340
to get at our issue three times 10 to

285
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,950
the 14 guesses and if you enumerate

286
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,530
everything once and save it to disk it

287
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,920
takes you three petabytes of data well

288
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,300
we only need ten kicks of space and

289
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,949
pipey everything to this what takes you

290
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,949
more than two years and of course this

291
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,710
is io bounded well we just need last 10

292
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,810
day to do some pre-processing and after

293
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,220
the one time pre-processing we ask me

294
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,380
the guest number in the last thing a

295
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,510
second we don't have we don't know the

296
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,580
lookup time for the naive approach

297
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,300
because we didn't pipe three petabytes

298
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,300
to your disk

299
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,850
and now it comes to your second go we

300
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,220
want to be able to reason about

301
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:36,029
different configurations and potentially

302
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,950
identify the best one so the

303
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,290
configuration of the stools is just the

304
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:43,110
world list handle rulers more

305
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,270
specifically the performance of this

306
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,520
tools to be hands on depends on the art

307
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,939
of the rules as well as what this rules

308
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,010
are

309
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:55,050
he also depends on the author for words

310
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:57,450
and what this work and now any side here

311
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,939
you still use data for example leaked

312
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,150
password says to improve the

313
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,190
configuration using this personal

314
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:09,329
training data we determine the new

315
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,130
configuration in the interest of time

316
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,520
I'm just going to cover how we are the

317
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,490
rules

318
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,720
and how we improve the contents of the

319
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,210
wordless so the first question we ask

320
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,610
here is shoot the rules in a different

321
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,830
order you know whole key idea is to

322
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,570
order the rules by guessing officiants

323
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,760
basically we order them by the number of

324
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:34,170
cracks per guest from high to low for

325
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,600
example let's look at the spider lab

326
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:40,050
rulest which was manually ordered for

327
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,390
some human expert and that's brought the

328
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,030
guessing code sorry let's for the

329
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,580
percentage of password crack and y-axis

330
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,819
versus the none the total number of

331
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,670
tests is made on the axis for a

332
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,050
particular password set here's how the

333
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,020
guessing curve would look like look like

334
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,349
with the rules in their origin in their

335
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:04,350
original order and now suppose you know

336
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,680
everything in the tessa and reloaded the

337
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,350
rules so basically what we're doing here

338
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,229
so we try and test on the same test so

339
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,480
you will get somehow an idea order of

340
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,610
the rules and what should that curve

341
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,180
look like so you'll get something like

342
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,550
the red dotted line here and instead we

343
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,890
train the order on some other houses

344
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,890
so basically we're testing on one set

345
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:32,069
and training on the other set and we can

346
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,410
see here the data-driven approach is

347
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,540
nearly as good as the open wall you

348
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,920
could get and this shows the power of

349
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,639
data Jordan carefully

350
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,248
and we're also interested in what other

351
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,379
words should be in the worthless and our

352
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:48,889
inside here's we should add the per

353
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:51,059
images that are missing in borderless

354
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,970
recall that we are looking for pre

355
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,399
images in the wordless so what is a pre

356
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,040
image appears a lot but it's not in the

357
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,319
wordless this is like cash missions and

358
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,719
we should probably added to doorless and

359
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:09,149
we rent this for images by frequency and

360
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,970
we're able to identify three types of

361
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:14,759
missing perimeters the first is site

362
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,350
specific our results suggest that to

363
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,410
attack passwords from battlefield heroes

364
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:22,259
you should add words like bf heroes of

365
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:25,290
course it's not generalizable but this

366
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:28,799
actually sanity checks that our work our

367
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:32,579
approach makes sense and we Canada we

368
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:35,009
also identified generalizable words like

369
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:37,559
master brain if master brain could have

370
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:40,019
tracked passwords in one set you might

371
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:44,100
help correct cursors and another set and

372
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:46,350
this was actually the case and finally I

373
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,290
identified show series that crack

374
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,029
passwords in multiple tests says this is

375
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,669
interesting because when you work when

376
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:55,980
someone is constructing wordless these

377
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:58,079
common passwords or worse from

378
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,980
dictionaries but they're really taking

379
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,299
into consideration

380
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,819
they're really taking into consideration

381
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:05,579
of the word a sort of the rules they use

382
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:08,970
and these short strings when paired with

383
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:12,388
some rules are actually very helpful and

384
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,850
to wrap up we introduce some of the

385
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:16,678
first analytical tools for reasoning

386
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,629
scientifically about where password

387
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,000
cracking software and build on top of

388
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,919
these tools were enabled fast guess

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,019
number estimation we also build

390
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,079
configuration tools for word list hand

391
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:31,019
rules and we also open sourced our code

392
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,059
on github so feel free to play with and

393
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,340
from now I'm happy to take any questions

394
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:39,879
thank you

395
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:42,620
[Applause]

396
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,540
we have some time for questions if you

397
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,760
have a question please do come up to the

398
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,860
mic

399
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,830
hello thank you very nice talk very nice

400
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,590
work I'm Rahul from Cornell so I have

401
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:58,280
one question the the rule set that is

402
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,659
used by Sean the Reaper aren't they the

403
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,430
following areas regular language

404
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,490
categories like regular languages or

405
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,380
pcfg s so that we can like quickly use

406
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,250
the techniques tools from there to

407
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,630
estimate the guest number sorry

408
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,940
review person yeah sure I didn't get the

409
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,220
last part I'm saying like does the rules

410
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,190
that are used by John the Reaper mm-hmm

411
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:22,940
they don't fall any standard categories

412
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,300
like regular languages or pcfg how the

413
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,160
rules are actually specifies how to

414
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,399
transform the words so I guess they

415
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,200
don't fall into languages like it's like

416
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,290
a transformation rule so you have taken

417
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,150
input as one word and then you apply set

418
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,000
of transformations which is represented

419
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,160
as a state machine mm-hm

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,960
so I'm Jessica is it any standard set

421
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,040
machine like aren't there regular

422
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,530
languages um sorry I don't think I get

423
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:56,510
your questions all right I'm having did

424
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,840
talk about a lot yeah thank you i Scott

425
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,190
Rudy from the University of Tennessee so

426
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,020
really cool work especially if you're an

427
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,210
adversary you've given them a nice new

428
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,250
powerful tool so from the perspective

429
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,290
the defender though it feels like the

430
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,550
reduction in the guests estimates that

431
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,379
you're giving well more accurate are

432
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,850
still within the kind of that uncanny

433
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,320
valley between offline guessable and

434
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,889
online guessable so how does this

435
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:22,159
information effectively help defenders

436
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:24,440
okay very interesting question so I

437
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,170
think one thing we mentioned in my talk

438
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,390
is that odd yet the attack has actually

439
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,550
having invested huge resources to their

440
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,350
world is Henry Willis so they probably

441
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,320
already get something that's nearly

442
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,030
optimal so we do so we do help the

443
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,429
attackers a little bit but they're

444
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,220
already there what we did most is like

445
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,680
we helping at we helped the researchers

446
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,900
to faster to quickly catch up with what

447
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,530
do you taggers have not as catching up

448
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,100
help us

449
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:55,820
better is my question oh how does

450
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,280
Ketchum makes it better cuz so basically

451
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,590
you want to we want to model what scene

452
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,600
I guess what would real worded heck is

453
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,389
and this is the real word attacks so we

454
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,020
want to understand what attackers would

455
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:11,060
do right with their I guess wordless

456
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,370
animal list so this gives us a sense of

457
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,590
what they might like what attacks you

458
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,850
might have to attack your because real

459
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:22,689
scenarios okay thanks thanks

460
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:28,218
all right let's think out skin

461
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,219
[Applause]
