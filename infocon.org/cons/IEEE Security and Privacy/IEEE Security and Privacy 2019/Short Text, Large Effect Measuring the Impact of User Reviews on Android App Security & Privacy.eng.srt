1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,389
good morning everyone my name is Duke

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,160
and today I'm going to talk

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,840
how we measure the impact of user

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,300
reviews on Android app security and

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,099
privacy and this is the join group with

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,390
Eric Mike wins win at this aspire

7
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,730
Helmholtz Centre for information

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,939
security so let's talk about user

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,040
reviews or app reviews user reviews are

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:32,719
useful because on one hand side they

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,399
provide other user insightful

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,590
information so that they can decide

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,170
whether or not to install the apps based

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,850
on the other users experience on the

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,760
other hand side they also provide

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,039
developers useful information such as

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,470
user future request user sentiments as

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,630
well as suggestions for improvements and

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,970
this is very important because this

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,239
creates incentives for developers to

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,730
improve their app toward better versions

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,820
so with that in mind we ask ourselves

23
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,559
three questions first do user talk about

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,590
the security and privacy problems of

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,600
Android apps in their reviews second if

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,630
they do what make them care about their

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,298
security and privacy and last very

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,000
important do user reviews lead to app

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,799
security and privacy updates so to

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,900
answer to answer these three questions

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,210
we aim to study the condition between

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,720
user reviews and Android apps secure and

33
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,729
privacy evolution and now I'm going to

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,220
give you an overview of our approach and

35
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:35,000
later on I will explain each components

36
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,460
in details so we start our approach with

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,490
a crawler that crawls or app reviews and

38
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,229
a version his story by saying version

39
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,199
his story I mean we download all app

40
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,090
releases and four reviews for our

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,070
reviews we want to know whether a given

42
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,460
review is secure and privacy related or

43
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,439
not

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,270
therefore we built a review classifier

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,029
using machine learning and natural

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,740
language processing techniques on the

47
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,900
other hand side we want to know whether

48
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,539
a given update is security and privacy

49
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,150
related or not therefore we perform

50
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,269
static analysis on the app version

51
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,470
history once we have the set of svr

52
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:12,019
which is the security and privacy

53
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,730
related review and the set of SBU which

54
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:15,860
is the security and privacy related app

55
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:21,590
updates we'll map them together using

56
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,840
our SB mapping component first our

57
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,150
crawler so we want to crawl our version

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,310
history unfortunately Google doesn't

59
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,840
provide such information so we have

60
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,810
to look for alternatives from

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,540
third-party store such as a penny apk

62
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,270
for fun and aberrant and in this work we

63
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,920
focus on English reviews only and we

64
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,560
gather additional information such as

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,768
rating score or the date that the review

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,319
has been written and we focus on the

67
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,920
apps that have at least 15 million

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:56,208
downloads and this results in 2583

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,980
applications totaling in about 63

70
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,130
thousand versions meaning that an app

71
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,410
has on average 24 versions and wholly no

72
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:07,640
these results in around 4.5 million

73
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,230
reviews so now we have the data set the

74
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,298
first thing we want to do is you want to

75
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,310
know whether or we have we want to have

76
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:15,140
an automatic approach to detect whether

77
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,410
a given review is security and privacy

78
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,059
related or not but to do that we need to

79
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,430
define what is security and privacy

80
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,989
related review and to do so we need to

81
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,880
take a step back and define the term

82
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,069
from the end-user perspective meaning

83
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,650
that we consider what the end-user can

84
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:31,849
see from the Android applications and

85
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,010
therefore we focus on permission

86
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,780
protector resources because this is the

87
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,480
only information that is visible to the

88
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,130
end-users either by runtime permission

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,130
mechanism or insert and permission

90
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,620
mechanism and to enhance this definition

91
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,200
we also extract keywords based on

92
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,239
existing literature on user perception

93
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,069
of the security and privacy problems of

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,930
and replications and when a review does

95
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,730
not talk about any of these two aspects

96
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,850
then we consider them non security and

97
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,310
privacy relevant to give you and and a

98
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,120
few examples of how an SBR would look

99
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,250
like and give you some examples here

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,350
first new permissions why would this app

101
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,670
need access to my location so here the

102
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,450
user is talking about his or her

103
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,029
location permission secondly the second

104
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,918
user talk why does it need access to my

105
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,989
photos and videos so in this example or

106
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,729
in this review the user is talking about

107
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,250
a historical storage permission and last

108
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,990
why on God's good green earth those who

109
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,389
have need access to my location info

110
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,400
one-star for the privacy to do so in

111
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:40,250
this example the user does not only talk

112
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,549
about his or her location but

113
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,040
additionally he

114
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,250
is expressing that about her concern

115
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,740
regarding the privacy so now we have the

116
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,180
definition of what is a security and

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,730
privacy related review what is an svr so

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,310
we are going to be a review classifier

119
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,260
and to obtain a training data set we

120
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,330
randomly sample 4000 reviews and

121
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,690
manually label them so we managed to

122
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,180
label around 600 svr and around 3300 9

123
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,700
SBR and some of the reviews cannot be

124
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,380
labeled because they contain for example

125
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,469
only one word or they do not convey any

126
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,150
information to the coders to train our

127
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,480
classifier we use a support vector

128
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,190
machine and use bag-of-words to extract

129
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,050
futures for our classifier and in

130
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,960
particular we use an Engram of

131
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,040
characters to extract features and

132
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,169
before feeding the reviews to our

133
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,050
classifier we apply some processing

134
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:38,640
techniques such as stop wear removals or

135
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,620
steaming so to validate our approach we

136
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,840
use 10 fold valuation technique on a set

137
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,980
of manually labeled reviews which is

138
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,590
around 3900 s reviews for label reviews

139
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,380
and we use a OC metric to to measure how

140
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,849
well our classifier performance and for

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,460
those of you who are not familiar with a

142
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,040
OC metric this is an example of a random

143
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,739
guessing classifier you will have an IOC

144
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,340
of 0.5 and which is denoted by the red

145
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,200
line here and if you have a perfect

146
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,479
classifier you would have an IOC value

147
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,820
of 1.0 which is denoted by the blue line

148
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:18,900
here and our classifier has an F has a

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:23,460
mini OC value of 0.93 which is denoted

150
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,590
by the blue blue line here so now we

151
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,799
have a real classifier with an IOC of

152
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,780
0.93 the next step would be to detect

153
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,210
whether a given ability is security and

154
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,979
privacy related or not and again in this

155
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,109
step we need to look at the definition

156
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,090
of what is secure and privacy related so

157
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,520
we only focus on what is visible to the

158
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,530
end-users or what changes that can be

159
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,229
visible visible to the end-users what

160
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,140
the end-user can see and therefore we

161
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,450
again focus on the dangerous permission

162
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,370
changes between app updates but

163
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,389
furthermore we also want to know whether

164
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,969
we runtime permission mechanism

165
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,460
does in one way or the other change or

166
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:02,560
have impact on the user perception

167
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,719
regarding permission request of handler

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,250
applications therefore we also want to

169
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:07,870
identify whether an hour version has

170
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,030
runtime permission mechanism or in

171
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,610
certain permission mechanism and check

172
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,250
with the number of SPR later on so the

173
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,569
goal here is to find out the security

174
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,289
and privacy changes between any

175
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:23,620
consecutive versions so now we have a

176
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:27,580
review classifier and study abroad on

177
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,800
Isis the final step in our approach is

178
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,109
to map SVU or the privacy and security

179
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,050
related updates to SBR which is the

180
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,939
security and privacy related review and

181
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,789
let's assume that we have an app and

182
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:42,009
this graph depicts the app time line and

183
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,840
we for the clarity we only have four

184
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,419
reviews and let's assume that for the

185
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,188
second revelation has detected that this

186
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,159
is indeed a security and privacy related

187
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:53,500
review if there is such reviews we will

188
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,750
look forward to detect or to ask is the

189
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,669
NS view in the later versions of the

190
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,500
apps if there is we will consider them

191
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,240
as mapped of course this is an

192
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,930
approximation we will talk about that in

193
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,270
a couple of slides so now we have all

194
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,330
components of our approach let's come to

195
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,039
our empirical results first regarding

196
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,349
the security and privacy related reviews

197
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,419
using our classifier we have been able

198
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,539
to identify five thousand five hundred

199
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,120
twenty seven s BRR and around fifty

200
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,610
percent of them we can categorize into

201
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,400
different subcategories use using

202
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,289
keywords and here at least top ten

203
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,750
permission or permission groups that are

204
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:34,448
mentioned in user reviews and the list

205
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,799
is headed by storage contact location

206
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:40,598
camera and so on so remember the point

207
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,859
that I mentioned in a previous life we

208
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,500
want to know where the runtime

209
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,600
permission does in one way or the other

210
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,440
have impact on the user perception of

211
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,949
permission requests on Android so we

212
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,449
compare the amount of SPR or the amount

213
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:57,790
the amount of security and privacy

214
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:59,709
related reviews of app versions with

215
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,750
runtime permission and aversion within

216
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:04,359
some permissions and we have found that

217
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,459
our versions with runtime permission

218
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,179
mechanism received significantly more as

219
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,969
we are in comparing to

220
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:12,949
within certain permission mechanism and

221
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,349
to give you a rough idea of how this

222
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:18,469
trend although this looks like this is

223
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:22,999
an example of the amount of SVR of an ad

224
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,579
over time and x-axis teen represent the

225
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:28,429
release of the apps or the web version

226
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:31,449
history and here you see there's a

227
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:34,339
there's an increasing amount of SVR and

228
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:37,219
we look further into this and we found

229
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,959
that this is correlated with the

230
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,209
introduced introduction of runtime

231
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,638
permission mechanism so since the app

232
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:45,888
introduced runtime permission so it

233
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,989
switched from insert and permission to

234
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,699
runtime permission and this is

235
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:54,889
correlated with the increasing amount of

236
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:57,319
SVR so regarding the security and

237
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,389
privacy related updates using our static

238
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:02,868
analysis we have been able to

239
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:05,269
identifying around 6000 SVU and here at

240
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:08,569
least top 10 as vur the permissions that

241
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:10,929
are removed in half updates the list is

242
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:14,089
headed by read phone state get accounts

243
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:19,879
right rear storage and location and so

244
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:23,389
on so now there's a question is there

245
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:25,220
any overlap between SPR and SVU or do

246
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,059
users talk about the things that

247
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:31,309
developers are working on as well

248
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,839
because you are using our SP mapping

249
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:37,189
component we have been able to map

250
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:40,999
around a 3,500 or 3400 as we are to SBU

251
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:44,299
which is around 60% and to give you an

252
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:47,089
overview of how they talked as we are on

253
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:50,299
top SBU looked like here we have we put

254
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:52,369
two graphs together and intuitively you

255
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,129
look there's a storage for mission on

256
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:56,119
the left hand side and there's storage

257
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,579
permission on the right hand side so

258
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:01,369
users talk about storage developers

259
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:05,149
removing storage and similarly we have a

260
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:06,409
location so this gives give us a good

261
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:07,869
feeling that it seems like they are

262
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:12,470
talking or they are working on the same

263
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:14,029
problems so the real question now is do

264
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:19,129
reviews need to AP's

265
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:20,869
secure and for RC updates so to answer

266
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,730
this question we perform thorough

267
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:24,489
regression

268
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,279
to find out the factors that have impact

269
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:30,129
on security and privacy related app

270
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,529
updates and we use logistic logistic

271
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:35,169
regression to do so because the outcome

272
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:37,329
of our model is whether a given update

273
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:39,009
is security and privacy related it's

274
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,069
binary therefore we use logistic

275
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:45,040
equation and we focus on two types of

276
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:47,769
variables user variables and a variables

277
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,079
but now I would jump directly to the to

278
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,910
the result and how we I would invite you

279
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,399
to read our paper to see how we do up

280
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:59,290
build up the D models and how we choose

281
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:01,929
variables so to summary we have found

282
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,879
that SP are indeed leads to SBU meaning

283
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:06,279
that the more SPR and AB version

284
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,509
received the more likely that the next

285
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,759
update will be secured and

286
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,859
privacy-related

287
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:14,079
second the higher score and a version

288
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:15,189
receives the less likely that the next

289
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,118
update will be security and privacy

290
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:22,059
related and third the more developers

291
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:25,239
reply to user reviews the less likely

292
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:29,189
that they will release the next they

293
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:31,809
will release SVU as the next update and

294
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,759
add versions with one-time permission

295
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:38,559
mechanism mechanism are more likely to

296
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:40,569
release SVU and this is indeed in line

297
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,149
with the previous file found fighting

298
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:45,309
that have versions with runtime

299
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:48,160
permission received significantly more

300
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:52,629
SPR in comparing to app versions within

301
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,509
certain permission so to conclude in

302
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:58,089
this work we have found that users to

303
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:00,660
express the concern about the privacy

304
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,129
and security in their reviews and

305
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,379
runtime permission because mechanism

306
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:09,759
does raise more suspicion from the end

307
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:12,279
users and last but very important SPR or

308
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,739
security and privacy related reviews do

309
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,649
have impact on our security and privacy

310
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:22,299
update impact or here I mean positive

311
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:23,589
impact so with this work we we call for

312
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,049
action to make our behavior more

313
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,179
transparent to the end users which would

314
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,189
have to leverage their feedback that

315
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:32,649
create incentives for developers to

316
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:34,760
adhere to security and privacy batf

317
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,040
reduces

318
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,990
Center our work also called fashion to

319
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
make to support for developers who

320
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,150
better adhere to secure in Farsi bad

321
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,410
practices and with that I would like to

322
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:56,060
thank you very much for your attention

323
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:57,650
and I'm happy to take questions so we

324
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,209
have time for questions if folks want a

325
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,620
line up at the microphones and please

326
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:07,070
give your name and affiliation if you

327
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:09,440
mind good morning thank you very much

328
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,830
very nice talk thank you did you

329
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,980
actually see developers that retracted

330
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:19,820
of some feature actually cancel it

331
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:22,280
because of the review please for example

332
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,840
if somebody has an app with location

333
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,970
services that don't need to be in the

334
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,340
app and there are complaints about

335
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,200
concerns about that have you actually

336
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,750
seen indication that somebody pulled it

337
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,000
out of the software good question so I'm

338
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,790
actually - verifying the groud truth of

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,150
such situations we look into the Rebbe

340
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,689
do the replies of developers to such svr

341
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,420
- such complaints and we have found that

342
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:49,280
there are several situations first there

343
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,050
are cases developers thought the for the

344
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,510
majority of cases developers would

345
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,890
remove such permissions or they will

346
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,740
explain why they are near such

347
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,199
permission and sometimes they don't

348
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,940
remove but they explain and the other

349
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,740
time they explained that they have to

350
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,810
change from run tempo from instant

351
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,610
permission to runtime permission so that

352
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,040
they can request the permission only

353
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:18,500
when the functionality of the app is is

354
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:23,750
needed thank you hi I'm from Google and

355
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:26,840
ETH Zurich when an app has more when an

356
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,450
app has less SPU's do you have a sense

357
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,220
of when it means that the app is already

358
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,230
doing the good thing from a privacy and

359
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,610
security perspective in which case

360
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,380
there's no more update because it's

361
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,360
already doing some of the best it can or

362
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,910
whether it's actually improving because

363
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,950
there's a lot of signals like

364
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:46,730
the fact that developers who answer or

365
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,070
use runtime permissions get more gets

366
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,260
less and views it could mean that just

367
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,290
the app is already doing good right yeah

368
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,950
so so we also look into the attribution

369
00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:00,469
of the permission usage of the apps and

370
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,990
for the cases where developers don't

371
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,600
update or they cannot remove the

372
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:09,440
permissions they explain that there are

373
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,200
so the majority of cases the permissions

374
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,709
are used by third-party libraries so

375
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:19,970
they cannot do anything about it

376
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:21,649
thank you so one last question right now

377
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,690
everybody is using reviews as the

378
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,540
mechanism to give feedback to developers

379
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,370
is there a value to that being public or

380
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,349
do you think a separate forum for

381
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,890
surfacing this to developers actually

382
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,440
makes sense

383
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,660
I mean surfacing this approach to the

384
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
2-d right now users have to like right

385
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,020
into reviews which have like lots of

386
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,850
things that are going on and developers

387
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,890
may not see it but if you had a separate

388
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,170
feedback mechanism specifically say for

389
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,730
security or privacy or permissions you

390
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,170
can have value there but maybe that

391
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,940
hides it from users I didn't know if you

392
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,130
had a idea of like what's the approach

393
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,779
to surfaces easier to developers so I

394
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,760
think if you just have a separate

395
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,730
channel to notify developers then you

396
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,650
are removing the incentives part of the

397
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,750
the other users for example if you

398
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,300
complain a lot about an app and you see

399
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,859
that a now has low rating then the IU's

400
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,709
then you wouldn't download or install

401
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,479
the app so I think it has to be public

402
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,730
that the channel here the review channel

403
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,800
has to be public otherwise it loses the

404
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,949
incentives for developers to improve

405
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,780
their to whatever variants thank you all

406
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:25,289
right let's think the speaker again

407
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,289
[Applause]
