1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,570
okay hi everyone thank

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,260
Levin okay I'm sure honey

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,330
today I will present to you our work on

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,029
residential proxy as a tax aways so as

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,598
you all know Weber proxies are commonly

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,740
used to anonymize traffic to you way the

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,980
censorship

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,870
ought to avoid geolocation Li limits

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,910
examples include the Tor network

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,809
whipping or simple ATP or socks for

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:49,199
proxies however those proxies network

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,539
have some limited limitations so you

13
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,750
only have a limited number were x8 knows

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,690
and their access knows early deployed on

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,670
datacenter IP addresses and some of them

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,718
are you in public available such as a

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,750
list of Tor relays also many users may

18
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,720
share the same axis node so those action

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,600
nodes can be highly abused as shown in

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,300
previous study trafficker related Rose

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,490
proxy Network can suffer from sose

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:22,590
blocking or degradation recently some

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,220
proxy provider started to learn to read

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:32,119
the Sharpie proxy at the Zoe's examples

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,829
include luminary Joseph and proxy rec

26
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,079
CEO Lee claimed her millions of

27
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,360
residential appeals and decided the

28
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,658
apisa were clean and the you will never

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,299
get blocked also sell residential P

30
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:51,240
proxy at globally distributed and says a

31
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:53,100
new traffic limits so how it works what

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,039
the scale and the distribution of those

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,439
strategies are P proxies as they

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,159
actually residential ones as claimed by

35
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,798
those proxy providers also universal

36
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,149
residential ones how effectively can see

37
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,530
help to you with traffic detection

38
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,860
blocking besides how can so many

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:19,320
residential proxies get recruited by

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:22,019
those proxy providers besides who are

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,230
using those proxy services and for what

42
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,760
purpose your study will focus on to the

43
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,950
important questions

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,109
along with other interesting findings

45
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,780
such as the connection between different

46
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,739
proxy providers and also the threats to

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,340
the local network environment so let's

48
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,340
start how it works as a customer to

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,310
relay our traffic you had contacts the

50
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,849
proxy gateways which were selected the

51
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,660
executor proxy residential proxy -

52
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:57,328
activity or traffic so basically they

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,579
working in a bad connector model so the

54
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,940
residential proxies are actually hiding

55
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,459
from the customers

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,609
besides the early support ATP HP s and

57
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,670
also Sox protocol and multiple different

58
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,870
rotating strategies are supported such

59
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,809
as steaky gateways and the Gnostic is

60
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,760
not statist gateways first take a kid

61
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,280
away sir it will stick to the currently

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,629
rated HIV proxy for five or ten minutes

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,540
before switch to a new one for Gnostic

64
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:35,060
fanastic a gateways even we are randomly

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:39,720
selected with willable registered proxy

66
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,239
to relate the incoming traffic flow also

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,419
some proxy providers the you know allow

68
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,079
customers to decide which location to

69
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,849
activate their traffic you can decide

70
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:54,720
which country you can decide you in

71
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:56,790
which city to activate your traffic so

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,780
what's the skill of those residential P

73
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,168
proxies to understand this question

74
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,810
we'll set up our web clients which will

75
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,500
send traffic through those residential

76
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,019
proxies through our web service through

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,359
this manner our web servers can observe

78
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,329
the public IP addresses out of the

79
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,940
residential proxies one thing to note

80
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,139
you to request is identified by a unique

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,930
subdomain

82
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,479
also the pillow the work being encrypted

83
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,060
and signed because we don't want those

84
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,900
proxy providers know we are in fair

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,180
treating them with an go ahead to

86
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,210
purchase five popular

87
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,980
proxy providers and the conducted a

88
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,320
large-scale you

89
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:48,030
Trisha across the different amounts oh

90
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,540
we have sent out more than 60 million

91
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,969
successful probers and those progress

92
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,360
allowed us to capture more than 6

93
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:02,730
million unique ipv4 addresses that I

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,130
used for Raeleen traffic those tolls the

95
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,790
residential P proxies a globally

96
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:17,130
distributed unit more than 200 countries

97
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:18,630
and managed by 50k SPS also so why did

98
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,080
it is tribute hidden in the network

99
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,159
space as showing this picture in this

100
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,130
picture

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,740
each picks out the no / - never appear

102
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,580
without prefix and the color are we used

103
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,590
to pick the color we each pixel means

104
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,590
it's a number of residential proxies

105
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,640
identify the unities selects 24 prefix

106
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,820
as as you can see that what very widely

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,130
distributed in the network space clear

108
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:55,469
will scale up some small paths to show

109
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:57,810
more details ok media was millions of

110
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,430
wood residential proxies as they

111
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,470
actually residential our piece as

112
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,590
claiming the battle so the proxy

113
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,320
providers to answer this question we

114
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,599
have built up residential IP classifier

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,300
to decide whether so given our p is

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,490
residential or not we starting this

117
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,950
process by collecting ground truth from

118
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,130
different sources as surely investable

119
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:24,210
as different salsas tomato different the

120
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:26,490
noisy leg water so we use a high

121
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:31,080
confidence ground truth for trinium but

122
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:35,160
left at the noisy ones for evaluation we

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,590
then go to craft a set of features for

124
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,290
our classifier we observe that

125
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,400
residential appears our yearly directly

126
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,250
assigned about SP to homeowners also

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,940
because they are directly managed by SP

128
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,210
then network Haraka Haraka can be where

129
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,780
different from non residential our piece

130
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,450
based on toast

131
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,530
of observations we collect editing us

132
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,840
and the IP Whois data set to character

133
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,080
different properties out of the box

134
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,599
those are peas and they're perfect says

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,240
finally we got a certified good features

136
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,780
for our classifier one of them is a

137
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,419
number of domains resolve the tools up

138
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:24,000
select 24 IP prefix of the our cable

139
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:28,260
residential P proxy we then composer

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,150
balance the current rules to experiment

141
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,849
with the different classification

142
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:38,280
algorithms and also to their parameters

143
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,870
finally we select a random forest and

144
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,599
which has achieved a work good

145
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,450
performance with an apply this

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,090
classifier to predict whether the

147
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,640
capture the residential proxies are

148
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,789
actually residential ones and our

149
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,240
prediction shows that almost 60 million

150
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,580
of them are residential ones so for this

151
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,360
and for this question I will answer is

152
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,909
basically yes we thank you to another

153
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,600
question how effectively continue with

154
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:12,810
the traffic a detection of blocking tone

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,560
so this question will proceed flow we

156
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,320
are to be recognized as proxy user if

157
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,900
they can be recognized as proxy so

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,580
suicide can still block their traffic

159
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:28,710
all decorated the so is also we try to

160
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,440
identify if any malicious activity

161
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:35,039
connected with those resident repeat

162
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,860
proxies for the first question would

163
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,409
collect or settle OOP public available

164
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,890
proxy data set such as such as the Tor

165
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:48,180
relays for Weber proxies and also a p2

166
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:51,540
proxies always we thank correlated with

167
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,270
our retina Sharpie proxy data set result

168
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,329
shows that only a negligible portion

169
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,470
award to the resident repeat proxy was

170
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:05,160
shown up who uses public proxy data set

171
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,310
for the second problem we collected a

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,860
set of IP related a threat intelligence

173
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,150
and blacklist such as a botanist

174
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,529
Spamhaus

175
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:19,439
and also some some strata intelligence

176
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:22,410
platforms correlation shows that only 2%

177
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,600
of those residential proxies was shown

178
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:28,380
with with connection with malicious

179
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:33,500
activities so basically we can say so

180
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:36,240
the resident repeat proxy Holly USA so

181
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,180
media that will residential be proxies

182
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,800
that are highly us able so how can those

183
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,270
proxy providers recruit them it's it's

184
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,290
challenging to answer this question

185
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:52,560
we're starting from looking up some

186
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:55,410
legitimate recruitment channel provided

187
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,410
by those proxy providers we also

188
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,930
conducted the IP profiling to understand

189
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,980
the device types of those of residential

190
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,979
proxies another effort that we made is

191
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,980
to identify identify project toxic

192
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,160
programs that are actually relating

193
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,280
trafficking in the real world so for the

194
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,280
first part only Illuminati were found to

195
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,490
have recruitment channel through is a

196
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,699
whole new program hire work as a showing

197
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,580
pre-study holo programs are were

198
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:34,500
problematic they may incur a lot of risk

199
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:37,920
to common users with them or to profile

200
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:41,270
each capture the retina Sharpie Pro each

201
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,699
capture the reddit that entropy proxy

202
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,250
we've seen the Purple's took the rapids

203
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,030
and network banners for those proxies

204
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,670
and the more than 700 app is responded

205
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,900
at while panel grabbing and the more

206
00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:01,020
than 500 of them 500k of them gotta tear

207
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,089
the West have identified here shows the

208
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,870
top the west have identified in our data

209
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:10,170
side here you here is a top device

210
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,589
winners as you can see we have captured

211
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,060
a lot of getaway devices however we also

212
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,330
capture a lot of

213
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,779
outi devices such as the web cameras the

214
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,899
we are are you in printers

215
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:27,660
more importantly we have captured of the

216
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:32,699
devices for all five providers on the

217
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,509
ond our study including Illuminati once

218
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,060
into notice

219
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:38,850
luminate volume that has holo program to

220
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,369
recruit volunteers but their holo

221
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,309
program actually actually don't provide

222
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:49,199
a software that are compatible that can

223
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:51,420
be installed on those outer devices so

224
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:55,969
the next step is to identify programs

225
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,740
that are actually used to relay traffic

226
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,499
in this step we got help from our

227
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,949
industry partners which install software

228
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:07,379
on their users devices with a career

229
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:09,660
with agreement from Teddy their users

230
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,740
they were able to monitor the network

231
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,850
traffic potentially unwanted programs

232
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,399
through correlation with our

233
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,550
infiltration dataset we were able to

234
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,279
identify 67 potentially unwanted program

235
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,729
data that I used that would relay our

236
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:32,639
infiltration traffic and those programs

237
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,709
covered all five proxy providers also we

238
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,120
will send those programs to West total

239
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:44,628
for analysis 50 of them were labeled as

240
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:48,300
malicious by a lot of antivirus engines

241
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:53,699
so who are using to the retina Sharpie

242
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:56,699
proxies and for what purpose still with

243
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:58,258
help from the same industry partner we

244
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:01,740
were able to retrain with five million

245
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:06,689
traffic flows photos of 67 proxy proxy

246
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:09,389
programs and our our analysis of other

247
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:12,719
traffic destination shows that more than

248
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:17,250
9% awesome were reported as malicious by

249
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:22,949
West total racial categories reported by

250
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:26,279
Westall top here are some examples also

251
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:29,910
we manually studied at the top 1000

252
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,029
traffic destinations we are the

253
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,559
categories of those traffic destinations

254
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:36,499
at the you can say most of them are

255
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,920
either

256
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:43,529
domains and the URLs such as affiliate

257
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:48,179
networks mobile advertising or

258
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:49,110
advertising exchange also include the

259
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,529
search engines

260
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:58,499
shopping websites some malicious domains

261
00:13:52,529 --> 00:14:02,189
and also also social network websites so

262
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:05,639
we also identify some other interesting

263
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:07,410
findings first away firstly we identify

264
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,259
the connection between proxy providers

265
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,319
this paper shows the overlap of proxy

266
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:16,439
providers internal in term in terms of

267
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:21,290
the residential P proxies captured the

268
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:23,849
user network once they - no - is a

269
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:27,240
residential proxy will be counted as

270
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,759
overlap only only if this residential

271
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:35,699
proxy to capture the inputs proxy

272
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:37,589
providers in the same hour combine them

273
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:40,559
with other information we can conclude

274
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,329
that proxy online and the Joseph are

275
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,170
actually controlled by the same owner

276
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:49,099
and IPS is some kind of reseller or

277
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:53,759
customer follow Minetti

278
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,379
besides we identify that 3 out of 5

279
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,339
providers are actually a lot of local

280
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,660
traffic so what does this mean

281
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:03,809
instead I would send the traffic to our

282
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,790
web server what are you for with send

283
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:10,170
traffic to the loopback address it works

284
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:14,849
what is even within the traffic to the

285
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:17,339
private gateway address it works so what

286
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,999
are without actually we can get access

287
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:24,240
to the login page or many riders Wi-Fi

288
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:28,259
devices and even printers which means

289
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,269
that we can try different password and

290
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:35,699
then change the writers all those parks

291
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:37,679
appears another funny is the long tail

292
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:41,040
distribution of those residential RP

293
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,559
proxies as shown in this table in terms

294
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,939
of country and a assigns but the

295
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,469
different countries actually have

296
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:48,469
different distribution

297
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,850
as show for the user table they have

298
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,240
different the top countries so to

299
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,250
summarize we have captured millions of

300
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,930
residential appears that are Holly we

301
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:09,170
see also this ecosystem is very

302
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,479
prosperous and the service price is

303
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:16,149
getting higher at the mall the mall so

304
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,370
it's providers getting out however

305
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:22,880
without the street director to traffic

306
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,040
limitation so those kind of services we

307
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,149
are incur potential stress to the local

308
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,550
networking environment of the proxy peer

309
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:34,100
also the recruitment process is very

310
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,170
problematic the shows are poor mixer

311
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,040
will legitimate legitimate and

312
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:44,360
suspicious channels what makes us we're

313
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:47,089
concerned is based on the usage of those

314
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,819
processor with it we believe it has

315
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:54,230
become a very powerful in infrastructure

316
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:57,250
for online abuse activities also it can

317
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,230
be aware promising but worse toc

318
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:03,620
monitors in channel for compromised the

319
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,429
devices especially under the hood our

320
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,280
legitimate users and the volunteers as

321
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:13,490
we all know a lot that tear use of have

322
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,780
tools it's a well powerful and can be

323
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:19,900
one of the darkest lies thank you that's

324
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,899
all

325
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,800
oh we have time for questions anybody

326
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,180
what makes their way to the microphone

327
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,610
in the meantime I'm curious did you

328
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,290
engage with any of these proxy providers

329
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,850
to tell them about I mean so some of

330
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,260
these it sounds like maybe they are the

331
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,669
culprits but have you engaged for

332
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,410
instance with loominatee to let them

333
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,630
know that i forgot the name of that one

334
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,830
provider seems I'm selling them and this

335
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:48,410
access to local host yeah we actually

336
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:51,139
discussed without without collaborator

337
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:57,230
regarding this but because we found this

338
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:58,730
a little suspicious and isn't it

339
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,860
you should not likely you find our

340
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,720
attacker case then your reporter to the

341
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,990
window because of you believe with the

342
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,930
window you still on the good side right

343
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:14,630
so so but finally we decided now to

344
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:18,710
discuss so those finding in the wisdom

345
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:23,170
but but it was I still think maybe it's

346
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:26,300
a good idea yeah hi I mean from a lost

347
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,640
thanks for the great talk just like a

348
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,919
quick question is there any way for me

349
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,830
as an owner of a residential IP to find

350
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,370
out that this IP is participating in one

351
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,320
of these proxy networks I'm sorry

352
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,260
because a lot of people opinions at all

353
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,860
so is it is there did you find any way

354
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,330
that I as an owner as a consumer of

355
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,030
residential IP address that lives in my

356
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,810
home gateway is it possible that I find

357
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,760
out about that my device is

358
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,700
participating in a residential yes

359
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,960
that's a good question so your question

360
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:06,320
is basically can't find my devices on a

361
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,220
network it's actually participating

362
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:14,540
those residential proxy services right

363
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,970
right we are working on some kind of

364
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,379
with detection methodologies for the IP

365
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:23,360
from the SP side for them to detect

366
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:28,150
whether they are suspicious workflows

367
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:32,419
that are highly likely to be residential

368
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:36,950
relief relief activities but by now I

369
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:40,010
don't know a very good solution for

370
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,560
and the users of the SP to accurately

371
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,170
identify whether set devices or their

372
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,129
network has been used for such

373
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,020
connectivity

374
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:52,220
we're looking for some kind of detection

375
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:55,190
but wanted to note at assurances slide

376
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:59,390
we have website where you can find also

377
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:02,660
6 million read up he's captured in our

378
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:05,240
infiltration and and in fact you can

379
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,640
correlate within your own network to say

380
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,790
if there are a lot who appear captured

381
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:15,860
in your own network yeah thanks mmm

382
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,590
other another round of applause for Xiao

383
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,780
Hong

384
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,780
