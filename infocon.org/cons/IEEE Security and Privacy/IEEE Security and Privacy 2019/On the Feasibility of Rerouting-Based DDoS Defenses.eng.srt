1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,020
right thanks for the introductions so

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,030
good afternoon everyone my name is

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,850
marcin from the National University of

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,460
Singapore she's talking about the

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,220
feasibility of rerouting based leaders

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,590
defense and CDR I work with my advisors

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,960
mizzu can also from the National

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,900
University of Singapore and Susan Xiao

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,129
Wei Zhang Zhang supportin and useful one

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:39,160
from the National Taiwan University I

11
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:41,860
guess many people in this room may know

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,019
that leaders or disability help service

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,050
attacks are very common in the current

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,140
internet and traditionally volume matrix

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,328
DDoS attacks targets the end server but

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,600
in this talk we are more interested in

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:58,090
non-traditional Thai Abdera sectors that

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,149
target the transitioning between

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,730
autonomous system for example the inter

20
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:06,940
domain link connecting level 3 and

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,009
Comcast for example chances Langley -

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,950
attacks are introduced in academic

23
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:15,369
studies suggest Camaro and crossfire and

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,319
notice the two studies we have also

25
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,720
witnessed the real attack incident of

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:25,810
transitioning DDoS attacks for example

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:28,030
in 2013 an attack targets spam house and

28
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:32,440
almost wordplay of the entire Internet

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:36,420
and for example in 215 and I disconnect

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,420
protonmail service for almost a week

31
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:42,130
chances link DDoS attacks are hard to

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,670
handle and this attacks you did build

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:48,250
bonus to generate low rate traffic to

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,459
aggregate the traffic at the targeted

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,340
transitioning to consensus before before

36
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:57,310
that needing the traffic again and is it

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,979
hard to filter this attack flows because

38
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,670
attack traffic indistinguishable from

39
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:05,739
the B'nai traffic and more versed any be

40
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,140
nigh traffic flow that Trevor the

41
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:10,660
congested Ling will also experience the

42
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:14,220
poor performance and the victim are in

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,840
barely affected by the congested me

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,510
Chansey slinky does act acts thing women

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,180
an open problem despite several nests

46
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,649
our defense proposal in the last day

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,959
there are well-known sourcing to

48
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,250
transitioning the dog sectors so as choy

49
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,730
and zebra

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:34,370
however they rely on the future internet

51
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,859
architectures and hence not available in

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,620
the current internet there are several

53
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,650
other sources as well that try to make

54
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,870
the transitioning DDoS attacks less

55
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,900
effective however they are only pass all

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,799
solutions at best and very recently in

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,810
2018 are they new a post call routing

58
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,510
around possession proposed by Smith at

59
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,910
all that's cream to be readily

60
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,099
deployable solution in the current net

61
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,130
for transitioning leader sectors and in

62
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:06,048
our work we evaluate whether right so

63
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,620
we're acting based on my routing around

64
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:12,319
concession are feasible or not so they

65
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,720
try to understand how routing around

66
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,720
consistent work but first we have to go

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,060
to this super high level overview of how

68
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,489
busy P routing protocol works in the

69
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,019
current internet so busy be a part

70
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:28,579
vector routing protocol in which the

71
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,250
routing message carried the interim in

72
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:33,380
part and it broadcast to the entire

73
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,109
internet and as you can see from this

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,660
animation the nest agent sent our busily

75
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:41,120
message and as hop the a s number

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,650
appended in to the message and after

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,630
learning the AES part

78
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,400
include in the busy bee message the

79
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,889
source of the traffic in the sends a

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,230
traffic and there are true

81
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,959
characteristic a busy bee protocol we

82
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,690
would like to highlight here first the

83
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,870
AES part included in the busy message it

84
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,709
grantee to be lovely otherwise the

85
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,049
traffic will be forwarded in loop and

86
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,389
second the destination of the traffic

87
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:11,810
has no control over the traffic part by

88
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,310
design so we will now may wonder if the

89
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,920
destination has no control over the

90
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,070
traffic part then how the destination

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,649
can perform any rerouting to avoid the

92
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,409
transition in video stack dust turnstile

93
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,539
routing around concession exploit one

94
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,440
basic feature of busy people to course

95
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:32,960
as we just mentioned earlier about the

96
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,030
loop free as part and let me try to

97
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,198
explain how about in Oracle doesn't work

98
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,469
with this example

99
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,940
so in this example we have to our

100
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,370
destination of the traffic on the left

101
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,009
hand side the sauce yes in the Rhine

102
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,210
side and the traffic party hunted in the

103
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:53,270
blue color here and the original part

104
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,239
currently under concession so the

105
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,090
artwork the destination are one to avoid

106
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,930
the concession by V Rao is critical

107
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:06,500
traffic aroused uphill and we rise into

108
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,229
a new d2 apart so the trick here is not

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,470
the victim win creates a special busy.we

110
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:15,380
message which we call visible poisoning

111
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,590
message this includes a adaptive in the

112
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,620
areas part from the beginning this BCP

113
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,479
positive message a propagate to

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,039
propagated to option by yes except a

115
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,349
snap till who in c is OS number in the h

116
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:35,120
part and drop in new to the loop

117
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:38,509
detection algorithm so we we say a SW in

118
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,389
now poison so by simply poisoning is nap

119
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:44,120
till the victim destination can create a

120
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:46,520
detour and we now is critical traffic to

121
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,250
the detour part and there is a beauty of

122
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,830
these ideas is that it doesn't require

123
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,500
any a s corroboration we make it very

124
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,870
available in the Korean internet and the

125
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,759
victim destination just doesn't require

126
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,990
any permission of the action biased and

127
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,580
can initiate the rerouting by itself so

128
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,789
ranting Oracle doesn't seem to work

129
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,669
pretty well so we have a question we're

130
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:13,580
routing around translation defense still

131
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:16,039
work against adaptive attackers weekends

132
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,219
after learning about the the behavior of

133
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:22,789
the defense can change and adaptively

134
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:25,820
change the attack strategy so in our

135
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:28,810
work we saw such adaptive exactly in

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,000
this possible and very effective in fact

137
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,710
and meeting the mitigation against these

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,870
adaptive attack in challenging in

139
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,638
practice and we also discussed the

140
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:42,830
future lesson for transitioning leaders

141
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:45,080
to defense we pop our new adaptive

142
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,969
attacks and we call it the d2l learning

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,590
attacks so here's a treadmill rules as

144
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:53,490
we considers the adversary has three

145
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:56,820
taco in three step which are to detect

146
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,800
the rerouting in real-time and to learn

147
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,099
the new little but accurately and

148
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,630
finally to contest the new d2 part so

149
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,520
for the in terms of time we will focus

150
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,340
on the first two attack bone in this

151
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,190
talk and for the third attack on freeze

152
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,299
check out our papers and our determining

153
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,500
attacks use a same bonus as you in the

154
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,220
transitioning video sectors which mean

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,610
we don't require any additional attack

156
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,830
capabilities so as a first part of the

157
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,970
experience of how every more adversary'

158
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:32,909
can detect rerouting in real time in our

159
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,060
attack an adversary every few minutes or

160
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,070
so when helped Barnett to measure the

161
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,500
traffic part to was a victim destination

162
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:45,270
using using some active measurement tool

163
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,760
nitrate Rao they when the victim

164
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,120
decision sent out the busy be pausing

165
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,030
message and we're out is critical flow

166
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,820
into the d2 apart say an important

167
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,460
observation that some a es that are not

168
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:03,030
on the detour part now is I in this

169
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,510
example we also visit received busy P

170
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,520
positive message and hence yes I will

171
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,039
also change the traffic path towards a

172
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,109
victim destination to the d2 apart which

173
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,820
allow the adversary to see the sudden

174
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,420
change in the raw measurement and

175
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,240
detective rerouting in Vietnam so as you

176
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,730
can see from from this example detecting

177
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,150
rerouting seem to be easy

178
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,220
however the second step how to learn the

179
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,280
correct need to pass a much more

180
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,110
challenging so put our to put into the

181
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,589
context let's take a look at example

182
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,600
right here and the adversary are my

183
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,460
conscience or own issue the botnet in

184
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,380
practice and it's one of them may have

185
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,320
different raw measurement towards a

186
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,920
victim destination so the practical

187
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,870
challenge for the adversary here is that

188
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:57,270
with Rao a more accurate measurement

189
00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,000
observe actually two apart so we also

190
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,910
need to prioritize the route starting

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,889
from the boat aah Danny make closer to

192
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,379
the

193
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:10,679
the traffic sauce and intuitively the

194
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,899
closer is tend to helps a similar BGP

195
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,589
provocation part and hence the similar a

196
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,379
the traffic pass as well they could be

197
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,089
several other metric to measure the

198
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,809
distance between the yes but in our

199
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:27,629
attacks we use a a s part land from the

200
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,969
selected round measurement our adversary

201
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,949
can contest the chances link this as a

202
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,899
one hop away from the victim

203
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:37,949
so that the victim cannot detect attacks

204
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:41,429
and for more detail on this please check

205
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:45,029
out our papers and as a reason our

206
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:48,089
adversary can achieve about 94% of the

207
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,899
correct need to a pub and that by the

208
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:57,119
way we have this reason using the way

209
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:58,589
stick me right botnet latest so in the

210
00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:00,990
second part of talk we even show you

211
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:03,990
that the detour learning attacks a very

212
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,850
hard to mitigate in practice so the main

213
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,639
reason that make the detour learning

214
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,069
attack are possible he that summer yes

215
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,910
are not on journey to a partner a s I

216
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:16,979
and ASD is this example also user need

217
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,329
to apart and learn about the detour pop

218
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:24,509
so we argue that the b2 apart must

219
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:27,748
achieve a very desired properties which

220
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:31,139
we call so isolated me to a part o the

221
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:34,230
dito past must be isolated so a detour

222
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,660
it could be he said to be isolated are

223
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,240
when is he used exclusively for the

224
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,179
critical traffic only and then when this

225
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,490
happened no as a flow we learn about the

226
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:47,490
detour part and then the detour learning

227
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,949
attacks in no longer possible so the

228
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,059
question here that how do we isolate the

229
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:57,209
d2 a part and as we mentioned earlier

230
00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:00,569
about the busy bee poisoning we have to

231
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:03,748
present all peers up to a s on the

232
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,969
deeper part when this happens only the

233
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:08,189
AES on the d2 apart we learn about the

234
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:12,660
detour and hence the D topaz can be

235
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:15,240
isolated but what we figure out that to

236
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,120
achieve the lead topaz isolation we may

237
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,939
have to poison to many areas

238
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,249
so we actually cows on the number of AES

239
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:25,099
should be poisoned to achieve the dito

240
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:27,620
part and so within this CDF plot so as

241
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,370
you can see from CCDF plot we can easily

242
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:34,220
have thousands of AES to eat poison it's

243
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,589
quite surprising and but I mean why do

244
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,019
we have to poison so many of them so we

245
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:42,379
took a closer look on the AES that on

246
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:45,439
the deeper part and we find out that we

247
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:50,170
can almost always find at least one tier

248
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:53,240
1 or lastly HOAs on the detour part and

249
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:56,089
this is like can easily have thousand

250
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,149
dollars appearing a yes so the main

251
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:03,110
question here now is that can we present

252
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:05,809
that many years we actually look at the

253
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,259
busy bee specification and confirm that

254
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:13,519
the specification can allow one busy P

255
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:17,209
message to carry about 2030 4s in one

256
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,509
single PCB message this mean about 90

257
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:22,819
I'm sorry about 80 percent of the detour

258
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,829
past can be isolated who is he not too

259
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:27,620
bad actually but when we look at the

260
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:29,839
implementation of busy P in practice in

261
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,509
the router and we couldn't find out that

262
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,019
some router vendors like cisco routers

263
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:39,050
only on our up to 250 PI a as in one

264
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:42,259
single busy message this mean they are

265
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,809
only 5% of the depot path can be

266
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,839
isolated and was yes we talked to

267
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:51,139
several ISP and we learned that they may

268
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,589
allow busy bee poisoning but up to 30 or

269
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:57,920
50 is at most but no more than that

270
00:12:53,589 --> 00:13:00,800
so as you so the short answers to the

271
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,410
question is that Title II that no we

272
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,469
cannot poisons as many areas and to

273
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,899
confirm this we perform on a scale

274
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,420
passive and I assist of the actual busy

275
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,939
bee message and so the reason is this

276
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,040
plot so the excesses indicate the number

277
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,110
way as seen in the busy bee message and

278
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,319
the wisest is a number of between

279
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,170
message our analysis so that the vast

280
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:28,579
majority of busy bassist have less than

281
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:30,410
30 yes in the s part and literally when

282
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,628
we see more and more a s

283
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,060
in the missive images we seen less and

284
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:39,949
less number of PCB message and very

285
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:44,060
interesting we see a 50-ton drop around

286
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:46,969
the trettel of 255 we confirm that the

287
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:51,518
majority of isp do not support poisoning

288
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,810
more than 255 a years so to conclude

289
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,259
poisoning thousand areas is really

290
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,869
impossible or in other word Nieto pass

291
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:02,870
isin infeasible and little learning and

292
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,620
taxi always are almost own way possible

293
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,740
so what as a future dozen for the

294
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,540
chances Lindley last defense we cannot

295
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,000
use rerouting sources in the current

296
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,250
Internet and the chances DDoS attack

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,610
still women an open problem

298
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,079
so we argue that for future dicen of the

299
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:26,389
chances leaders defense they a disciple

300
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:29,000
probably for the defense which we call

301
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:31,910
nest days and control routing which mean

302
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,490
the traffic net citizen should have some

303
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,790
control over the routing of is critical

304
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,160
traffic so we see that hacking the busy

305
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,189
bee protocol by voting or organization

306
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,329
simply doesn't work and in another

307
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:49,009
extreme we may have to clean slate

308
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:51,589
Internet our teachers nice try and

309
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:54,019
Zipporah however they they are too

310
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:57,259
costly to deploy so as you can see from

311
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,170
here we believe they pay between these

312
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:02,269
two extreme and for example if we can

313
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,639
make some minimal change to the BGP

314
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,980
protocol that supports some simple

315
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,230
feature lie especially allow the

316
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,569
rerouting for the destination to control

317
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,420
the critical flow and there's some

318
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:18,889
emergency situation under DDoS attacks

319
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,240
then it could be extremely helpful from

320
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,069
our studies we have learned two

321
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,809
important lessons first

322
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:26,509
hacking the current internet routing

323
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:29,209
your fault ideas because adaptive

324
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:32,600
attacks are possible and it's mitigation

325
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:35,599
DeHart but that tip defense is slower

326
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,050
than adaptive attackers we have also in

327
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,980
the paper

328
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,829
and perhaps more importantly the second

329
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,279
lesson is that an analysis of the

330
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:48,748
protocol specification

331
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:51,569
alone insufficient and the protocol

332
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:53,279
specification it is implementation and

333
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,889
the configuration impacts it may be

334
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,350
totally different and especially in some

335
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,569
system like PCP as we saw earlier we

336
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,499
observe their coin last graph between

337
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:05,279
the trees

338
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:07,999
so in conclusion little learning attacks

339
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,100
are effective and how to mitigate

340
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:14,519
therefore unfortunately the chances

341
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,860
limit of 16 women an open problem and we

342
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,420
suggest the future dozen for

343
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,339
transitioning leaders defense into

344
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,878
balance between the testers and control

345
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:25,980
routing and the deploy abilities and

346
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,459
finally we have learned two important

347
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,949
lesson

348
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:31,559
hacking PCP for rerouting your flawed

349
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:34,800
ideas and analysis with specification

350
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,839
alone can be dancers and that's one for

351
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:44,790
my presentation today money be mutual I

352
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:54,389
would be happy to take questions we have

353
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:56,160
time for questions to be as finished

354
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,319
here Delft really

355
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,579
how does your work relate to all the

356
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:02,279
work and sentiment measurement community

357
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:05,668
on BGP black howling to defend against

358
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,890
it awesome oh I'm sorry I didn't catch

359
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,569
no question can you how does your work

360
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,030
relate to all the work in the internet

361
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,809
measurement community on BGP black

362
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,329
howling to defend against de dos also

363
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:20,280
for the internet like also we owe it so

364
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,948
you are asking about the I'm asking

365
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:28,439
about BGP black howling to defend

366
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:32,730
against DDoS also so internet like

367
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:36,179
holding unite you use your PCB poisoning

368
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,490
to lie or absorb the traffic attack

369
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,809
traffic is as what you mean yes to know

370
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,600
out at like

371
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:48,799
Tier one and IX piece but if you want we

372
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,799
can take this offline thank you

373
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:57,399
very Beverly Marquette University your

374
00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:00,310
methodology to find the detour path does

375
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,010
it make the assumption that the path the

376
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:06,760
data path from the botnet to the

377
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:10,360
destination is the same as the path from

378
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:14,400
the destination to the botnet no we made

379
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:17,439
no assumption on on the on that so the

380
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,990
topic is a part between the from the

381
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,170
botnet to the destination and the other

382
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,820
way around can be different so the

383
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,920
traceroute rule will tell you the data

384
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,510
path from the botnet to the distance yes

385
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,490
correct which could be the different

386
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,500
from the trace route that the

387
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:37,960
destination would do to the botnet yes

388
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,520
the korok thank you another round of

389
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,980
applause for speaker thank you my

390
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,980
[Applause]
