1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,830
all right thanks guys

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,289
welcome to the

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:22,150
anniversary conference I think I hope

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:29,840
the slides are coming up here perfect

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:31,909
one back perfect okay so on behalf of

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,040
Hohokam who is at the University of

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,620
Texas in Austin and myself welcome to

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,610
the Technical Program of the conference

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,870
I'll walk you a little bit through the

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,110
number of submissions and and how the

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,750
process worked as well as the work that

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,210
our reviewers put into this in this

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,729
program and then I'll touch a little bit

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,690
on the dual track setup that we have

15
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:58,369
here for the first time in Oakland so

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,129
there have been two significant changes

17
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:05,900
of the reviewing process with the 2008

18
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:08,658
symposium and it sounds or it feels much

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,840
long ago but it has just been about 18

20
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,530
month when we changed his review process

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,780
to include two innovations first we

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,189
wanted to switch to a monthly submission

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,829
system where instead of having one

24
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:26,000
deadline we would have one deadline

25
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:28,520
every month and with the 2019 symposium

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,850
we actually had the first full year of

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,798
that system with the first deadline or

28
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,579
the first submission deadline in January

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:41,329
2018 and then the last one in December

30
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:43,428
2018 and the second change that we did

31
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,869
was introducing a revised option where

32
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:46,999
papers were not immediately either

33
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,890
accepted or rejected but there was a

34
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:51,770
third option which was called revise or

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,909
a revision where we felt that the paper

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,340
had a really good strong technical

37
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,229
content but something was missing maybe

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,819
there was a piece of evaluation or maybe

39
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,189
some technical parts were not hundred

40
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:07,429
percent clear and so we would ask the

41
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:10,310
author's to improve and resubmit their

42
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:14,180
paper and then it would be reviewed by

43
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:17,180
the same pc members and then either

44
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,280
accepted in its improved version or were

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,400
rejected and i think when you look at

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,530
the motivation that we gave when we set

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,530
out to do this we wanted to basically

48
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,830
gave authors the community more chances

49
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,410
to

50
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,060
meet papers when the papers were ready

51
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,040
rather than having a system where you

52
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,170
had to submit to one of the four

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,359
conferences essentially every three

54
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,950
month and then there was this crunch

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,210
time when you got the notification of

56
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,670
the previous conference and had to

57
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,890
immediately resubmit to the next one or

58
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,200
many people did and we wanted to also

59
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,519
improve the quality of the papers and

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,429
the review process and I think overall

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,920
the these changes have been really well

62
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,660
accepted and were a really great success

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,640
also when you look at the other

64
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,880
conferences in our community that have

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,070
moved in that direction I think many

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,840
other conferences are thinking about or

67
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,640
have already implemented multiple

68
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,430
submission deadlines and they have

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,609
started to look at revise options as

70
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,040
well so I think it was a great

71
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,260
experiment but an experiment that really

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,840
worked out well so how did that

73
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,179
translate is this full year of the new

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,750
review process into the papers we

75
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,490
received the 673 total submissions it's

76
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,110
another record year for our conference

77
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,380
and here you see how the submissions

78
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,239
were divided up over the month and what

79
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm particularly happy here to see is

80
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,090
that the submissions started to spread

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,370
out especially compared to the previous

82
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,620
year where you see here the orange ones

83
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,709
there were only six submission deadlines

84
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,470
but it was very very tail-heavy in 2018

85
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,000
where most of the papers two-thirds of

86
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:01,220
the papers came in in November and

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,080
December and this year in 2004 2019 it

88
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,640
changed they did not change completely

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,670
so it's not a uniform distribution

90
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,190
obviously but we've really seen the

91
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,769
number of papers being distributed more

92
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,390
evenly over the different month and

93
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,570
that's definitely something that we want

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,029
to see and we hope to see even more

95
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,340
going forward as people finish their

96
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,289
work and actually submit it when it's

97
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,599
ready and not when there's an opportune

98
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,040
moment and you feel like hey in Oakland

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,710
paper that should be submitted in

100
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,260
October November so we are really seeing

101
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,070
those submissions starting to spread out

102
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,080
nicely all right so from these 673

103
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,849
submissions how did we end up in the

104
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,390
program with with our program with those

105
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,550
85

106
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,150
or papers that you will see over the

107
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,920
next few days well in most conferences

108
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,200
or in the past was very simple a number

109
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,170
of papers were submitted you accepted a

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,300
few and you rejected a lot and that was

111
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,190
your program but here it was different

112
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,840
because of the revision options right so

113
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,790
we of course had papers that were

114
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,010
directly accepted into the program and

115
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,630
out of 673 submissions these were

116
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:09,230
fifty-two papers that were directly

117
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:12,680
accepted and in addition we had 574

118
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,210
rejects however as I mentioned there was

119
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,690
this third option which is the revised

120
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,419
option and indeed 47 papers received a

121
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,000
revised decision and those authors could

122
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,950
decide within a certain period of time 3

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,360
months if they wanted to resubmit or not

124
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:32,060
and in fact out of these 47 papers 31

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,800
decided to resubmit the number sounds

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,410
low but you have to keep in mind that

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
folks that were submitting their papers

128
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,830
later in the year October November

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,930
December when they got a revised

130
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,909
decision they had the option to submit

131
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,570
at the later time that would be eligible

132
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,580
for the 2020 symposium so these 16

133
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,450
papers are not sort of out of the race

134
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,419
they might be accepted to for the 2020

135
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,400
symposium so we had these 31 resubmitted

136
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,070
revisions but of course we also got

137
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,049
revised papers from the previous from

138
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,349
2018 from the previous year so there

139
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,110
were 10 additional papers that were

140
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,960
resubmitted for consideration for the

141
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,830
2019 conference and for from from these

142
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,640
41 papers we actually accepted 32 and we

143
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,919
rejected nine and those 32 accepted

144
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,780
papers from the revisions and the

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,630
additional 52 papers that were straight

146
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,390
accepted give us the 84 papers that you

147
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,159
see in the program today and if you look

148
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,250
at the acceptance rate that's about a

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,950
12.5 percent acceptance rate and you

150
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,680
also see which I find interesting and

151
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,840
also importance that more than a third

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,470
almost 40% of the papers that are in

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,599
today's program or in this conferences

154
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,600
program have actually undergone a

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,610
revision process so in principle they

156
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,990
should be better than they would have

157
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,920
been if you would have just straight

158
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,870
accepted them

159
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,730
you know as the typical except if room

160
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,710
panic at the last minute and you just

161
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,900
pushed him over so you actually had the

162
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,370
chance to give the office a chance to

163
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,530
improve and revise their their

164
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,960
manuscripts so how do these numbers

165
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:13,880
compare to to previous years so here is

166
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,700
the strong growth of the numbers of

167
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,130
submissions that you can see from 2018

168
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,140
to 2019 where there was about another

169
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,350
increase of 30% of the number of

170
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,650
submissions and when you look at to 27%

171
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,440
when you look at the acceptance rates

172
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:32,690
we've really been very stable very

173
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,860
steady in a corridor between 12 and 14

174
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:39,680
percent over the last 10 plus years so

175
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:44,330
the conference is as competitive as ever

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:48,050
and we just have more submissions and as

177
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:53,750
a result many more papers that we want

178
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,670
to fit into into our program so when we

179
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,230
look at of course the other side of the

180
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,120
coin so we looked at the papers that

181
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,880
were submitted there has been a lot of

182
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,870
work done on behalf of the reviewers the

183
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,580
PC we had a fairly large PC definitely

184
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,770
for Auckland standards it was the

185
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,500
biggest PC ever with hundred six PC

186
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,900
members we reviewed most papers with

187
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,080
three or more reviews which led to

188
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,299
almost 2000 reviews which is a huge

189
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,039
amount and again an increase of almost

190
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,250
400 compared to last year

191
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,070
however we managed to keep the load

192
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,590
somewhat constant for these pc members

193
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,960
so media average was very similar is 18

194
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,949
reviews per PC member very much like

195
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,780
last year and still a significant

196
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,330
smaller number than a twenty four papers

197
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,780
that folks had to review two years ago

198
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,950
so we're fairly happy with the workload

199
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,079
although it was not as evenly

200
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,020
distributed maybe there were some PC

201
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,760
members that did more than 18 and I'm

202
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,300
very grateful for them it's still I

203
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,580
think is a is a lower number than it was

204
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,349
in the past and you know lots of words

205
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,290
were written more than a million words

206
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,230
in the reviews thousands of online

207
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,719
comments when we discussed the papers

208
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,750
all papers were not only discuss

209
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,020
offline but we had every month an online

210
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:18,710
PC meeting call where we discussed the

211
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:22,010
papers in person among the PC members

212
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:25,160
and enter chairs so there was a lot of

213
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,020
work done online as well as offline with

214
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,910
these thousands of reviews and a lot of

215
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,970
the reviews were also of course added to

216
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:36,170
to the threads to the discussion threads

217
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,580
for for those revised papers so I'm very

218
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,890
happy about the work that was done this

219
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,780
is a screenshot from hot hot crap you

220
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,780
can see the red line these little bumps

221
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,030
they happen to be monthly spaced apart

222
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,800
because every time there is a you know a

223
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,630
review deadline for the monthly cycle

224
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,400
you see the bump when everybody gets

225
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:58,280
active so it was a nice nice to see and

226
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,650
you see the gray and the yellow pools of

227
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:06,680
reviewers that were in odd and even

228
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:10,250
numbers of month and as usual with these

229
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,900
conferences reviews are very tough this

230
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,910
is a distribution of the overall merit

231
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,449
scores in the reviews so you can see

232
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,430
from one which is a strong reject to

233
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,830
three which is a weak reject four-week

234
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,680
accept and seeks strong accept you can

235
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:27,170
see most reviews are as usual on the

236
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,920
negative side and we had a total of 10

237
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:34,130
out of those 2000 reviews that actually

238
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,360
were advocating strong accept which if

239
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,600
you read it it says this is the

240
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,090
strongest paper in my pile so okay

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,550
10 10 of those which is great and if you

242
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,590
look at the distribution of the the

243
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:49,579
average scores for submissions here

244
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:52,190
grouped by buckets you can see most of

245
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:56,450
the papers are falling on the left side

246
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:58,610
so between 1 and and 3.5 3.5 being

247
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,290
exactly the the middle point between

248
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,930
sort of the week except and the week

249
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,569
reject so if you take that as the bar so

250
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:09,050
at least the score is is over 3.5 so

251
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,450
more on the accept side we have a fairly

252
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,089
small number here that in essence are

253
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,690
above the bar I think it's about about a

254
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:20,410
hundred papers so a very competitive

255
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,840
conference and

256
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,089
a lot of folks of course submitted great

257
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,200
work and it was a difficult work for the

258
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:32,440
PC to make those choices and well if you

259
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,030
look at this and Marcus mentioned it and

260
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,700
I've mentioned it we had a significant

261
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,130
increase of the number of papers 21 more

262
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,660
papers and because of this and the

263
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,920
constraints of having a three-day

264
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,339
conference we were forced to switch to a

265
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,520
dual track setup so you will see that

266
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,260
Marcus mentioned that that after we're

267
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,689
done here with what is called the video

268
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,340
preview session we will split this big

269
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,800
room into two rooms and we'll have two

270
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,470
sessions the first two sessions start at

271
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,530
10:00 a.m. they are on Hydra security

272
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,110
and cryptography and in order to somehow

273
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,060
compensate a little bit for for the

274
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,430
disadvantages with dual-track program

275
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,050
which is you can't see all the papers

276
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,209
and all the presentations anymore I

277
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,969
think a lot of work has been done to try

278
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,940
to alleviate that that disadvantage and

279
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,200
one of course is all the talks or

280
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,880
whenever the authors allow us the talks

281
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,880
who are recorded and you can view them

282
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,689
but we've also asked authors to prepare

283
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,030
a short teaser video a one-minute teaser

284
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,760
video about their work that you can

285
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,350
watch and hopefully decide based on

286
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,390
these videos if you want to see a

287
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,030
particular paper in a particular session

288
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,760
and we will show those they're called

289
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:49,209
talk previews short videos you see them

290
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,240
in your program every day starting at

291
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,730
8:50 I think for 30 minutes until 9:20

292
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,920
and they will happen here so you can

293
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,000
come in here and before the actual

294
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,370
sessions start you can enjoy the

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,740
one-minute fast pitches of the authors

296
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,380
who have prepared those video talks and

297
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,110
hopefully that will give you still an

298
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,000
overview of what's going on in the

299
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,250
community as a whole what people are

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,190
working on as a whole and then based on

301
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,340
your interests you can pick the talks

302
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:23,380
that interest you the most and look look

303
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,320
up the the talks in a program and then

304
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,510
go to the to the proper room so I'm very

305
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,700
excited about this this huge increase in

306
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,480
record number of papers and the talk

307
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,800
previews that we have and and I think

308
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,449
there are a number of other points that

309
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,579
are worth mentioning Marcus mentioned a

310
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,560
few already so I'll just point out too

311
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,420
tomorrow in the morning we talked about

312
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,550
the distinct will award the

313
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,769
distinguished papers and also reviewer

314
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,469
Awards and unlike in some other

315
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:51,930
conferences the awardees actually do not

316
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,820
know that they have been chosen so if

317
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,910
you if you think I don't have to show up

318
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,589
because nobody has told me that is not a

319
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,300
good reason because you might actually

320
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,670
give you the award and it would be said

321
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,040
if you are not here to actually receive

322
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,389
it so please come tomorrow morning for

323
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,920
the distinguished paper and review

324
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:12,630
reviewer Awards and and also check out

325
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,750
the business meeting which happens

326
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:20,279
tomorrow 6:30 because we talked about

327
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,570
important aspects for our community how

328
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,519
this conference should be organized

329
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,790
maybe changes that come up in the in the

330
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,810

331
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,510

332
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,369

334
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,880
business meeting it's open to everybody

335
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,560
it's not you know a secret society that

336
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,839
makes all these decisions it's a

337
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,930
community decision and we would really

338
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,569
value your appearance participation and

339
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:52,529
engagement there all right

340
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:54,089
with that I'm just thinking oops the red

341
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,579
button that's supposed to blow up

342
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:59,069
everything doesn't work okay with that I

343
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,430
want to thank of course all the authors

344
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:05,250
without everybody who wrote a paper and

345
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,189
submitted it that that conference would

346
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,930
not happen of course all the folks who

347
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,660
have been accepted and come here as

348
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,760
speakers thank you very much all the

349
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,410
attendees here I really want to thank

350
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,149
you organizing committee and mark

351
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,189
specifically he kept us all on track

352
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,490
it's a it's an amazing amount of work

353
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,800
and he was really I think the reason why

354
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,529
all this will is happening and will

355
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,269
happen very smoothly and really big

356
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,130
thank you to the program committee and

357
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,370
the external reviewers I know this was

358
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,050
tough on some of the PC members every

359
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,579
month the submission deadline is great

360
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,649
for the authors but there's the other

361
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:42,420
side of the coin which is the poor PC

362
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,800
members that have to then actually

363
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,920
spring into action

364
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,469
pretty much over the entire years or

365
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,939
every two three days something is

366
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,459
happening either you have to bid for

367
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,959
papers or you have to you know look at

368
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,849
the papers and review them and then you

369
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,099
have to discuss them and then you have

370
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,949
to jump on the telephone conference so

371
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,899
every every week something is happening

372
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:05,969
and going through this entire process

373
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,970

374
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,829
