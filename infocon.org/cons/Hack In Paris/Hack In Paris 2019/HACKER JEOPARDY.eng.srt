now the way this game works if you're

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,340
not familiar they're going to be six

57
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:09,910
categories that you will be shown and

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:12,310
they see the same thing up here in the

59
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,340
six categories there are five values and

60
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,790
they pick how much they are going to bet

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,810
on every question except it's backwards

62
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:29,680
with jeopardy with jeopardy we give you

63
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:32,440
the answer and Greg is always wrong we

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,210
give you the answer and you must give

65
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:41,590
the question to that answer in the form

66
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,690
of a question if you do not use it in

67
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,950
the form of a question and I'm talking

68
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,340
to the Canadians here that's like is

69
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,470
that's it all right they gets it in

70
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,590
addition we have something else very

71
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,690
special that we began in Las Vegas 30

72
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,750
years ago and somehow we have not been

73
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,140
thrown out of Las Vegas yet they get to

74
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,850
drink beer for points so in case they

75
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:14,170
really suck and are stupid they can make

76
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:18,358
points for drinking beer now my

77
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:23,530
associates here are critical to the game

78
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:25,390
you may not start drinking yet not yet

79
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,109
you know even the Canadians can't start

80
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,260
drinking yet and my associates up here

81
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,500
yeah number one you know him is at Lin

82
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,080
tile he is also the ref the judge the

83
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,340
man behind the software he makes all

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,020
this work now

85
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:50,169
there's a very important lady up here

86
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:54,549
miss Kaley and she has only one job make

87
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:57,430
sure the beer is always rolling when

88
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,190
they have finished a beer they have to

89
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,250
take it pour it on top of their head

90
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,050
to prove that it's empty you better

91
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,390
drink all the last drops this time

92
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:13,240
because if you have not finished it

93
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:17,590
guess where it's going to the Canadians

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,920
of course so you guys will figure it out

95
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,890
and you'll see what goes on and your job

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,070
is to have a boatload of fun before we

97
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,770
have a boatload of fun on the fun boat a

98
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,390
little bit after this so for this first

99
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,919
round mr. Lynn tile may we see the

100
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,990
questions and category here are your

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:45,490
categories categories are old computers

102
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:51,480

chosen you you get to pick the first

120
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:48,690
category and amount so I'm feeling you

121
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,818
all have microphones there please make

122

say no doubt so I'm feeling old today so

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm gonna go for old computers for how

126
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,250
much let's stare at the top 100 100 old

127
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,859
computers and the answer is introduced

128
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:09,750
in August 1982 this computer quickly

129
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,940
garnered 30 to 40% market share the

130
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:21,360
whole group where's the contra 64 what

131
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:23,009
is the Commodore 64 is correct at that

132

500 gallons of floor inert to run cold

139
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:57,060
Road what is the crazy per computer what

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:08:08,669

153
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,149

total number of even prime numbers go

194
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:31,240
root what is 1 what is 1 is correct the

195
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,380
number 2 is the only even prime group

196
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,389
cold road you're in charge of the board

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,190
the number of ports can when minus P is

212
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:51,579
specified to nmap PETA

213
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:51,579
what is 65535 what is 65535 is correct

214
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,980
let's hear it for him all right Peeta

215
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:08,920
Peeta will take in map for 400 please

216
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:11,560
and map for 400 if - SS is specified the

217
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,800
packet sent by n map will be of this

218
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:23,829
type Peeta what is sin

219
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:25,870
what is sin is correct Peeta way ahead

220
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:28,180
way ahead early in the game where are

221
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:35,079
you going in met for 300 please and map

222
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:38,979
for 300 all right in a Daily Double

223

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,519
can we wager negative amounts is that

227
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,410
Alright wager one oh no and your you're

228

password here my audience what do you

233
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:18,689
think they should wager 500 500 where

234
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:24,610
the password inspection agency school

235
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:26,740
responsibility can't do it properly and

236
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,009
map will try to determine this property

237
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,380
of the host if - oh is specified what is

238
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:36,149
operating system what is operating

239
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,149
system is correct

240
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,930
we'll go ahead and clear out in map and

241
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:52,920
map for 200 please the number of hosts

242
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:55,680
that will be scanned for this range show

243
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:03,839
Club wet season when they're in and 28

244
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:06,270

show Club you're in charge of the board

246
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,760
you get to pick

247
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:15,660
I think we'd take simple math for 200

248
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:21,480
simple math for 200 the highest prime

249
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,079
number less than 100 cold roof what is

250
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:29,160
97

251
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:30,150
what is 97 is correct cold root you're

252
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,610
in charge of the board and you're

253
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,590
positive again well he's big I just in

254
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:56,580
order to do simple math for 500 simple

255
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:58,800
math for 500 this ratio these two ratios

256
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:06,330
I'm gonna need this for the rest of this

257
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,810
round I thank you this ratio count it

258
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,850
down

259
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,020
Oh cold rope I have to say this or I'll

260
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,290
grade it forever what is the golden

261
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,290
ratio what is the golden ratio is right

262
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,140
all right come on come on cook a stand

263
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,490
let's go please move it it's not to

264
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,870
ratios because the only value that

265
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,510
solves that equation is the golden ratio

266
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:35,500
what he said please pick a category

267
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:37,569
simple math 400 simple math for 400 PI

268
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:49,540
rounded eight digits to the right of the

269
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:50,830
decimal point gold roads 3.14 one not in

270
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,469
the form of a question

271
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:58,089
we gave him a mulligan it's a mulligan

01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:21,760
what is a solar flare unfortunately

956
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:25,710
that's not exactly what we were looking

957
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:29,440
for since we gave you the acronym CME so

958
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:33,370
unfortunately your wager was 100 euro

959
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,620
taking you down to 2800 so it's still

960
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:39,759
anybody's game

961
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:43,720
except for MacGyver and so the striker

962
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,370
said what is an EMP or a meteor

963
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:50,310
unfortunately no that's not what we're

964
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:52,839
looking for their wager was a lot it was

965
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:56,230
1790 taking them down to 10 euros so

hack in Paris next year and gets to play

996
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:12,750
in Vegas first category 1984 plus 10

997
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:14,670
multiple-choice I figured that it was

998
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:17,460
kind of hard for everybody so we made

999
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:19,890
this category multiple choice because we

1000
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:23,790
see how good they are and the third

1001
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:28,750
category is movies

1002
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:31,060
so Stuxnet you are closest because the

1003
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:34,090
Americans are behind in late Stuxnet

1004
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:37,810
please pick your first category will

1005
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:40,750
have 1984 plus Danforth in 1984 plus 10

1006
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:50,400

1007
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:50,400
public at $21 per share I'll me

1008

that he hacked the Gibson in hackers in

1146

1148
01:17:09,559 --> 01:17:20,800
PETA PETA PETA you talking to me oh man

01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:35,449
show them the answer what is a garbage

1151
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:37,339
file all right multiple choice yeah well

1152
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:39,348
this ended up being the category the

1153
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:43,880
answer is literally on the screen for

1154
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:46,429
all of these the approximate price of a

1155
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:51,110
fully maxed out Apple Mac Pro Mac Pro

1156
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:56,989
with no display available in fall 2019

1157
01:17:51,110 --> 01:18:02,929
stock that what is 14k what is 40k is

1158
01:17:56,989 --> 01:18:05,209
right there up the zero keep in mind

1159
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:06,949
that if you do buy the display it does

1160
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,840
not come with a stand unless you pay

1161
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:10,869
another thousand dollars no yeah

1162
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:13,599
which is a reason to drink more yeah

1163
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:17,929
everybody should be drinking at that

1164
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:19,460
Stuxnet what would you like next all

1165
01:18:17,929 --> 01:18:23,210
right we're gonna multiple-choice for

1166
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:27,070
300 the length of video uploaded to

1167
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:32,539
YouTube every minute on average in 2018

1168
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:35,650
100 300 or 500 hours Stuxnet

1169
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:38,650
what is 500 hours what is 500 hours is

1170
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:38,650
correct

1171
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:48,230
multiple choice for 400 the size and

1172
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:53,130
bytes of a single arm v8 instruction to

1173
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:58,190
four or eight Peter what is a what is

1174
01:18:53,130 --> 01:19:04,620
eight incorrect what is 4 what is four

1175
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:06,599
absolutely right and the finally clean

1176
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:09,480
we get a choice yeah you have a choice

1177
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,690
I'm thinking of multiple choice for 500

1178
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:15,000
good choice multiple choice for five the

1179
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:18,690
theoretical upper bound on cat eight

1180
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:24,140
cable bandwidth 2 megahertz to gigahertz

1181
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:34,349
or 2 terahertz Peter what is 8 gigahertz

1182
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:36,810
what is 8 gigahertz what is Tutera we

1183
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:38,580
never took our Mulligan yeah well when

1184
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:40,170
it's multiple choice and you choose one

1185
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:42,989
of the answers which is not on the

1186
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:44,400
screen that was that was not the terms

1187
01:19:42,989 --> 01:19:46,230
and conditions

1188
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:59,159
Stuxnet would you like to give it a shot

1189
01:19:46,230 --> 01:20:01,139
