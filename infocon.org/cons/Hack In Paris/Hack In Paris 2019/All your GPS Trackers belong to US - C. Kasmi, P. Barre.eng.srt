1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,610
well good morning everybody good morning

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,879
as him you made it finally

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,289
so we are happy to be here today to talk

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,289
about the work we have done with Pierre

5
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,930
related to GPS tracker technologies and

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:27,210
during this talk we will try to share

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,579
with you the fun we had when we analyzed

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,980
the security of such technologies so as

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:38,040
introduced by VIN we are a security

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,529
researcher at the mobile and telecom lab

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,289
Zenoss lab test validation labs of dark

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,930
matter and we had the third friend

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,510
walking with us in Menasha he/she wanted

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,760
to be here but she had some exams so big

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,710
up Eman and we are all with you today

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,099
let's start with the topic of today's so

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,420
GPS tracker technologies so there are

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,640
cheap devices that we can buy online and

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,060
basically they provide you specific

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,610
devices that you can put on specific for

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,610
space for specific applications

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,920
especially for expensive good tracking

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,710
people tracking if you need for example

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,590
when you have to manage cars at a lower

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:31,139
scale they are available everywhere they

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,810
provide you also mobile apps for iOS and

27
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,579
Android we have been buying a few of

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,650
them so they are here if you want to

29
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,250
have a look at one of them is in the

30
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,280
Faraday cage we have built yesterday

31
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:48,509
because we will do some live demos

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,259
during this talk basically when we

33
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,369
started working on GPS trackers it was

34
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:59,240
early 2018 we have been looking at the

35
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,799
infrastructure of GPS trackers devices

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,449
but we had no information about the

37
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,930
device we were testing so basically it

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,020
was a black box type of analysis and we

39
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,400
started with gathering information so

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,060
the first thing we have been looking at

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,810
is basically if

42
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,230
see reports were available online and we

43
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,150
had a look on the website and we found

44
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,429
basically that the tracker have been

45
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,770
evaluated from a standard as a test a

46
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,050
point of view and here for example we

47
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,780
have one of the model we have been

48
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,610
looking at in the report you have

49
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,730
everything you need to know about the

50
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,780
hardware the wireless interfaces the

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,609
network what type of sensor they enclose

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,170
what type of specific technologies they

53
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,970
may be using how they work and a lot of

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,600
information about the way you can

55
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,609
manipulate the tracker there is a lot of

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,180
interesting information related to

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,760
network network interfaces wired and

58
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,660
wireless so we will see that some of

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,149
them have interesting features and we

60
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,510
had also to work on the reverse

61
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,269
engineering of the hardware with the

62
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:17,608
support of the Asus FCC report the same

63
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:21,970
way when we were able to extract it and

64
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:25,090
web app data data put online to manage

65
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,329
the tracker remotely and also mobile

66
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,709
apps and for the web app we also had a

67
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,700
lot of fans and we will show you what

68
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,500
kind of veneer ability they have so the

69
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,480
general architecture is as follows so

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,400
basically the GPS tracker is supposed to

71
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:45,700
get the signal from the GPS satellites

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,750
then they collect the data and through

73
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,819
the mobile network they will send the

74
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,230
location periodically or on demand if

75
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,170
the user would like to request

76
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,319
especially at a specific time the

77
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,708
location of the tracker with the mobile

78
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,569
apps it's just based on sending an SMS

79
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,450
to the to the to the tracker and the

80
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:11,530
tracker automatically send back the

81
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,328
location of the tracker so the user can

82
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,489
use the web application on the

83
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:17,978
smartphone you can also directly connect

84
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,659
on the web app online and get access to

85
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:24,159
the tracker and the management interface

86
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:26,659
so as we can see here there are a lot of

87
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:28,930
point of interaction so base

88
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,120
we can use that as attack vectors

89
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,130
depending on what is the purpose of the

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:40,190
specific attacks we try to launch

91
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:41,870
against the attackers technology we were

92
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,750
not the only one working on that at the

93
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,830
same time we have seen very interesting

94
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:51,680
paper studies released online track

95
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,090
McCadden is one of them and it's

96
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,060
basically focusing on web app security

97
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:03,039
so finding vulnerabilities in management

98
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:06,710
web application provided by

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,830
manufacturers a second study which is

100
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:13,900
basically sending fake time and GPS

101
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:18,380
location to again the web web app and

102
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:22,130
also videos which was the study of the

103
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,830
most most important GPS tracker use in

104
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,630
UK where the researcher was able to

105
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,940
compromise more than ten ten thousand

106
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:34,610
devices a last interesting publication

107
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,190
published by Zak Whittaker was a study

108
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,250
from a security researcher where he was

109
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,440
exposing one of the interesting new

110
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,380
features they tend to introduce in GPS

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:50,090
trackers which are a microphone to

112
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,790
provide the user the access to the audio

113
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:58,940
environment where the location we have

114
00:05:52,790 --> 00:06:00,560
the tracker is located most of these

115
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,650
studies were have in common that they

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,169
were focusing on the web app and how to

117
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,520
compromise the tracker

118
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:15,140
location from the web interface in our

119
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:18,549
case we wanted to have a look at a more

120
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,640
attack vectors and we decided to work on

121
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:27,710
finding new vulnerabilities having fun

122
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:30,050
of you of course by trying all the

123
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,840
attack vectors we had in mind so the

124
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,690
first one was how to reverse the

125
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,650
management protocol by using a fake base

126
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,370
station then becoming active manipulate

127
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,539
minimal

128
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:48,860
the data by bypassing security features

129
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:51,590
if they exist accessing the remote

130
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,780
management server and custom protocol so

131
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,669
we had a look at what what kind of

132
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,070
vulnerabilities exists in the management

133
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:02,659
interface and how we would be able to

134
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,729
access over trackers location we also

135
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,160
had a look at the hardware security we

136
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,830
opened all the GPS tracker we have we

137
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,020
have been processing at least the one we

138
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,520
have been able to get because many of

139
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,750
those stay blocked at the custom

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,960
reversing the fem we're finding

141
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,750
vulnerabilities and also having a look

142
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,849
at the mobile apps and the web interface

143
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,169
again because they are interesting

144
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,419
features that we will talk about so we

145
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:35,990
just went online we went to Aliexpress

146
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:39,169
we took the ten most ten most popular

147
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,630
GPS trackers we finally were able to get

148
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:45,020
three seven where Ava sent back or block

149
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,960
at the custom even by sending them to

150
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,539
friends it was a little bit complex so

151
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,590
we were not able to get them but what we

152
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:56,719
have seen from a infrastructure point of

153
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,479
view all the tracker have a lot of

154
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,320
similarities at the infrastructure level

155
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:06,650
so even if there are a lot of resellers

156
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,840
the there is a specific art were sold by

157
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,650
OEM and they are used by different

158
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:16,340
resellers what they just put their own

159
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:20,030
label on them most of them are Chinese

160
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,239
and you will see that for privacy

161
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:27,219
purpose there is some question to to ask

162
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:31,160
yourself before using such technologies

163
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,919
so for starting we study at the AF

164
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,310
interface level we want it first to

165
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,279
hijack sessions to and break the a51 but

166
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,289
we found found it easier to just set up

167
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,200
our own base station and collect all the

168
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,040
data we need to stop we publish one

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,930
paper in misc

170
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,020
where we focus on the methodology we

171
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,880
applied during the research and one

172
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,930
scientific paper where we focus on the

173
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,060
privacy issues

174
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,040
introduced by GPS trackers so those

175
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,040
studies are online or in the misc Jonah

176
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:07,040
so regarding the first attack scenario

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,189
which was not written attack scenario we

178
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,099
just put our sim card in the GPS tracker

179
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,790
set up a base station as we did here and

180
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,339
we just started to get data order the

181
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:23,630
different messages sent between the

182
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:26,060
tracker and the infrastructure what we

183
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,790
have seen basically that they have very

184
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,579
old baseband so they don't support use

185
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,230
him and we spent one day just to figure

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,399
out that they don't are not able to

187
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,459
handle them here for example we will

188
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:44,029
just go on the website and register the

189
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:47,060
tracker we are we are we have on in the

190
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,279
Faraday cage and basically that's what

191
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:54,160
the user will have so he will have the

192
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,480
location it's low specific location soon

193
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,569
because we are also doing another demo

194
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,150
same time I think so we can create the

195
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:06,230
account basically the login and password

196
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:08,240
are either the ami of the of the of the

197
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,029
tracker or the serial number and the

198
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,930
password is basically the same

199
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:17,000
information and no one asked you to

200
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,579
change the password so basically if you

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,260
have one serial number you are able to

202
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,290
brute-force them because they are just

203
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,439
incremented when they are produced so

204
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,930
from that specific part we are already

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,830
able to get access to the data of a lot

206
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:36,650
of stalkers we also have seen that

207
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,529
basically the full configuration is

208
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,839
managed for SMS that we can see in clear

209
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:45,020
text and the first fail that we have

210
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,600
seen is for any SMS we sent to the

211
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:52,360
tracker the content of the SMS is sent

212
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,950
back to another to the server and and

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,589
basically to the manufacturer or the

214
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,770
tracker so he is aware of any action you

215
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,450
are doing on the tracker action that can

216
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,350
be changing the password to log the

217
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,030
tracker changing the

218
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,440
getting access to the location of the

219
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:14,079
tracker and over they tie we will see so

220
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,280
these are proprietary protocols of have

221
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:22,470
text messages in clear text and you will

222
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,470
see that the protocol is really easy so

223
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:31,030
as we said set up the BTS everyone every

224
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:35,710
security researcher now has at least one

225
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:37,150
ser we have here the blade RF with that

226
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,270
we have been able to get a lot of

227
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,030
information quickly especially about the

228
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:47,860
often authentication of Education

229
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:49,839
protocol which is really unsecure all

230
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,640
cut curves and coordinates to IPS in

231
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,920
China which is also something

232
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,939
interesting the traffic is not encrypted

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,130
and is easily detectable the password is

234
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,750
sent in clear text the serial number is

235
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,750
used as a token and it's also sent in

236
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,370
clear text the SMS configuration is

237
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,550
generic in the sense that all the

238
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:14,140
tracker we have been looking at use the

239
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:18,209
same management SMS commands so as soon

240
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,460
as you have been able to look at the

241
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:23,020
configuration mechanism it is common to

242
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,530
all tracker you will be you have you

243
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,870
will have a look at later

244
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:31,980
the only firewall the only security

245
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,780
feature that we called firewall is that

246
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,700
the tracker is locked against master

247
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,800
phone number which can be easily

248
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,660
bypassed if you are able to spoof the

249
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,290
caller ID when you send an SMS to the

250
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:47,230
tracker and the phone number Locker is

251
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:50,079
supposed to be secret but we saw that

252
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,660
the phone number for Sun tracker as soon

253
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,270
as you put the SIM card is sent to the

254
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,910
manufacturer so he is already able to

255
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:02,890
get critical information that is

256
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:09,010
supposed to be only in your hand it's

257
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:11,370
cool okay so we wanted to mainly do live

258
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,180
demo so currently we have a blade RF

259
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:18,550
this laptop is running yeah to BTS so

260
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,880
inside the Faraday cage

261
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,620
so we have a super nice setup as you can

262
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,110
see with two antennas and one GPS

263
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,720
tracker unfortunately we are not able to

264
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:33,370
get a GPS signal within the Faraday cage

265
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,400
so what we can do is just we can sniff

266
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,440
the light traffic on the GPRS interface

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,680
everything is sent to the Internet as

268
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:48,010
you can see the tracker is sending a

269
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:50,890
specific request to IP in China so cname

270
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,110
0-6 is the data center dot-com so we

271
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,060
wanted to do a live demo about that but

272
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,750
unfortunately we can do well so what we

273
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,689
can do is we can analyze other pickup

274
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,130
files so for example this kind of pickup

275
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,560
as you can see when we sniff the traffic

276
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,590
you send at first SMS to the tracker so

277
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,189
you Sandra status then we sniff the

278
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:18,150
traffic on the GPS in their face of the

279
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,770
blade RF and what is what we see is that

280
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:24,490
everything is sent to China so inside

281
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:27,250
the packet you have the serial number of

282
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:31,300
the GPS tracker the phone number of the

283
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:36,520
sender and the statues the content of

284
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:39,459
the SMS at first we were thinking we did

285
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,110
miss configuration and it appears that

286
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,110
it was not a Miss configuration

287
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:07,209
okay so this is live for this is the

288
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,210
capture of the packet

289
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:21,579
this one okay next one okay so basically

290
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,040
we wanted to replace the content of the

291
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,680
SMS and we saw that everything was being

292
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,469
sent to China so we were a bit curious

293
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,660
and basically it means that when you

294
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:35,410
want to configure a specific option like

295
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,050
a geofence of very basic option of GPS

296
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,880
tracker everything is sent to to China

297
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:46,270
even your passphrase your pin code so we

298
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,170
reverse the protocol in order to fan so

299
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:52,390
we wrote our own GPS client so basically

300
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,209
we don't need a GPS tracker anymore we

301
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,550
can send the fake information what is

302
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,250
very strange is that this IP is located

303
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,709
in China but in fact currently we are

304
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,230
look we are working in Abu Dhabi so when

305
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,720
we are trying to ping this IP we have

306
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:12,340
like nine or ten minutes gone between

307
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:16,870
this IP and our workplace which was very

308
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:18,850
suspicious so in fact this IP is a zero

309
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,390
located in China but everything is

310
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:26,320
Australian dubia we were a bit

311
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,720
suspicious about that in fact all the IP

312
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,430
range is announced by 80s a lot which is

313
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,150
the largest United Arab Emirates

314
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,760
Internet service provider that's very

315
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,640
strange so everything is sent and also

316
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:43,180
nothing is written about that in the

317
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:47,800
manual or in the privacy policy of GPS

318
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:51,579
tracker so we are currently expert so we

319
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,740
found a very good way to get SMS from

320
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,450
banking services and stuff like that so

321
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,510
currently we have this at home in France

322
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,460
and we reconfigure the management server

323
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,250
so basically it's and everything to our

324
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:06,520
server and we can use online banking

325
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,339
service also we want it to analyze this

326
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,740
IP because this IP is a bit stranger

327
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:18,349
so first things you do when you are

328
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:21,709
doing something like that is another

329
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:23,809
analyzing all the bottom so we were a

330
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,600
bit suspicious because basically you

331
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:31,668
have a lot of TCP services running on

332
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:37,330
this IP and when you want to reach this

333
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:40,820
IP over HTTPS so we will accept the risk

334
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,799
and you have this kind of website so

335
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,259
apparently it's the website for a

336
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,009
Chinese bank and if you try if you read

337
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:55,399
Chinese it ask you to this activate ipv6

338
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:58,909
and to disable your antivirus why not a

339
00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:02,870
lot of suspicious services are running

340
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:05,809
and his IP so we changed because we

341
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,620
found other interesting stuff but this

342
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:13,370
is highly suspicious and so everything

343
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:16,279
is sent to to this IP so we also analyze

344
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,809
another kind of tracker so when this

345
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,629
source of tracker is booting so

346
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:23,240
basically it will reach you blocks

347
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:25,908
server so you can find a lot on shodhan

348
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,370
and the first thing is that so we hide

349
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,470
some information it will use a specific

350
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,110
gmail account with a password account

351
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:36,080
and it will send latitude longitude and

352
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,740
altitude directly to this server very

353
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,259
strangers and then the client running on

354
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,440
the GPS tracker will reach another TCP

355
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:48,019
server and it will send information so

356
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,909
as you can see it's very straightforward

357
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:53,629
to understand everything so basically

358
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:57,230
you have in read the latitude and the

359
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:59,178
longitude in red also so now the

360
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,580
question is how does the authentication

361
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:06,529
work in both cases as you previously so

362
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,449
we didn't see password or encryption and

363
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:13,970
that's true so you don't have

364
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:17,090
authentication so what we can do we can

365
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:20,289
write a small client in term and what we

366
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,639
did is we send fake coordinates

367
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,559
specifying is that our GPS tracker is

368
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:26,689
currently located in Pyongyang so we

369
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,039
were never went to Pyongyang so we can

370
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,900
suppose that it's not legit coordinate

371
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,080
also what is very interesting

372
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,540
thing is that it's very easy to guess

373
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,270
cycle number of GPS trackers so

374
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:44,050
basically if you are a bad guy you can

375
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,700
send fake information to like hundred of

376
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,460
thousand or million of GPS trackers

377
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,110
seeing that everyone is doing a part in

378
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:58,390
conn-young maybe you like the move just

379
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,110
like the mode let's go okay so no I have

380
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:04,960
a small pant

381
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:06,969
I'm sending information so this is this

382
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,180
is your GPS tracker I hope it will work

383
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,100
because as we will see some things are

384
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,790
broken in the back end is all chinese'

385
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:18,550
infrastructure so this is the

386
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,580
information about this tracker so

387
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,800
currently it's in green it means that

388
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,040
it's getting all my information so we

389
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,790
are here let's refresh can you see it

390
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:36,310
we will refresh the webpage and well we

391
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:39,010
travel incredible super fast so now I

392
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:46,419
don't know where is a tracker traveling

393
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:49,270
having fun I hope I am yeah so you can

394
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:54,780
see we can create a fake information for

395
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:57,370
a lot of GPS tracker it was not very

396
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,490
complicated to do because you don't have

397
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:06,790
a consultation and we can analyze the

398
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:12,310
protocol very very easily now more

399
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:14,470
active radio attack you can do GPS

400
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,929
spoofing the fact is you can get a lot

401
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:20,650
of program on github and do it very

402
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:23,290
easily we were more interested in the

403
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,690
detection of GPS tracker so basically as

404
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,570
I explained before you can send specific

405
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,060
SMS to tracker and you will get

406
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,679
information back what is very

407
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,440
interesting is that a lot of commands

408
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,120
they don't require authentication

409
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,810
basically if you want to detect GPS

410
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,530
tracker using sfa sync Yana you send a

411
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,120
specific keyword to also SFF a number

412
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,280
and

413
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,830
you will get a lot of answer from angry

414
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,260
people but also from a valid GPS tracker

415
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,389
and also what is very interesting is

416
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,540
that you can really find the management

417
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:01,140
server why is it super interesting so

418
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,420
basically you can redefine this server

419
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,760
in order to do man-in-the-middle over

420
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,670
the Internet which means that from the

421
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,010
tracker you are unable to verify how to

422
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,980
check that the management server

423
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:17,100
webchange and using a balanced program

424
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,990
you just do a TCP forwarding and then it

425
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,490
will send all the information back to

426
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,960
China which means that you are doing a

427
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,910
manís amid all over the Internet and you

428
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,850
are getting all the information but also

429
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:31,020
if you are using better cap or mhm proxy

430
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:33,360
you are able to change on the fly a GPS

431
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,410
coordinate which can be a very funny to

432
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,330
do but if you want to do that use a

433
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,880
Faraday cage as you can see we have a

434
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,580
very very a fancy Faraday cage here and

435
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:50,010
don't do this at home because it can be

436
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:51,960
a bit illegal just regarding the devices

437
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,100
we have been looking at and the trends

438
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,770
in GPS tracker

439
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,669
technologies we have seen that they tend

440
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,620
to introduce a new additional sensors

441
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,600
the one on the mic with the Micra have

442
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,290
seen that they are a lot now sold with

443
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,260
the feet you have to eavesdrop the audio

444
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,800
environment movement and noise detectors

445
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,830
also that will trigger the transmission

446
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,879
of a specific location when they detect

447
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:24,840
a specific noise level we also have seen

448
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,090
that a few devices now have cameras and

449
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,480
closed in the during the device so you

450
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,030
are able to request a picture anytime

451
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,330
from do your phone and you will get it

452
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:40,649
back we also have seen additional

453
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,840
wireless interfaces the first thing will

454
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,350
be to think that they add wireless

455
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,720
interfaces to increase the connectivity

456
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,300
of the trackers which is completely

457
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,890
wrong because what they do they added a

458
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:58,800
Wi-Fi module with in a monitor mode to

459
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:02,340
collect all ap

460
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,510
AP parameters and they sent that that

461
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:09,899
back also in China so we can think about

462
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:11,700
cars having GPS trackers equivalent to

463
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,270
the Google car that collect all

464
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,340
information and sent them back to China

465
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,980
so it increased the attack so fast but

466
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,870
it also increased the capabilities of

467
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,050
the tracker which is a scanning for

468
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:32,280
access point in the vicinity of the GPS

469
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:35,610
tracker so again what we have seen on

470
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,860
with the devices we have tested so free

471
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,709
GPS trackers three different backends

472
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:44,969
but a lot of similarities on the

473
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:47,490
advocacy level the Chinese IPS that are

474
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,580
exposed by the devices are located in

475
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,850
China we found her in also some of them

476
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:57,710
in Germany and the one we saw in the UAE

477
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,899
with this crazy banking website

478
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,730
presented to a user

479
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,160
we have reverse-engineered all the

480
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,010
protocols so that this is down we are

481
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:13,860
able to analyze and detect at the

482
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:16,470
network level any GPS tracker traffic at

483
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,080
the ISP level we think that it's super

484
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,160
easy to detect the presence of GPS

485
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:27,240
trackers as it's really easy to detect

486
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:30,590
specific messages from the network side

487
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,170
so and they also got can get the

488
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,949
coordinates and modify them if needed to

489
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:40,560
protect the information the the critical

490
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:45,540
infrastructure that these companies are

491
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,800
able to map today in the same time we

492
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,600
have seen that they are interesting

493
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,580
api's and now we will switch to

494
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:55,230
interesting vulnerabilities we have

495
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,210
found in the in the web apps so

496
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,740
basically this is a website as you can

497
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,450
see we have a lot of functionalities

498
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,840
what is very interesting is that you

499
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,400
have access to a lot of different API is

500
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,500
allowing you to get history of the

501
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,070
tracker to define geofence and to get

502
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:14,070
funny thing but before showing

503
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,000
this kind of information let's speak

504
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,750
about adware

505
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,360
so oh we also analyzed the hardware of

506
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:25,680
the GPS tracker so mainly you have two

507
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,600
different GPS chips you blocks a very

508
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,270
common and sim come from a Chinese

509
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,290
company so you support GPS GLONASS

510
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:39,480
Galileo we found a lot of flash memory

511
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:42,450
of four megabytes mainly with a erm CPU

512
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,450
on the motherboard so we didn't find

513
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:49,680
protection against physical attack you

514
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:52,290
have uart port everywhere you have jitta

515
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,710
so why we are doing that we were mainly

516
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:59,879
interesting to found hidden commands and

517
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:03,330
potential backdoors so basically we dump

518
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,090
everything and then we analyze so it's

519
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:10,230
very straightforward we load the binary

520
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,629
with in Ryder Pro we found nucleus F to

521
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,590
us which is a real-time operating system

522
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:20,340
and we were interesting in finding

523
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:23,970
backdoor SMS commands so that was not a

524
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:26,550
big success basically we found different

525
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:29,760
commands for different a network

526
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:32,370
protocol but a lot of SMS commands are

527
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,390
not enabled so it was not a very big

528
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:40,169
success but also what we found is that

529
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:42,480
when you pass stuff normally you can do

530
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:46,070
a lot of error so we were interested in

531
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,050
sending bad information over SMS and

532
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,720
also you have a client running on the

533
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,210
GPS tracker in order to contact to reach

534
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,200
the management protocol so it means that

535
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:01,980
you have a passing of information also

536
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:05,670
some trackers supporting HTTP protocol

537
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,580
so they were in which very specific HTTP

538
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:11,280
server and do passing of text file this

539
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,399
one is very interesting because but it

540
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,139
clean no one try to analyze this kind of

541
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,540
security and if you can do a

542
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:24,190
man-in-the-middle you can send specific

543
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:26,080
HTTP packet and crashes GPS tracker or

544
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,379
so when during the reverse engineering

545
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,158
we didn't found anything about a few my

546
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:34,959
holidays which means that if you found a

547
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,330
remote code execution or something like

548
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,279
that basically you can't patch so you

549
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:44,649
put everything to the trash and you buy

550
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:47,649
a new GPS tracker then we also spoke a

551
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:51,309
bit about different clients so we also

552
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:55,090
have ios and android client at first we

553
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:58,269
used static analysis using jeddaks for

554
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:02,379
the android client so we add

555
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:05,860
authentication first time yes in order

556
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:07,809
to get access to API access so this one

557
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,918
we were very surprised to see that you

558
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:15,009
have authentication but the fact is when

559
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,690
you are authenticated then you have a

560
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:21,309
session the problem is that the session

561
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:23,110
is not linked to your GPS tracker which

562
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:25,750
means that you can fetch information

563
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,539
about all the GPS tracker so if an

564
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:31,240
attacker about GPS tracker you will get

565
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:34,389
validation and xeni can type information

566
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,750
about all the other GPS tracker also

567
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:40,899
everything is done over HTTP so we try

568
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:43,240
to found a vulnerability so if I want to

569
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:46,539
insecurity wrecked object references so

570
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,570
you can dump also database but it was

571
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:52,570
already found by another team a pair up

572
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,120
in the same time and they already are

573
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:59,379
each different from those and nothing

574
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:03,820
was done also we have access to specific

575
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:07,449
API website so this one as you can see

576
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:10,149
this is a super API web page explaining

577
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,250
explaining you everything so you can

578
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:14,860
craft your request and by default

579
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,070
activate hit debug so here you have the

580
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,330
definition or all the API

581
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,769
Viper's everything you can do which is

582
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,360
super cool so you can try to find good

583
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:29,409
stuff but the fact is that it was

584
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:33,428
already public so we didn't continue in

585
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:37,179
this way also you have access to the

586
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:38,630
website so basically the website it

587
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:41,820
allows you to

588
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,600
define a lot of functionalities so you

589
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,610
have live information about speed

590
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,469
location you can replay so if you have

591
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:52,668
access to also history of people it's

592
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:55,320
very interesting and also you have

593
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:58,710
geofence definition so geofence is

594
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:02,899
something you defined around gps tracker

595
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:07,620
and if the gps tracker is going outside

596
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:09,870
this area you will get alert so you will

597
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,399
get a left using SMS or push on

598
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:17,158
application this is a very good idea but

599
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,830
the problem is this functionality

600
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,799
basically can be linked with the online

601
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:26,039
so if the car is going outside the

602
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,750
geofence area you will come a shutdown

603
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:30,360
so it's not a good idea

604
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,029
we also found vulnerabilities allowing

605
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,449
anyone to different geo things around

606
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:39,840
your GPS tracker so it's not very good

607
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:41,940
implementation and also it blindly trust

608
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,949
GPS information which means that if you

609
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,960
are going out to the periphery and you

610
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,940
send a fake GPS information you may have

611
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,700
fun but you can do it because it's

612
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:55,080
illegal let's do a demo about your fans

613
00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:01,549
so for example this one we have a

614
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:08,240
webpage so you can define geofence

615
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:08,240
around this test

616
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,960
test test at success yes so I defined a

617
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:20,370
very small geofence so we also have

618
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:23,159
another device hop this is also ours so

619
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,080
as you can see I was logged with my

620
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,809
account and I got access to another

621
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,178
account which is corresponding to our to

622
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:37,408
a GPS we are so we can define a new

623
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:42,299
geofence HIV HIV and giant I want to be

624
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:44,549
free yes and it works so basically we

625
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,150
define the geofence for another GPS

626
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:50,250
tracker this is a very good idea the

627
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,919
problem is the implementation is very

628
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,070
bad also authentication in fact in the

629
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,120
web on the website is a very bad

630
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,428
basically if you have the same number

631
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,379
the password will be also the serial

632
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:03,780
number or one two three four five six

633
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,500
and basically no one is changing as this

634
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:10,379
kind of password finally I didn't speak

635
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:15,030
about it but you also have access to a

636
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:20,400
history so it's very interesting this

637
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:23,520
vulnerability was existing two or three

638
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,360
months ago and you have access to a lot

639
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:30,900
of very interesting information you want

640
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,000
to speak about it yeah we can just for

641
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:36,720
example here we have found a GPS tracker

642
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,289
that was used in Netherland and tracker

643
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,299
was going to a specific ambassy every

644
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:45,450
morning and going back home every

645
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:48,570
evening so it shows that the device is

646
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:50,940
really is used also a lot in Europe we

647
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,309
found also some of them in France but as

648
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,679
it's started to be more offensive

649
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,690
research we decided to stop we try to

650
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,940
inform the vendor but it was really

651
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,429
difficult to get in touch with them we

652
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,000
don't know what they were doing but when

653
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:07,590
we released the paper three months ago

654
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,500
we have seen that what a part of the

655
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,549
infrastructure and this specific part is

656
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,719
not working anymore

657
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,129
so we don't see them patching things we

658
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,560
just see that it's broken so every

659
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:23,850
someone is playing with it or they just

660
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:26,429
don't have good software developers

661
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:29,009
and the question about DGP are we leave

662
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:33,210
that for experts but we have the feeling

663
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:36,810
that it's not really a compliant so just

664
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,720
to conclude this talk we had a lot of

665
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:42,299
fun we hope that you also had a lot

666
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:45,330
others we did the blackbox analysis of

667
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,940
devices the device are used everywhere

668
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:51,179
and they are still available accessible

669
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:55,350
so it seems that anyone using the device

670
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:58,350
should just remove it from his car the

671
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:01,440
cell IDs are also collected with the GPS

672
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,390
coordinate so all the manufacturer are

673
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,310
half today

674
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:10,020
the map of telecom infrastructure in all

675
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:13,410
over the world because we found the

676
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,840
tracker everywhere it's a very

677
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,109
interesting topic because for us it

678
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,820
becomes like a CTF style research where

679
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,930
we did reverse engineering network

680
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,840
analysis radio analysis and there is a

681
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:31,020
lot of work to be done and we hope that

682
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,550
people will also work on it and we thank

683
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,710
you very much for your attention and if

684
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:45,340
you have any question please let us know

685
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:45,340
