1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:11,740
good morning everybody welcome to

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,350
exploits in wet we're really glad to be

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,259
here this is gonna focus on more of the

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:21,279
human element of hacking yeah who knows

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,140
what this picture is anybody okay a

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,500
couple people good so this is a picture

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,109
from Def Con Vegas this is the SC social

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,880
engineering village and that's where a

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,070
lot of this material came from I

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,839
competed there for two years and then

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,449
I've been using a lot of this in my work

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,180
as well over the last couple of years so

13
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:42,849
it's really a combination of real world

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,769
experience and then also this CTF which

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,989
actually targets real companies so a

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,520
good mixture of both there if you're

17
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,800
interested in social engineering I

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,500
highly recommend you take a look at this

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,940
event it's really exciting I'll speak a

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,100
little bit about it in this presentation

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,289
but if you want to go and compete there

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,640
let me know and I'm happy to work

23
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,190
through it with you and give you my

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,539
material and talk about it at more depth

25
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,610
on what you can do there so just a quick

26
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:11,890
little bit about me so I've been working

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,740
in the industry for about twenty years

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,929
I do a lot of volunteer experience in

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,149
search and rescue so I'm a tracker for

30
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:22,030
about ten years and why that's relevant

31
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:24,429
is because it's very very similar to how

32
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,039
we do Oh sent as far as looking for sign

33
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:29,170
and Intel and stuff like that I'm also

34
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,819
the founder of trace labs so I don't

35
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,709
know if you've seen that here yet yeah

36
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,709
we just had a mini documentary that was

37
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:37,750
launched and it's on YouTube so if you

38
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:41,550
google trace labs you'll you'll see that

39
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,289
we do Oh since CTF for missing people

40
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,479
and that's my contact information so if

41
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:48,550
you have any questions or

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,010
recommendations on this presentation

43
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,350
please let me know

44
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,210
alright so there's a lot of great things

45
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,350
going on here today so I want to kind of

46
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,419
give you an overview of what I'll be

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,910
going through to make sure that matches

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:07,000
your expectations this is a basic agenda

49
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,680
all right I have to do this slide none

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,230
of the information I present here today

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,570
in any way represents any company that

52
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,170
I've worked for now in the past or in

53
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:21,820
the future okay let's get into social

54
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,809
engineering a brief introduction so this

55
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,000
gets tricky

56
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,620
it used to be very binary very

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,570
black-and-white to me what social

58
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,920
engineering was all about I would say

59
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,390
the difference between social

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,130
engineering and say influence would be

61
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,929
you could influence somebody and it

62
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,430
would be in their best interest you

63
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,340
would be helping the person where is

64
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,530
social engineering is typically a

65
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,840
manipulation so you're doing something

66
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,210
that's not in their best interest

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,980
however over the last few years I've

68
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,710
discovered that there's a lot of gray

69
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,200
area for example what if you do nothing

70
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,870
and then the person does something for

71
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,429
you or gives you some information that

72
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,440
you didn't ask for you just didn't tell

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,700
them not to right so there's it's really

74
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,920
interesting that as we progress with

75
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,530
social engineering it's viewed as very

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,690
negative but there's degrees of

77
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,640
negativity there so it's I'm getting

78
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,170
into that more and more and if you want

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,279
to talk later about that that's a

80
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,230
fascinating subject so some examples of

81
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,530
social engineering so these are some of

82
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,709
the older ones that we see we still see

83
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,810
these unfortunately right so things like

84
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,570
impersonation that's where I dress up as

85
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,090
maybe the janitor or somebody who does

86
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,340
services in your building and I walk in

87
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,750
and pretend I'm somebody else so we see

88
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,730
this quite a bit still it's very

89
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,989
effective for your physical pentesters

90
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:46,869
you can be Pizza Delivery FedEx anything

91
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:49,840
like that tailgating we still see that

92
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,330
still very effective if you want to get

93
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,010
into a building carry a bunch of donuts

94
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,400
or a bunch of coffees or anything like

95
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,899
that nine times out of ten people are

96
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,870
still very eager to help you come

97
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,489
through the door shoulder surfing we see

98
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,510
this a little bit less now because of

99
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,069
the protective screen

100
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,010
and the new technology that's out there

101
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,689
to help with that but it is still still

102
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,700
a concern there was a story in the news

103
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,489
not too long ago about a person on a bus

104
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,810
where that information was viewed from

105
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,030
people behind them so it's still going

106
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,339
on dumpster diving is a little bit

107
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,190
better we shred a lot of our information

108
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,020
now but it's still there's still a lot

109
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,580
of availability there for for data

110
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,219
breach current attacks so this is

111
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,948
changing fairly quickly but it's still a

112
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,139
numbers game right so we see high volume

113
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,139
for these sort of attacks with an

114
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,479
expectation of say you know one to ten

115
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,160
percent success rate so we see the

116
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,710
phishing the phishing the smishing of

117
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,330
course right that's nonstop it's getting

118
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,190
better and better some of its getting

119
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,919
more targeted and some of it especially

120
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,680
for whaling is becoming more more of a

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,960
combination attack of course as a

122
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,220
service social engineering as a service

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,888
especially for the fishing and fishing

124
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,539
services everything is as a service now

125
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:07,690
you can get your denial of service as a

126
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:09,370
service even so we're seeing more of

127
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,440
that and then the social media

128
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,849
impersonation fake accounts to harvest

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,419
credentials I had this the other day

130
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:18,370
where you're in the lineup for to get

131
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,870
your rental car and the lineup is long

132
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,580
so you get on Twitter and you start to

133
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,680
complain to the company you say oh I've

134
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,659
been waiting an hour you get a tweet

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,010
back that says oh so sorry

136
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,300
click this link and put in your

137
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,060
information will give you a free credit

138
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,650
well it's not really that company it's

139
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,800
it's a fake company so what's next

140
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,659
all sorts of good stuff is coming our

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,030
way with these attacks and these are

142
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,620
actually these are a lot of these are

143
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,049
happening right now right so virtual

144
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,460
kidnapping take your account I can do

145
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,330
all sorts of things with your account

146
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,820
once I've got it

147
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,710
wailing of course your executive so

148
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,020
those are really the high-value targets

149
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,698
and so there's a lot more energy put

150
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,320
into that saffron Rhodes was a good

151
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,669
example of that I believe that was last

152
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,590
year one of my favorites is the pseudo

153
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,049
ransom or hybrid attack where really

154
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,549
it's just a distraction so if I want to

155
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,520
attack your company I know you have

156
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,260
resources in your company to defend but

157
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,049
you only have so many so you might have

158
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,199
10 people in your blue team or

159
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,180
are doing operational security so if I

160
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,509
distract them keep them busy that's

161
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,069
gonna be great for the real attack right

162
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,500
professional Network solicitation so

163
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,680
this is very popular I seen a little bit

164
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,330
less this year than last year but the

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,310
solicitation the flat flattering of your

166
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,599
skill set saying oh you are awesome at

167
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,210
this you're exactly what we're looking

168
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:43,169
for would you like to come to come to

169
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,849
our country or do an interview with us

170
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,359
headhunters and Conference invites as

171
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,580
well

172
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:55,509
thousands talent program it was very

173
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:57,190
popular last year so where did social

174
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,539
engineering come from what's the origins

175
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:03,069
story it's hard to tell really but sales

176
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,860
and marketing have been doing this for

177
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,580
years very effectively so the ability to

178
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,830
change your mind to to buy something I

179
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,628
love to go to a used-car lot

180
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,628
I go to a used-car lot usually with a

181
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:18,250
really big cup of coffee and I'm not

182
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,719
usually intending to buy a car but I

183
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,180
really like to go through the techniques

184
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:24,190
that they will use to convince me that

185
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,719
it's a good idea to buy the car and to

186
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,729
convince me to spend the most amount of

187
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:29,560
money to do that so it's it's really

188
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,380
interesting to see that one of the other

189
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,330
great examples of this usually in the

190
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,490
cities like in Paris you'll see this in

191
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,229
London and Berlin I saw this a lot if

192
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,430
you go to see the street performers

193
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,008
especially the ones that are doing

194
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,529
three-card Monte but the tricking of

195
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,789
itself is not that sophisticated you can

196
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,460
google it and figure out how they do it

197
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,990
but the way they entice people in by

198
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,719
kind of showing them the cards really

199
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,759
quickly to get them to think that they

200
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,639
can cheat the system it's it's

201
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,370
fascinating to watch a really good group

202
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,440
of people that are doing that so what's

203
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,080
the trend with social engineering these

204
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,879
these numbers are great I mean if you're

205
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,979
doing a fishing program you will be

206
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,779
effective really it's big it's strictly

207
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,580
about the numbers so somebody's gonna

208
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,430
click the link and that's gonna work out

209
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,650
for you if you're doing a fishing

210
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,270
program you need to be sensitive to your

211
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,500
employees because they will eventually

212
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,240
click you will get success rates so this

213
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,190
is really the trend is going up if you

214
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,940
were to bet on this it's it's a very

215
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,940
safe bet

216
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,209
however when we look at the different

217
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,970
models in our training we look at things

218
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,070
like if you have your cissp there was

219
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:42,100
not a lot of social engineering content

220
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,630
there was there the iso model or if you

221
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,430
look at that it only goes up to

222
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,080
application it doesn't have anything

223
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,270
about user so you know this is a bit of

224
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,330
a joke here with this table we've added

225
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,069
the user component there because really

226
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,480
we can talk about firewalls we can talk

227
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,280
about perimeter we can talk about all

228
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,840
these things but if I call your

229
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,319
employees and ask for their password

230
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,210
they're gonna give it to me so I really

231
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,340
think we need to integrate more of the

232
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,070
social engineering component into what

233
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,810
we do okay

234
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,290
so kevin Mitnick of course he said it

235
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:19,079
well years ago he's one of the experts

236
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:21,160
in this area are you all convinced how

237
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,800
how big and concerning social

238
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,459
engineering is anybody not convinced yet

239
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,459
I need one person otherwise I can't do

240
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,870
the demo okay thank you sir perfect

241
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,030
thank you very much but it was good that

242
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,070
most of you are convinced already great

243
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,930
so I'm gonna do a quick demo it's

244
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,450
ridiculous because I have like you know

245
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,579
30 seconds to do it okay and the other

246
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,640
part about this is why I hate doing it

247
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,100
is because if I trick you you hate me if

248
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,630
I don't trick you I'm a fraud so I lose

249
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,290
either way but it's kind of fun to do so

250
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,540
we'll do it okay so it's as quickly as I

251
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,670
can and an example of how social

252
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,219
engineering might work and the rhythm of

253
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,319
it so it's all about technique and speed

254
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,420
and rhythm so let's say we're all a

255
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,850
company here okay we just started this

256
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,040
company it's an awesome company I'm the

257
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,680
one security guy for the all of you and

258
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,410
I'm gonna write this policy that says

259
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,540
like typical policies say write don't do

260
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,589
something and none of you will read it

261
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,110
of course but I'll write it and I'll

262
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,090
feel good about that so let's I need

263
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,370
something that's visual so I can see if

264
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,530
you're violating the policy so let's use

265
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,790
like hand flipping because I can see

266
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,050
that okay and I'm not gonna make you

267
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,140
dance or anything I'll just hand

268
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,339
flipping that sound fair

269
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,930
okay good so the policy says no hand

270
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,550
flipping okay so anything after this

271
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,519
point throughout the whole day

272
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,229
don't flip your hands okay okay good so

273
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,930
just put your hands out in front of you

274
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,600
like a zombie and so I can see your

275
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:52,079
hands yeah okay good okay we're gonna

276
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,680
start with our hands up okay so that's

277
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,359
it so I I got a few of you I know it's

278
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,589
ridiculous right but but just because I

279
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,190
got you to do this and then I got you to

280
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,829
do that so I'm sorry

281
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,060
so it's ridiculously short but I don't

282
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,420
have a lot of time if you want to do

283
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,029
more complicated google the shell game

284
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,329
or three-card Monte or something like

285
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:16,920
that those are even better so if you

286
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,510
want to do social engineering in your

287
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,029
company and you want to do maybe a

288
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,860
bitching program or fishing or or get

289
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,089
some awareness going there's you just

290
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,120
google it you'll find tons of

291
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,860
information about how effective it is

292
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,230
one of my favorites is a 50 million

293
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,310
dollar bank transfer that's a bad day

294
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,860
alright so I'm going to go through the

295
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,239
sec TF really quick brief overview of

296
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,420
what that looks like because this is

297
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,449
such a good example of how effective it

298
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,819
is basically these are new people that

299
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:49,229
come into this they're not necessarily

300
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,730
super familiar with it so they're

301
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,920
they're getting up to speed very quickly

302
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,449
they're targeting real companies and so

303
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,459
if you know what I'm doing with trace

304
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:58,589
labs you know that I'm a big fan of the

305
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,619
non theoretical and that's what this is

306
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,839
that's why I love it so stage one is you

307
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,810
do your Osen if you get accepted 16

308
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,640
competitors compete in this at vegas you

309
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,859
start off at home in your pajamas if you

310
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,990
want you do I did about 6,000 minutes

311
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,579
which is a huge amount of time the first

312
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,769
year I did it I just collected

313
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,120
everything on the company executive cell

314
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,209
phone numbers the names of their pets

315
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,949
everything you've got 29 flags you're

316
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:25,529
not allowed to engage so it's passive

317
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,240
recon and then you you get points for

318
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,890
that and then you go to Vegas and you do

319
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,839
your fishing so you're phoning the

320
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,990
company the actual company you've got 20

321
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,760
minutes to get the same flags so it's

322
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,300
really interesting to watch even to

323
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,730
watch it's fascinating the flags fairly

324
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,079
benign right so if you I can't really

325
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,580
read that you probably can't either but

326
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,370
they're things like

327
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,080
what's your service pack level how long

328
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,620
have you worked for the company when do

329
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:55,110
you get paid you know you went to your

330
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,610
OS that's sort of stuff so it's not good

331
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,480
you don't want to freely give that out

332
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,190
but it's not terrible stuff these are

333
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,899
better so this is what would be what I

334
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,940
would ask your company right in real

335
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,240
life so I want to know about your

336
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,890
environment what are your assets

337
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,040
what kind of what's your patch level so

338
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,300
if I want to attack I need to know that

339
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,390
you know what are some of the ways I can

340
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,490
deploy exploits so is it going to be

341
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,050
email web just drop in USB keys in your

342
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,720
elevator what's that look like

343
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,279
what's your antivirus perimeters and

344
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,870
like what kind of firewalls are using

345
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,540
all this sort of stuff would be much

346
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,070
more interesting to me some of the other

347
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,829
areas I really like to focus on is your

348
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,970
backups so attackers we're gonna be

349
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,890
motivated for a few different reasons

350
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,110
maybe it's malicious so they want to

351
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,540
delete data so you can't restore so your

352
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,760
RTO RPO is important your DRP plan do

353
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,920
you have a DRP plan right so that would

354
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,620
be interesting I haven't seen many

355
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,209
stories yet where attackers remove your

356
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,920
DRP plans so that you don't have

357
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:55,140
processes to follow but that would be

358
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,069
interesting how do you respond to an

359
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,110
attack that would be good Intel the know

360
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,500
so I'm going to get into the O's inside

361
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,329
of it a little bit now so as you're

362
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,040
starting your own operations and we do

363
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,989
this a lot now with trace labs so we're

364
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,969
doing this every week this is more

365
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,339
focused on people than than companies

366
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,839
but this will be more company focused so

367
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,089
the first thing I will do is I'll take a

368
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,459
look at - what what's the what's the

369
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,770
entity that I'm about to look at what's

370
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,109
the dynamics of that right so is are

371
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,449
they multinational company are they

372
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,060
single building what does that building

373
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:33,300
look like so starting to zoom in on the

374
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,010
locations you know Street View of course

375
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,069
and looking through that getting into

376
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:40,050
the technical their websites their IPs

377
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,290
all their technical information getting

378
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,089
into the corporate so they're legal

379
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,709
documents online property management is

380
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,480
an excellent resource to look like

381
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,910
anything that they've registered of

382
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,010
course and then you get into the the big

383
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,899
area which of course is staff and that's

384
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,319
where you can spend a large amount of

385
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,170
time

386
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,810
so my go-to favorite of course is

387
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:05,050
LinkedIn so I love it so much because

388
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,430
it's so well organized for OSINT you

389
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,279
know you can it's got some limitations

390
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,099
it tries to make you pay for the service

391
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,360
if you use this LinkedIn x-ray it's an

392
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,860
excellent tool and there's a few other

393
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,750
tools you can use as well that was the

394
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,430
one I used quite a bit you can get

395
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,560
around some of the limitations of the

396
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,790
free version but the reason I like it is

397
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,739
because you get a structure of the

398
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,839
organization very quickly you get to

399
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,329
find out who the key players are very

400
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,980
quickly the pictures but then also in

401
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,388
the top right corner it will sometimes

402
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,339
give you the rest of their social media

403
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,889
so you actually don't have to go hunting

404
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,930
for that it's just right there so this

405
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,730
is a one of the most effective places to

406
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,089
start especially for large data

407
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:45,850
collection and then of course you will

408
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,259
get a ton of information if you know

409
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,720
you're looking at a large company of

410
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,610
several thousand people that's a huge

411
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,889
amount of information so what you want

412
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,420
to do is find the key players social

413
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:57,880
butterflies those people that are

414
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:05,649
posting large amount of inappropriate

415
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:09,220
data so when I first did this I was

416
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:11,230
terrible and so of course I was detected

417
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,329
by people I would look at go onto

418
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,610
LinkedIn and look at the company with my

419
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:18,430
own account and of course they would

420
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,529
then all look at mine so not a good idea

421
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,180
so I learned very quickly that that's

422
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,790
not a good idea to do so you want to set

423
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,709
up your environment and typically when

424
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,969
we do Osten operations what I find is

425
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,750
especially people that are new to it

426
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,490
they want to jump right in very quickly

427
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,529
that initial setup is really important

428
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,560
making sure your platform set up making

429
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,389
sure you're you're prepared to find the

430
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,310
information and then do something with

431
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,139
it right so if you're going to go to

432
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,630
court with it if you're gonna you know

433
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,370
need to organize it and produce a report

434
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,889
you need to be organized as you get set

435
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,500
up so just take the time to make sure

436
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,029
you're not detected but then also that

437
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,279
you've got your preparations set up

438
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,949
right so how are you preserving your

439
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,870
information how is it going to be you

440
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:03,160
know contained and then report it out

441
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,669
how are you going to convey what those

442
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,020
important data points are that you find

443
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:08,740
we work with Huntley a lot it's a great

444
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,210
product

445
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,450
he's also Canadian

446
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,829
so am i you know so it's stuff that's

447
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,060
all I can't stress that enough most

448
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:20,199
people want to jump jump right into it

449
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:24,040
alright let's get into fishing a little

450
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,810
bit so now you've done your OSINT

451
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,569
on your target you've got some great

452
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,669
information you're ready to go and you

453
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:33,820
need to kind of boil it down to okay who

454
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,830
are gonna be my my marks and in the sec

455
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,139
TF in Vegas you only have twenty minutes

456
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,340
so of course you want to select people

457
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,710
that you know are going to be successful

458
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,120
same in the real world right you can't

459
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,390
phone everybody in the company what you

460
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,610
could but you know if if you're masked

461
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,920
doing this but if you're a targeted test

462
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,540
team you probably wouldn't so this is

463
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,750
the formula that I use that was very

464
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,730
effective I'm looking for a low Linkedin

465
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,890
score and the reason for that is I don't

466
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,330
want somebody that's a real veteran in

467
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,270
the industry I want somebody that's

468
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,210
relatively new and just doesn't know how

469
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,000
things work too well yet I'm looking

470
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,780
also for somebody who likes

471
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,030
self-promotion so if they're doing a lot

472
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,290
of selfies I know that they're sharing a

473
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,520
lot of information I know that they're

474
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,600
probably going to talk to me when I get

475
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,310
them on the phone so that's really good

476
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,740
and I also want poor judgment so I want

477
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,250
someone who over shares so I want that

478
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,260
person who's posted the VPN information

479
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,740
on their Twitter or whatever so I'm

480
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,000
looking for high charisma low wisdom and

481
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,670
typically what that turns out to be is

482
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,380
interns and contractors and and the

483
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,760
reason for that is I think interns you

484
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,060
know they're fairly new to the company

485
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,520
they don't know contractors not as

486
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:49,600
invested in the company so again it's

487
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,450
those are my go-to targets all right

488
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,520
some techniques that I used in Vegas and

489
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,680
and these you'll find a lot of them are

490
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,470
used by sales as well so when you get a

491
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,420
sales call they use some of these so the

492
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,910
confirmation how do you like the Dell

493
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,160
laptops and I know you already have Dell

494
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,570
laptops got I've done my OSINT now I can

495
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,890
start a conversation with you and

496
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,780
because you're gonna give me your

497
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,550
opinion which is great now I have dialog

498
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,129
and that's what I want the reverse

499
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:18,040
confirmation I have to drop my ego to do

500
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,810
this and let you correct me and a lot of

501
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,520
people like to do that so if you know

502
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,350
the personality of your target and you

503
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,680
know they're that way this could be a

504
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,620
rule

505
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,570
good technique name-dropping so I will

506
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,610
usually use this one in a compliment so

507
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,270
I'll say hey you were suggested to talk

508
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,860
to us from so-and-so it makes you feel

509
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,460
really good but it also gives you this

510
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,439
title of authority blowing smoke so

511
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,850
again you know you were recommended to

512
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,530
work with us so I'm trying to make you

513
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,530
feel really good with that one uh

514
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,600
impending doom I've used this one in

515
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,870
Vegas it was really effective I really

516
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,149
like it there's a event that's going to

517
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,639
happen something's coming your way you

518
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,560
can't stop it but I can help you get

519
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,000
through that so an example of that would

520
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,179
be hey we're gonna be on site tomorrow

521
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,680
to do maintenance on your HVAC and I

522
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,330
just want to know you know are you

523
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,390
prepared for that can I help you in any

524
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,399
way um they'll be surprised but you're

525
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,950
there to support them allowed to vent if

526
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,720
you can get people to complain I find

527
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,980
that's very nice quite often if

528
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,300
everybody's professional people don't

529
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,450
want to complain to strangers but if you

530
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,710
can that can be very productive

531
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,500
smartypants so just giving people

532
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,640
compliments in everyday life so this is

533
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,460
what I was talking about with social

534
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,660
engineering being kind of a gray area

535
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,490
whenever you give people compliments

536
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,760
they feel good right is that a bad thing

537
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:42,040
I don't think so right I think it's it's

538
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,240
it's quite nice actually but if you're

539
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,950
doing social engineering it's a great

540
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,650
place to start so by just giving

541
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,380
somebody a compliment and started as a

542
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,810
starting point to the dialogue zero-sum

543
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,600
game so this is used a lot by real

544
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,909
attackers and sales people the first

545
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,820
three people will win this right so

546
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:04,080
let's say it's a time sensitive thing

547
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,100
sympathy this is a great one as well so

548
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,560
because everybody wants to help

549
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,020
everybody else oh I'm new at this can

550
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,460
you please help me you know done right

551
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:18,090
that is so hard to resist right very few

552
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,670
of us don't want to help people

553
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:24,070
so with any of your pretexts these are

554
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:27,120
some of my go-to ones these are entry

555
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,740
methods so how do you get into a company

556
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,439
you know on the phone so then I can move

557
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,610
around within the company because it's

558
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,470
tricky sometimes you're going to hit

559
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,929
reception if you don't have a direct

560
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,700
inward dial phone number for

561
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,530
a certain target you're gonna hit

562
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,000
reception how do I get through reception

563
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:46,770
so intern program so I don't know if

564
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,090
it's called interns here in the US it's

565
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,210
called interns in Canada it's called

566
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:53,250
coops so I'm calling from the school to

567
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,350
find out how my intern or co-op is doing

568
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,750
sounds very legitimate I did a lot of

569
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,580
research with receptionist's and I would

570
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,750
talk about these different pretext and

571
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,699
they would tell me oh yeah that might

572
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,730
work and that one definitely won't work

573
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,620
this was one of the winners anything to

574
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,630
do with industry knowledge so we all

575
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,580
have different areas of knowledge mine

576
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,530
is more data center focused so I can

577
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:17,550
talk a lot about data centers and HVAC

578
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,350
so that's always my go-to story so I

579
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,530
talked about HVAC maintenance I need to

580
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:25,169
talk to your facilities people so that's

581
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,780
one of my favorites targeted methods and

582
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,490
so this was a technique that Mitnick

583
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,070
would use a lot so he was very layered

584
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,990
approach and he would just stack those

585
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,379
layers up so that time he got to the

586
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,900
final call he had so much information so

587
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,500
these work very very well and they can

588
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,390
be very scripted so the FedEx one we all

589
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,950
have got the FedEx call some of it might

590
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,260
be on your voicemail so you can listen

591
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,630
to it over and over again so you can

592
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,510
really dial that in and get it perfect

593
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,890
and sound exactly like FedEx and to get

594
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,410
a little bit of information from them

595
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,430
the potential tenant so maybe you're

596
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,050
phoning them and you're going to move

597
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,580
into their building you're saying you

598
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,590
want to find out a little bit about the

599
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,280
property management and that works

600
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,409
really well as well one of my favorites

601
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,270
is can I tell you a secret the the

602
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,680
recruitment layoffs so I'm calling from

603
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,960
a company we're gonna lay off some

604
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,850
people I want to talk to your HR because

605
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,460
these people might want to apply for

606
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,679
jobs in your company the HR people are

607
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,650
often motivated by that because they may

608
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,200
get a bonus for bringing people in so

609
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,970
they're financially motivated to talk to

610
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,130
me to give me information about their

611
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,900
company so if you can find out the

612
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,700
linkage like that where people are going

613
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,500
to get money for telling you their

614
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:43,230
secrets that works really well

615
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,850
full dumps so in Vegas you're motivated

616
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,400
as a contestant to get as much

617
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,740
information as fast as possible because

618
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,870
you only have 20 minutes in the booth so

619
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,190
this was

620
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,520
these were full dumps it's just trying

621
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,020
to get one person to tell me everything

622
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,000
you know you're the lucky winner a radio

623
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,520
contest just answer these questions

624
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,130
about your company and you win a prize

625
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,740
not that effective really because this

626
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,390
is kind of an old gimmicky technique but

627
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,460
if you want to get a lot of information

628
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,500
in a hurry sometimes it could work one

629
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,660
of one of the better ones I've found was

630
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,180
the OP great opportunity so I'm your new

631
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,830
dell account rep when you when your

632
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,200
account rep changes they don't usually

633
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,000
notify you sometimes they do now it's

634
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,740
getting more common but I could just

635
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,750
call you cold call you and say hey I'm

636
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,610
your new account rep and I want to ship

637
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,460
you some new products so you can try it

638
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:35,040
out something that's gonna be you know

639
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,680
sound good to you and be enjoyable so I

640
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,200
can then get a dialogue going

641
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:44,310
employment engagement survey one of the

642
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,810
best ones I did so and I'll mix a couple

643
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,770
techniques in with this so I'll say hey

644
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:51,090
the VP of HR told me to call you she

645
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,800
said that you would be an excellent

646
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,990
person to talk to about this we're doing

647
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,149
an employee engagement survey and I want

648
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,410
to design it to be very effective so I

649
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,570
can increase help increase the

650
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,980
engagement in your company you do have a

651
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,270
few minutes to talk to me about that and

652
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,020
then I just ripped through all the

653
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,650
questions and this one works really well

654
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,910
ok you caught me

655
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,460
so a lot of people say in social

656
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,260
engineering if you get caught you should

657
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,630
just stick to your pretext and just keep

658
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,860
with the same story I don't really think

659
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,710
that's as effective as saying okay you

660
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,080
caught me great job I was actually hired

661
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,340
by your company to do this and you're

662
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,470
the first person that's that's

663
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,179
questioned me congratulations I'm going

664
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,590
to tell your boss and that's fantastic

665
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,960
now can I go through all these questions

666
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,570
with you just to do a baseline so you're

667
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,370
gonna get the answers any way that way

668
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:41,580
so I haven't tried that I've just been

669
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:44,429
dying to try that alright so now we've

670
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:49,020
done some attacks let's get into some

671
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:53,280
defense techniques first a reflective

672
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,870
moment so you know would you know if you

673
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,720
are attacked by social engineering would

674
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,879
your executives tell you that oh yeah we

675
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,760
just did a wire transfer of 50 million

676
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,410
dollars you don't have to answer that

677
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,360
out loud but I'm betting

678
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,430
a lot of us wouldn't right away

679
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,649
especially and then would we know how to

680
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:14,070
respond to that right so who do you call

681
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,350
if if you weren't really you know there

682
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,439
was no breach necessarily but your

683
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,639
executive just did a money transfer

684
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,440
right so who gets involved they're

685
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,290
probably the legal department

686
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:28,860
maybe fraud the police of course your

687
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:31,680
banking your finance team right so all

688
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:35,490
these people but whose fault is it right

689
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,230
who's getting fired so my bet is they're

690
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,600
gonna come to information security and

691
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,560
say why didn't you educate us right

692
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,570
that's my bet so something to think

693
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,090
about we don't often spend a lot of

694
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,100
money in our total information security

695
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,570
budget to look at these areas but I

696
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,290
think we need to start focusing on that

697
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,790
more so some some quick recommendations

698
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,500
that you can do so of course

699
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,860
oh cinch yourself that's always fun Oh

700
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,850
since your partner oesn't your friends

701
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,620
friends of mine when they're renting

702
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,760
their accommodations they will send me

703
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,169
there sometimes the people that are

704
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,940
gonna rent it I'll do some quick OSINT

705
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,280
on them and tell them what that looks

706
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,260
like Oh at your company that's also very

707
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,399
interesting find those butterflies find

708
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,560
the people that are just giving away

709
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,730
everything then you can go down and sit

710
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,460
down with them and talk to them about

711
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,620
that right do you we can't stop people

712
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,270
from self promoting people are going to

713
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,469
continually self promote what they're

714
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,150
doing and they should they should be

715
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,070
proud of what they're doing but they

716
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,570
need to have good judgment so don't put

717
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,580
the VPN information on the Internet

718
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,520
right so but we need to educate them

719
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,230
about that show them what's at risk

720
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,450
building up our defenses so fishing

721
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,790
programs are excellent to do they need

722
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,320
to be done correctly you don't want to

723
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,909
insult your employees you don't want to

724
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,770
alienate your employees you want to

725
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,480
reward them right so you want to find

726
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,980
out how many people click on it but then

727
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,470
also how many people are reporting that

728
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,540
to you afterwards so we did a phishing

729
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,860
program a while ago it definitely

730
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,930
increased the amount of people that come

731
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,939
into IT and into information security

732
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,580
and say hey should I click on this or

733
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,670
not like it looks a little bit weird so

734
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,590
that's what you want right some things

735
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,290
you can do is removing the EA putting an

736
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,240
ext tag on incoming email so you can

737
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,990
always see if that's really from the

738
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,990
President or not

739
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:20,010
stop allowing active links nobody's

740
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,510
gonna do that but that is a an option I

741
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,570
only met one company that did that and

742
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,950
I'm sure that it's not very convenient

743
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,260
provide safer communication channels

744
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,700
right so email is is really painful if

745
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,390
you get as many email as I do and I'm

746
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,309
sure you do

747
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,840
you just can't read them all and so

748
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,370
you're going through them as fast as you

749
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,230
can to process it's like maybe one

750
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,739
second on each email and if it looks

751
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,140
legit

752
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,429
you're clicking the link right so you

753
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,150
know there's a lot of other technologies

754
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:46,919
out there that we can start to get into

755
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,780
this your executive those are really the

756
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,820
high-value targets so if they're

757
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,740
educated and prepared for you know

758
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,990
what's about to descend upon them that's

759
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,030
probably better they can avoid the

760
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,530
embarrassment later but of course get

761
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,350
their permission talk to them about it

762
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,080
make sure they buy into it create choke

763
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,918
points your receptionist in your company

764
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,350
is kind of a really a bastion of that

765
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,450
the physical entry right so but how much

766
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,480
money do we invest in our inner inner

767
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,100
receptionist to to do that how much

768
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,919
information security training do we give

769
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,740
those people so I've spoke to dozens of

770
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,270
them around what they do and how they do

771
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,740
it and it's amazing but most of it is

772
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,830
self-taught so there's a great

773
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,870
opportunity there on your PBX I love

774
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,520
your PB X's because I can call in to

775
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,370
them at night and I get so much

776
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,020
information you know you can remove dial

777
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,090
by name because that's the first thing I

778
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,668
go to and most of them are all the same

779
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,110
vendor so they the you know moving

780
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:45,000
around and it is actually pretty pretty

781
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,549
similar but I'll get your your name your

782
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,080
extension your D ID if you've got one if

783
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:50,280
you're on holiday I usually get your

784
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,299
voicemail I can find out where you went

785
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,428
on holiday

786
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:57,510
who else is responsible while you're

787
00:29:53,429 --> 00:30:01,260
away your cell phone number just tons of

788
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,669
stuff so you know and also D IDs I don't

789
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,760
think your whole company needs direct

790
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:07,679
inward dial you know I would use

791
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,510
extensions for some of your non sales he

792
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,520
type people and then of course stop

793
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,320
answering the phone so I I did this talk

794
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,460
internally and there's a lot of managers

795
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,530
in the room and they all gave me the

796
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,000
stink-eye so of course if your boss

797
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,799
calls you want to pick up the phone but

798
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,120
otherwise like I never pick up my phone

799
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,639
anymore it goes straight to voicemail

800
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,590
I hear the voicemail unless I recognized

801
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,310
the name and then I can decide whether

802
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,990
to call him back or not

803
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:32,909
get on the end offensive right so

804
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,100
there's a whole bunch of things we could

805
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,170
do that most companies don't do right we

806
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,969
we have the annual training that's

807
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:41,790
available but it's not very effective

808
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,860
right so instead I would encourage you

809
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:46,950
to create goals for your employees right

810
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,169
start giving out prizes coffee cards and

811
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,450
things like that and do it every month

812
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,490
right don't wait a whole year to do your

813
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,020
training right because you know people

814
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,330
are gonna forget that the day after they

815
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,310
do it if they even do it so instead I

816
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,350
would celebrate when people actually are

817
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,480
effective and they they do something

818
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,760
like so if somebody comes to you and

819
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,370
they have an email and they didn't click

820
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,690
the link give them a coffee card or you

821
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,290
know and celebrate that put it on your

822
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,000
SharePoint site or your intranet and

823
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,040
then the cultural change right so we

824
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,540
always say in information security oh we

825
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,060
you know the bad guys only have to get

826
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:24,720
lucky once and so we had that scale

827
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,790
challenge right and so the way that to

828
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,430
win against that is to create this this

829
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:31,110
culture of protectionism right so if I

830
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,630
want to draft through and tailgate

831
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,520
through the front door it's awkward to

832
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,720
stop me right you kind of feel like oh

833
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,030
you don't you don't want to say no you

834
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,190
don't to close the door on my face but

835
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,740
if you develop that culture of well I

836
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,480
need to see your ID card and if I don't

837
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,420
see one I'm gonna help you and bring you

838
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,190
to the reception right so it's hard to

839
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,380
change the culture to get there but I

840
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:55,410
think by doing this sort of education

841
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,170
with your employees and in celebrating

842
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,900
when they are doing things well you can

843
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,030
get there alright so everybody always

844
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,680
asked me for tools and resources so I'm

845
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,629
going to show you these but know that

846
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,310
these change every day these were some

847
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,320
of my go-to favorites but every day

848
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,990
there's new OSINT tools out there that I

849
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,760
like so really this is just a snapshot

850
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,590
in time I encourage you to go out there

851
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,000
and look at the different tools and then

852
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,610
also the techniques which I think are

853
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,610
even more important oops

854
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,800
so the physical I always start there

855
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,020
these are ridiculously easy but youtube

856
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,879
if you can find a tour of the office and

857
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,830
just slow it down slide by slide you'll

858
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,410
get everything you'll get CCTV you'll

859
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,679
get the card scan on the door you'll get

860
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,090
you know different access points Google

861
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,830
Maps of course Street View what I like

862
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,300
to do is look at a loading dock

863
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,189
I like to look at the roof to see what's

864
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,169
on the roof different points of entry

865
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,930
there's so much you can get from that I

866
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,550
also like to do where you can go back in

867
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,470
time with Google Maps to see what's

868
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,110
changed right now they change parking

869
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,120
providers all that sort of stuff is

870
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,379
really nice and different also different

871
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,989
points in the day so what's it look like

872
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,760
at night as opposed to the daytime IOT

873
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,900
of course now there's tons of stuff

874
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,730
there as well but on the technical side

875
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,980
of things of course these are you know

876
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,090
some of the go-to ones hurricane

877
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,610
electric is great

878
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,129
Wiegel is one of my favorites so you can

879
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,219
get the SSID typically from that without

880
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:24,840
actually doing any technical work at all

881
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:27,690
so that's a great go-to tool on the

882
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,730
corporate side so these again are basic

883
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,130
but they give you so much information so

884
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,240
indeed you're gonna give me your job

885
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,770
descriptions and in your job

886
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,900
descriptions you're gonna show me all of

887
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,860
your technology that you use right

888
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,750
you're gonna say oh we need somebody

889
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,729
that knows how to use you know

890
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,410
checkpoint firewall or Palo Alto or

891
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,140
something like that right so okay now I

892
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,670
know it use paste bin you can set up

893
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,720
alerts for the company and paste bin

894
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:52,200
which is really nice

895
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,820
Glassdoor same sort of thing employees

896
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,290
will complain about the company and tell

897
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,030
tell me you know what's going on there

898
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:01,680
as far as different things I can use

899
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:04,290
yeah I like to focus on you can focus on

900
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,730
security guards card access there's

901
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,710
there's tons of stuff you can get from

902
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,540
there and then of course staff so

903
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,750
LinkedIn I mentioned that that's my go

904
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,310
to Instagram of I think it's probably my

905
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,770
close second just because there's so

906
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,779
much good information there SlideShare

907
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,340
is nice for reference letters reference

908
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,960
letters are important because they will

909
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,360
give you typically they're written by

910
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,949
executives and typically they will give

911
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,140
you things like their home phone number

912
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:30,029
or their cell phone number which is

913
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,879
really nice to have for to further your

914
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,040
Osen on that particular target I'm not

915
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,020
sure if they do that here but in Canada

916
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,330
criminal records are also publicly

917
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,409
available and so I will always look at

918
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,090
that to see if you have a criminal

919
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,339
record because not only does it give me

920
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,590
more insights into who you are but it

921
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,050
also gives me your aliases so several

922
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,940
criminals that we've found that we look

923
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,160
at they all have a ton of aliases and

924
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,540
then their social media will be built on

925
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,190
those aliases

926
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,720
so that's really interesting to take a

927
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,820
look at depending on what kind of your

928
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,620
target is and then of course personal

929
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,760
websites lots of people will self

930
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,049
promote and they'll point to their

931
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,390
personal website which will have their

932
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:10,710
resume which again will be just super

933
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,000
rich in information so really quick this

934
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,740
is kind of a cheat sheet that you can

935
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,450
use that I would suggest that will help

936
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,459
you protect your company against people

937
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,799
like me in people much worse than me

938
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,510
right there's a lot of stuff going on

939
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,360
here but you don't need to put your job

940
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,640
descriptions in your sorry your specific

941
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,810
technologies in your job descriptions

942
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,160
right you can remove that make it a

943
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,860
little more generic make it harder for

944
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,049
me right your your your posts on the

945
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,670
technical forums we're reading that

946
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,140
right so when you're complaining about

947
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,210
having a problem with your Palo Alto

948
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,799
firewall people are reading that right

949
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,540
when you're saying at what level you're

950
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,030
at for your patch level we're reading

951
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,750
all that do some training with your

952
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,610
fishing right Auto log off of course

953
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,500
most of us are doing that as well as on

954
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,250
your VPN so have your VPN time out

955
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:58,020
that's a big one micro segmentation I'm

956
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:01,170
a really big fan of that of course as

957
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:04,110
well assume they're already in 2fa

958
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,250
everything privacy screens most of us

959
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,350
are doing that some of them are built

960
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,580
into the computers are already your

961
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,230
corporate stickers that are on your

962
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,000
laptops that say where your work those

963
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:15,300
are really nice you might want to get

964
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,030
rid of that removing the decision factor

965
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,830
by humans right so just removing the

966
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,600
ability for people to make a mistake is

967
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,580
really nice as well if you can do that

968
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,009
the choke points within your

969
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,299
organization so your receptionist if you

970
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,430
can get that person a little more

971
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,850
trained usually they're amazingly good

972
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,000
already

973
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:35,339
but I wouldn't best more there and CCTV

974
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,410
I haven't I can't count how many times

975
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,570
we look at people's CCTV and they find

976
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:42,299
out that it's actually not recording so

977
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,240
