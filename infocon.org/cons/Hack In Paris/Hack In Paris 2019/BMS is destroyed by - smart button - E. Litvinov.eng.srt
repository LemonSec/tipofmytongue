00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:13,200
[Applause]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,769
thank you for coming welcome for Hawking

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,259
parents

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,789
my name is the gore Latino friend I

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,820
would like told you how EMS may destroy

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,119
it by a smart button a few words about

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,359
me I work at a dress lab company

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,780
I searched different security issues in

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,760
our product before that I spent time to

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,710
program industrial control system

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,690
program pill see also look security

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:48,210
questions for industrial control system

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,870
and took part for smart home project so

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,870
in my presentation I told her what is it

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,038
bemis introduction sir Kennex

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,739
EJ award it means what the organization

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,290
connects suggest to protect foci

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,179
cybersecurity attack and what happened

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,240
in reality before my talk I would love I

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,060
would like to ask some questions

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,119
maybe somebody recent the news when

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,790
hiker locks the door in the hotel in

23
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,600
Austria and nobody can enter or exit

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,869
from the hotel and his room or as in use

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,658
was a hiker shut down heater system in

26
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,350
the building in the winter

27
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,229
so let's what is it be my as Bemis its

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,759
building management system it is very

29
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,640
huge season to realize a to realize

30
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
function for automation usually it is

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,890
possible divided for several level on

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,640
the bottom wealth is a sensor and

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:58,259
actuators for and usually it's usually

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,740
some smart button or some move detector

35
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,229
or climatic station or something else

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,899
next level is automation level this

37
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,470
level get information from sensors and

38
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,740
send common to exchangers for example

39
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,109
when you set up the heating system

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,010
when I can't perform at six o'clock I

41
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:23,670
will work to 25 degree for because it

42
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,649
needs comfortably and the top level of

43
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,859
building management system its

44
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,280
management well for example big boss who

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,550
look like well his employer come to the

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,120
work or how big boss will pay for

47
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,600
electricity because power strategic are

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,450
collected and like a mix cover bottom -

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,900
well and I will talk about this

50
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,530
technology and his weakness and inner

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,770
abilities so what is the main objective

52
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:59,070
of building manual systems first ladies

53
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,040
reduce power consumption comfort

54
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,590
operation of different systems and we

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,570
don't forget that it's comfort for us

56
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:12,500
for visitors and usually to build

57
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,180
beautiful management system use a lot of

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,960
different technology the main

59
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,860
technologies botnet as a technology

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:27,270
useful field level sometimes may be

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,910
exceptions because we can buy a lot of

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,070
different sensors actuators a program

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,210
logical controller for clinics for

64
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,269
example and realize all system use

65
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:43,410
single technology but sometimes it may

66
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:48,660
be very very expensive clinics we can

67
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,560
omit for some few buildings like ISO

68
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,230
square

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,580
I'll mark Town International Airport or

70
00:03:52,230 --> 00:04:00,989
wealth museum as I said for ant user

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,060
more clear understanding kids may be a

72
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,820
transplanted reader in your hotel when

73
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,840
we come after the conference or room

74
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,940
chair massage indoor presence the same

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,990
presence detection lot of other

76
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:19,019
different notes notes I mean sensors

77
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,840
actuators and something curls for

78
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,419
example ABB company provides interest in

79
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,049
solution for clinics hotel Hotel

80
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,620
automation

81
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,960
interesting because we can see that

82
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,690
transponder directly connect to clinics

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:41,159
network and this transponder may walk or

84
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:45,879
unlock the door for hotel room so now I

85
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:49,870
would like to talk more deeply about

86
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:52,539
clinics technology to reverse this

87
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,569
technology used the two main physical

88
00:04:52,539 --> 00:05:00,068
media I can express the pair or connects

89
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:00,669
the peep or clinics net IPM also you my

90
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,940
friend

91
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:07,568
clinics RF and can expire line but this

92
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:11,199
to technology not so popular the speed

93
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:14,110
limited presented on this slide common

94
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,340
questions when the owner will make

95
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,940
automation it's the quantity of lot

96
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,369
which may present it for connects

97
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,289
network or CB network or other network

98
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:34,300
so connects at rest up to 15 areas in

99
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:40,960
each area maybe up to 15 lines and in

100
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:43,960
each line up to 2255 notes it's mean one

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:49,979
smart button it's one not one act water

102
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:53,698
it's another node and up to 255 knots

103
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:57,180
now I will like say a few words about

104
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:02,020
house not communicate in clinics network

105
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:04,270
you can see that the logical 0 presented

106
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,690
by changing voltage on the wine and

107
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,599
logical one is no changing on the line

108
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,020
and this is a common structure of

109
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:18,009
connects frame which sent for from one

110
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,620
node to another node so the first byte

111
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,139
is control but it's described as a

112
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,500
priority of the frame and shows this

113
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:29,979
telegram repeat or not the next two byte

114
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:34,320
is source address and next byte is

115
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:36,839
receiver address and the structure of

116
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,820
receiving address it depends from the

117
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,120
integrated solution

118
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,940
and intelligent moment there are a lot

119
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,980
of documentation it's good but sometimes

120
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,940
this documentation conflict itself

121
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,230
because you can see for one sentence

122
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:59,200
says if you won't use group address use

123
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:02,080
defeat one and a few sentence later you

124
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:06,840
can see that for group address valve it

125
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:10,630
should be set to 0 the next 8-bit is

126
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,780
describes range of connects connects the

127
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,909
P frame roads encounter and how to

128
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,960
detect this message group or in general

129
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:24,760
address but I spent a few cup of coffee

130
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,870
because when I use canis connection at

131
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,090
IP and clinics GP frame and communicate

132
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,330
where I pick it way there are some

133
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,989
interest and moment about this moment I

134
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:42,310
will take a little bit later

135
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:46,000
finally there are TP shy and ATC I field

136
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,550
which describes common commands in

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,210
connects frame and how to the text is a

138
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:57,310
frame is this frame comment or is this

139
00:07:52,210 --> 00:08:01,450
call oh is this framed up datum and he

140
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,870
presented common a PCI comment and you

141
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,700
can see from and for me and for us I

142
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,880
hope it's very interesting that there

143
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:14,770
are some comment like read memory write

144
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:18,690
memory user message comment and as I

145
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:24,099
said usually also use connection at IP

146
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:28,300
to do that connects TP frame packet to

147
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:34,020
send message and sent via UDP Datagram

148
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:37,659
and he'll present at second control byte

149
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:41,829
this bite take me a lot of cup of coffee

150
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:45,270
coffee because in the documentation you

151
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,400
can see that this control by describe

152
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:51,750
the roach encounter and Blue Point you

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,529
doll address but when we use IP router

154
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,879
the second country

155
00:08:53,529 --> 00:09:06,129
but added and we should select and parts

156
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:10,889
this bite not first bite now I will talk

157
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:16,120
about few words how to in eg award by

158
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:18,850
clinics few years ago my recommendation

159
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,709
of clinics organization was rise our

160
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,449
communication and don't worry because

161
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:27,579
the war is hidden and nobody can hug

162
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:31,990
your building but it's not good

163
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:34,930
recommendation and now the white paper

164
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:38,069
for security position became better and

165
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:41,649
there are some mechanism through which

166
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:46,059
provide security communication also a

167
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:53,379
good user guides how to security can it

168
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:58,089
not use private key and make protect

169
00:09:53,379 --> 00:10:01,540
your systems and yet a software also

170
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:05,410
provides some security fusion like her

171
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,819
security IP communication however it's

172
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:14,949
ETL world and we live in reality and not

173
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:19,660
so good because when I try to add modern

174
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:22,750
IP Rooter to a test software I receive

175
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,180
this message that sorry you use IP

176
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,399
security communication but this device

177
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,729
don't support this future it's new

178
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,660
device which not support this device

179
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:37,059
which not support the security fusion

180
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:41,050
there are other pictures I hope you'll

181
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:43,870
recognize I hope you recognize this

182
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:48,008
print screen because it's shown on

183
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:50,559
senses and as a global search and we can

184
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:54,040
see that there are a lot of device which

185
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:57,249
connected to the to internet it's a lot

186
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:02,459
of different clinics device and we can

187
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:02,459
sometimes manipulate manage this device

188
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,300
so before look the attacks of face we

189
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:11,070
showed this

190
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,870
two questions first how to connect to

191
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:18,370
can exist where it is possible you

192
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:21,040
standalone device or dissing some

193
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:25,180
transceiver use smart like smart

194
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,199
transceiver or in my case I disagree on

195
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:31,870
serial based on analog elements the next

196
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,660
question is how to work with skin except

197
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,710
for how to configure so if you have

198
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,980
approximately $1,000 or less you can buy

199
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:45,910
a test software then you need press

200
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,180
button to switch in to program mode any

201
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:53,620
node and sometimes to do that you need

202
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:57,609
go to the attic of as a Boojum for press

203
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:02,800
button and after that you you can commit

204
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:07,380
configure lot and enjoy but I don't like

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,209
easy way and I try rights small tools

206
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,270
might rules allowed to connect to

207
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,980
connects network we are as a net usually

208
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:21,130
I pick a tree or also I use ESP 32

209
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,730
microcontrollers to connect via Ethernet

210
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:28,900
or Wi-Fi or connect directly to connects

211
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:32,140
twisted pair the mind future of this

212
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:38,560
tool is sniffing traffic scan not read

213
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:42,460
write and set key authorization well we

214
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,829
get answer for two common questions how

215
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:49,060
to connect and how to manage

216
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:51,220
so if attacker connect to clinics

217
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,510
twisted pair anywhere anywhere between

218
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:59,830
smart button in hotel room or climatic

219
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:04,000
station in outside secure perimeter he

220
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:07,240
can get basic information about lot he

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,020
can listen the traffic and also

222
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,750
understand what happens in the network

223
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:16,930
and no problem to realize the play

224
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,110
attack because just takes a telegram the

225
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:24,219
play and you have success so

226
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:28,660
we discovers the area or segment where

227
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:32,820
and intruders connected and after that

228
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:38,819
he can just manage any not because

229
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:42,820
protocol is simply and there are no any

230
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:46,770
security feature to send the Datagram

231
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:50,470
between the node and we hope that

232
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,660
integrators was good guys and make the

233
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,050
segmentation for for example for

234
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,910
different flow and the attacker finds

235
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:03,910
the IP route of each log it means that

236
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:08,280
this routers don't transfer the telegram

237
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:12,100
for as a network and we have

238
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:15,790
segmentation but we can use a common

239
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:19,180
treatment and we get all network

240
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:23,860
settings and look how the Schlueter lock

241
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,810
or unlock after that after that we use

242
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,610
comment right moment to change the

243
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,810
configuration we can change network

244
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:36,390
settings we can change his status and we

245
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:42,459
can unlock the rotor and discover other

246
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:45,460
signals after that we discover and may

247
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,760
manipulate change config and destroy

248
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,880
something or broke connections between

249
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:56,319
from example press button to switch

250
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:58,360
right and broke this connection models

251
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,710
are some nice fuchsia

252
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,530
during my research it is a DJ commands

253
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,900
user message as you remember the still

254
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:11,079
that says at the range of clinics the P

255
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,990
frame may up to 15 bars

256
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,000
however some routers allow transfer up

257
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,450
to 69 bytes

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,710
the next thing is that for some router

259
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:26,770
we need use pad part or patent because

260
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:30,010
when you send connects net IP frame to

261
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,550
clinics network and is this frame less

262
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:39,819
than 16 bytes the IP router don't

263
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:42,939
for this frame also you remember that I

264
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:45,750
see if you use a taste software you need

265
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:52,060
press button to change the configuration

266
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:56,200
in fact this action no need because just

267
00:15:52,060 --> 00:16:00,219
use comment read memory of right memory

268
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,769
and you have success and interest in

269
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,480
future key authorizations the connect

270
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:10,779
standards says that this key used for

271
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,570
memory access protection however you can

272
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:16,120
set new key they're not confirmed that

273
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:21,100
yes I receive new key it's okay

274
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:27,339
but after reboot no no lawful happens

275
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:30,399
you can use all the key now let's look

276
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:33,279
how the attacker made prepares a

277
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,269
springboard to penetrate the corporate

278
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,579
network or operation technology Network

279
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:42,459
as you remember he connects anywhere for

280
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:47,380
clinics TP line broke the segmentation

281
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:50,199
and finds the router which may abrasion

282
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,990
way from field site I mean from smart

283
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:58,240
button or other and devices after that

284
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:02,020
intruder my updation well for other

285
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,630
router so I hope you have a questions

286
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,750
how it is possible to update field well

287
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:11,110
from field side just use a PC I comment

288
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,270
usual message with additional comment to

289
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,479
read filter and right from where

290
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:20,349
additional code presented on the slide

291
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:23,290
and how to get control the other device

292
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:26,829
to do that there are some difficult

293
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,370
steps like connector Ethernet run the

294
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:33,428
under update tool and just this way and

295
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:38,559
no check present northen checks northen

296
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:41,080
integrity check just updated inside say

297
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,129
pewter you may find there are a lot of

298
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,080
different chemical controller units from

299
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:50,950
atmega 128

300
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,789
some different arm microcontrollers this

301
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:58,690
IP router work under Linux also custom

302
00:17:54,789 --> 00:18:03,039
server or not O's or some real-time OS

303
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:08,649
for embedded device and usually IP route

304
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:10,899
are you smart transceiver now I will

305
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:14,428
talk about a texture phase for

306
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:18,158
automation level for example the links

307
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:21,730
115 it is a program automation station

308
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,899
and this station will connect for a lot

309
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:32,070
of different protocols and technologies

310
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:36,359
which used to which use in VMs systems

311
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:39,639
on this right you can see that this

312
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:44,710
automation station a low manual control

313
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:47,799
micro SD card USB and Ethernet there are

314
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:50,590
free way to connect for this device set

315
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,918
of communication manual connect a manual

316
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:57,820
communication and as a net via HTTP FTP

317
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,820
Asajj and some other protocols so when

318
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,629
you connect in manual you can do

319
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,359
anything

320
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:07,988
operation we're done great silver change

321
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:10,779
stations to enable some future and to

322
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:14,230
this to do that you need also no

323
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:20,169
password know any other security

324
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:22,929
mechanism to changing but I think you

325
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:28,239
agree that more interest in remote

326
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:31,119
attack so the least 155 web interface

327
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:35,109
and when we open the browser and come to

328
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:40,080
this web interface we see the basic

329
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:44,949
information and for quest for quest user

330
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:48,549
we detect the number of film violations

331
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:52,859
what film where maybe downgrade also

332
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:55,960
which technology is used when we use

333
00:19:52,859 --> 00:20:01,629
default credentials he presented on the

334
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:05,559
slide there are a lot of information

335
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:08,260
you can draw also anything update silver

336
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:11,740
change settings or do something curls

337
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:15,850
and don't forget that all this

338
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:19,539
communication across HTTP or FTP

339
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:24,270
protocol it is not secure and you can

340
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:27,220
see that all web interface have a lot of

341
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,529
different attraction phase like SQL

342
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:34,000
injection cross-site scripting and

343
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:36,820
something else so you can see that the

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,710
range of password may be from one single

345
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,230
to fifteen singles I hope you agree that

346
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:50,440
fifteen singles it's more good password

347
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:54,340
but I look for formal rules and I don't

348
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,789
find that iptables my blog brute-force

349
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:01,389
there are no fail to bound search words

350
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:05,289
so if you miss you may prefer brute

351
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:10,419
force password and you also have success

352
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:16,120
of this realization little bit step

353
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:19,720
aside I spent a few minutes and finds

354
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,899
this inter sent note which use a default

355
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,149
credential password and it's not only

356
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:29,559
this device there are a lot of device

357
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:33,158
which use default password and only

358
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:35,980
small information message that when you

359
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,850
use the full password the web interface

360
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,710
face

361
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:46,629
hey you use default password and

362
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:49,960
continue so more interesting is a field

363
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,779
where for this automation server this

364
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,080
server you might download from official

365
00:21:52,779 --> 00:22:01,600
website it's at the first point of you

366
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:06,730
have magic extension like the dot DL but

367
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:09,610
inside this magic extensions there are a

368
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,990
lot of Debian package with some package

369
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:16,659
from high tech and

370
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:21,040
unfortunately there are a lot old old

371
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:27,070
package trees now ability for for this

372
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:30,970
device more oh I look for links a 1091

373
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:35,110
file it's one of general binary file and

374
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:38,650
we can see that this file not stupid and

375
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:41,080
there are a lot of information and stack

376
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:45,340
may be executed

377
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,679
also if you forget oh not forget if you

378
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:52,360
lose the documentation don't worry

379
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:55,450
because the silver can't contain

380
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,209
hard-coded credentials like admin and

381
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,540
only tech for use this default password

382
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,000
and you never lose this information

383
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:08,530
because it's hard-coded in the film

384
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,280
we're also interest and function call it

385
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:16,000
Phil we're update from file it's good

386
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:20,830
because this function a lotto operation

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,160
we're fix some bug but inside these

388
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,870
functions there are no any check just

389
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:31,660
check that there are additional spaced

390
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:36,179
update and update system well I think

391
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:39,520
you look the slide and get smile because

392
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:42,880
also in firmware was discovered some

393
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,010
private key and as I see the same

394
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,970
private key used for different versions

395
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:51,400
of film and for intellect ceiling I

396
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:57,190
suppose it's the same private key used

397
00:23:51,400 --> 00:24:00,880
for different devices also I look for

398
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:05,910
more modern automation station call it

399
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:09,370
links 153 but but but the situation is

400
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:14,170
yes of course some new specific package

401
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:17,550
for links 153 and a lot of old package

402
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:23,740
from the preview generation of this

403
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:25,960
automation station in conclusions for

404
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,129
additional information for

405
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,159
okay next security you can read and look

406
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:36,789
for this presentation from for example

407
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,100
for Jose Molina he describes that when

408
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:41,980
he reaches the luxury hotel he can

409
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,490
manage his lash in Nate ball truth

410
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,759
because connects network and public

411
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:53,559
Wi-Fi it's the same network the next

412
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:57,309
paper describers extended security for

413
00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:01,240
clinics but main idea of the security at

414
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:04,240
some additional field for security enter

415
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,779
the other presentation which describes

416
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,619
some security issue for ZigBee and

417
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:14,499
clinics as a conclusion unfortunately

418
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:17,259
connects network weakness and

419
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:20,740
vulnerability because it is possible

420
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:24,879
dos attack operation where from field

421
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:27,789
site manage any node and if we look for

422
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:32,320
automation station for from low-tech its

423
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:36,158
use old package and use non secure

424
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,519
communication protocols however not so

425
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:44,340
bad because the white paper

426
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:51,129
security become more body better by step

427
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:55,350
by step by step and now it's more better

428
00:25:51,129 --> 00:26:00,369
than few years ago and some vendors try

429
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:04,949
realize this security fuschia try spend

430
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:07,418
some time for security issue in clinics

431
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,840
finally I would like to say the great

432
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:14,679
rate for Dmitry Victor of Santa Monica

433
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,809
and my friends of keys thank you for

434
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,590
that for your attention and I am ready

435
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,590
for questions

436
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,929
you
