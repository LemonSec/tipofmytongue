1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,280
okay

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,419
so despite my yubikey doing what you

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,870
bikies do

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:18,240
welcome to social forensic ation this is

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,390
a multidisciplinary approach to

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,570
successful social engineering I am Joe

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,199
gray before we get started the thoughts

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,380
and opinions

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,429
I represent do not meet those of IBM I

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,650
just want you to know that twice by the

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,540
way I say that because I'm a senior

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,420
security architect there although I

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,680
typically don't admit it I am the 2017

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,380
derbycon social engineering

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,920
capture-the-flag winner my team got

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,640
third place at the NOLA con OSINT CTF in

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,490
2018 and 2019 as well as second place

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,680
this year at besides Atlanta I write for

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,380
Forbes from time to time and I do

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,820
training and I'm currently under

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:01,140
contract to write a book with no starch

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,450
press because my black badge is handmade

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,640
it took a year for them to make it it's

24
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,770
one-of-a-kind it has my name on it it

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,259
doesn't leave the house so this is the

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,590
closest that most people will ever see

27
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:15,329
of the derbycon black badge this is the

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,289
closing ceremony some of you may

29
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,419
recognize Christopher had Negi

30
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:23,909
presenting me with the winner's trophy

31
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,939
from that so to get into the meat and

32
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,189
potatoes of the actual talk basically

33
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,020
we're going to talk very briefly about

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,460
the basics of social engineering just

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,469
kind of to lay the groundwork to make

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,329
sure everyone's on pretty much the same

37
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,759
page and then we'll talk about existing

38
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,428
attacks maybe some familiar names or

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,439
faces and then we'll talk a little bit

40
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:46,579
about memory forensics and rogue Wi-Fi

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,589
things you can do with Wi-Fi and then

42
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:51,508
look at the considerations so your

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,179
decision-making process before you

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,329
decide to execute such an attack

45
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:59,579
how you actually execute it and then

46
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,829
because not everyone's on the red team

47
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,958
not everyone's a pen tester there's a

48
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,329
lot of blue team a little bit about the

49
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,940
mitigations and then time permitting

50
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,390
I've got recorded demonstrations of the

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,020
attacks as well so getting into social

52
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,109
engineering the basics of so

53
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,300
engineering at its most rudimentary

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,420
basis social engineering is human

55
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,480
hacking that's why Chris had naggy the

56
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,709
CEO of social engineering Inc is on

57
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,310
Twitter at human hacker

58
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,160
that's why his book his books are social

59
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,840
engineering the art of human hacking and

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,940
social engineering the science of human

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,530
hacking so there's a reason that's

62
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,810
behind that because basically you're

63
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,290
trying to influence people to do one of

64
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,440
two things in a broad stroke and that is

65
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,579
give you a piece of information or do

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,740
something give me your password I have a

67
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,940
badge in my backpack I'm willing to go

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,700
international with it I've actually got

69
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,050
a password inspector badge so if anyone

70
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,310
wants their passwords inspected just see

71
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,550
me in the hallway afterwards I'll make

72
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,220
sure it's up to code

73
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:11,410
or performing an action we typically

74
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,190
think of click a link execute a file if

75
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,530
you want to get a little bit more

76
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,510
creative though why not call the

77
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,690
firewall administrator and ask them to

78
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,570
open port 445 or 4444 to the public

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,970
internet I mean that could be probably

80
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,100
more catastrophic than anything you

81
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,200
could do with their password so when we

82
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,840
get into social engineering there are

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,540
various types and you've probably heard

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,180
numerous presentations about fishing and

85
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,890
fishing and while they're fun they're

86
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,320
really not the crux of this presentation

87
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,239
this presentation is taking into account

88
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,540
the physical aspect and I'm not really

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,090
going to talk so much about how to break

90
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,620
into a facility or any of that I'm gonna

91
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,160
talk more about building rapport and

92
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,240
getting someone to actually let you in

93
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,910
and then of course we have dumpster

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,920
diving and baiting as well another thing

95
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,540
that I always like to bring up I get a

96
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,339
lot of questions of I want to get into

97
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,769
social engineering how do I do this

98
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,870
there because there's really no roadmap

99
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,370
I mean if you want to become a sock

100
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,810
analyst there's a road map if you want

101
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,280
to become a pen tester there's a road

102
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,020
map there's a road map if you want to do

103
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,890
forensics there's not really one for

104
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:20,950
social engineering so these are the five

105
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,169
disciplines that humid of Lee make up

106
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,210
social engineering you've got your

107
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,280
improv you've got that because if you're

108
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,070
doing a fishing phone call or

109
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,619
in person you have to improv on the fly

110
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,780
you can have everything planned out but

111
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,790
something's going to go wrong you could

112
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,280
be making phone calls trying to get them

113
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,450
to go to an external website but the

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,429
problem that's going to come with that

115
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,950
is what happens when they don't have

116
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,630
external internet access you have to be

117
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,840
able to improvise and get around that

118
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,340
and the same goes for in-person I think

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,650
it was Mark Twain that said that the

120
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,750
hardest part about telling the lies is

121
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,270
keeping them all straight and that is

122
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,669
certainly applicable to social

123
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,320
engineering when you're doing in person

124
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,630
especially you need to you need to be

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,060
skilled with acting you need to be able

126
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,550
to get in that character and perform as

127
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,030
that character when I have my password

128
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,110
inspector badge on my name is Donnie but

129
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,799
it's just what it is until the badge

130
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,060
comes off well sometimes and then

131
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,700
because you're dealing with humans

132
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,260
you're trying to influence humans into

133
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,909
doing something you have to understand

134
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,289
the psychology of it and we'll discuss

135
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,930
that a little bit more on the next slide

136
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,430
of course the InfoSec piece because you

137
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,770
need to know what kind of defenses you

138
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,690
may be up against or something to that

139
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,099
effect and then of course technical

140
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,080
writing because as much as we all hate

141
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,020
it we all have to write reports it is

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,570
what it is just get used to it

143
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,810
so about the psychological concepts of

144
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:49,390
social engineering I believe it was in

145
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,340
2006 dr. Robert seal Dini came out with

146
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,180
a book called influence the psychology

147
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,460
of persuasion and he boils all aspects

148
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,430
of persuasion down to these six

149
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,799
principles those of you who were at the

150
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,710
DEFCON meeting earlier this week got my

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
car sales person pitch about how they

152
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,049
manipulate these six principles but I

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,450
won't go into them very deep here but

154
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,780
anyway reciprocity it's also known as

155
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:20,349
quid pro quo you do this for me I'll do

156
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:23,409
this for you for example one of my

157
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,700
favorite things to do when demonstrating

158
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,979
social engineering is go out into the

159
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,229
public and find people who are trying to

160
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,490
take like an awkward selfie and I'm like

161
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,010
hey would you like me to take that

162
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,470
picture for you I take the picture for

163
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,719
him after it's over oh hey could you

164
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,520
provide me with whatever arbitrary piece

165
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,810
of information that we've all agreed

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,389
upon

167
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,360
to collect whether it be mother's maiden

168
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,720
name or password or something like that

169
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,010
and typically because I just took a

170
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,639
picture for them then they didn't have

171
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:57,630
to have some awkward selfie I get it

172
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,419
commitment and consistency people don't

173
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:05,169
as humans we like patterns we like what

174
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:07,539
we are used to if we stick with that it

175
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,260
works very well we can influence things

176
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,460
by maintaining it as it is

177
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,460
conversely you can also elicit other

178
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,159
reactions by disrupting that consistency

179
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,549
but that's a completely different

180
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,970
creature

181
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:29,650
social proof successful people of said

182
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,240
gender at your age do things of this

183
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,780
nature

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,520
cool I'm not subscribing to it but car

185
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,289
sales people are the worst especially if

186
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,669
you're a male and you're early to

187
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,240
mid-30s they're gonna try to put you in

188
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,590
the most expensive two-seat car possible

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,450
likability show of hands in here who has

190
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:51,190
ever met a salesperson that didn't at

191
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:52,810
least attempt to be likable whether

192
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,390
they're likable or not it's not not the

193
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,350
question we know the answer to this it's

194
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,940
just attempt exactly Authority people

195
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,320
tend to do things when someone in a

196
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,590
position of authority whether it be

197
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,719
government or your boss wants you to do

198
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,250
it

199
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,030
my favorite pretext to use on the phone

200
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:18,039
is hi I'm calling under the authority of

201
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:22,388
insert executive C so CEO owner whatever

202
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,280
and I need this information I just named

203
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:28,419
drop them that's it

204
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,340
and then scarcity that one is supplies

205
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,409
are very limited you must act now you

206
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:36,900
have no time to stop and think about it

207
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:39,968
you must act if you want this now so

208
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:45,100
urgency so show of hands anybody know

209
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:47,380
this guy here okay he keeps a Pepsi in

210
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,860
business via his copious consumption of

211
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,850
Diet Pepsi it's Jason Street he's known

212
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,510
to gain access

213
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:02,230
excuse me to gain access and plug in

214
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,029
things specifically rubber duckies well

215
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,670
for the most part with what he's trying

216
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:09,550
to do to my knowledge he doesn't go

217
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,529
droppin malware but I know that some

218
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,459
operators on the offensive side of

219
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:18,010
security tend to drop malware when they

220
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,359
may use a rubber ducky but I've never

221
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,170
really heard anybody talking about

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,570
taking data out so when you think about

223
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,000
this from an adversarial perspective

224
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,240
when you are on a client site or you're

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,060
in a client environment whether it be

226
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,850
digitally or physically your biggest

227
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,939
concern is detection so what if I told

228
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,880
you you could collect this information

229
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:47,200
and walk right out the door so you don't

230
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,750
have to worry about the detection so

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,610
here's what you're going to need you're

232
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,730
going to need an external hard drive or

233
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,310
a thumb drive potentially and that's the

234
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,230
top left and the bottom right on the

235
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,660
bottom left and the top right we have to

236
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,750
hack five tools one of which being the

237
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,100
bash Bunny that's on the bottom left

238
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,380
which is very similar to the rubber

239
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,870
ducky which is on the top right as

240
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,959
you'll see the chip on the front of that

241
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,339
rubber ducky actually tells the computer

242
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,050
that you plug it into that this is a

243
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:18,970
keyboard and it types it as if someone

244
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,579
is typing the commands in to the

245
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,899
computer that's how it subverts the

246
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:28,329
actual any data loss prevention software

247
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,220
so the bash money is basically the same

248
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,779
thing except for you can put two

249
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,260
payloads on it it's got a three-position

250
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,970
switch and you can't expand the memory

251
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,500
whereas you can on the rubber ducky

252
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,560
because on the back side there is a

253
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,600
micro SD card additionally for this

254
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,949
you'll obviously need a computer you

255
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,750
don't need it on-site with you although

256
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:50,649
you could you could do some stuff with

257
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:54,370
it if you would like you need volatility

258
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:56,079
which is included in both Kali and sift

259
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,140
which is the sands investigative

260
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,449
forensics toolkit and then you'll need

261
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,670
something to acquire the memory for a

262
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,400
Windows environment I recommend ftk

263
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,520
imager light because I don't like to pay

264
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,899
for things

265
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,170
and I also don't like to pirate things

266
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:15,020
so things that are around the price of

267
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,229
free to free 99 that's what I typically

268
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,660
go with and ftk imager light is free so

269
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,339
in terms of the process of the actual

270
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,550
social forensic ation here's what we're

271
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,529
going to do we're gonna gain access okay

272
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,699
how are we going to do this well we're

273
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,339
gonna have to do some we're gonna take

274
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,940
some time we're gonna run some ascent

275
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,470
investigations we're gonna find out

276
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,380
about the operations of the organization

277
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,790
we're going to find out about security

278
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,320
defenses they have in place we might

279
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,079
look for some specific employees to

280
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,810
target and we probably want to find some

281
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,310
specific employees that are off-limits

282
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,410
because for this we obviously don't want

283
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,869
to go targeting their technology

284
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,719
department specifically security you

285
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,610
probably don't want procurement because

286
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,690
they would have knowledge of an existing

287
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,970
contract and then additionally anyone

288
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,110
who's in a position that may have a lot

289
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,589
of memory

290
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,560
we don't want video editors with 64 gigs

291
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,450
of RAM and there's a reason why and I'll

292
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,579
explain it a little bit later but once

293
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,690
we're in we impersonate a forensic

294
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:20,989
consultant how do we do this hi my name

295
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,790
is so neat arc and I am a forensic

296
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,680
consultant with Stark Industries

297
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,959
we have been consulted by your company

298
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,329
because malicious activity has been

299
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,420
detected your computer itself does not

300
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,609
appear to be infected but another

301
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,469
infected machine on the network has been

302
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,910
communicating with yours and I just need

303
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,450
to take a forensic image so I can take

304
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,490
it back to my mobile lab and verify that

305
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,120
there's no malware on your computer

306
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:50,690
you've done nothing wrong so in doing

307
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,459
that we are initially scaring them we're

308
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,279
playing to that emotion but then we're

309
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,810
immediately bringing them back down by

310
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
saying we don't think you've done

311
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:02,029
anything wrong

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,589
so explain to them this is going to take

313
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,209
you know just a few minutes I'll sit

314
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,220
here you don't even have to log out I'll

315
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:08,209
just plug this in get the memory and

316
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,100
we'll be done

317
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,779
no big deal you don't even have to leave

318
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,720
in fact I would prefer you stay here

319
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,339
with me why because if they leave they

320
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
can go get coffee say something to the

321
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,570
co-workers about oh there's a forensic

322
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
consultant at my desk taking a memory

323
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,730
image

324
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,980
and it may just so happen that the head

325
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,529
of security is getting coffee and say

326
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,050
what forensic consultant and you're

327
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,550
busted but anyway you're going to build

328
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,290
that rapport and the whole time you're

329
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,639
there you need to be prepared to have

330
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,670
conversation and keep this person

331
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,899
engaged because at realistically you

332
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,719
don't even want them getting up to go to

333
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,660
the bathroom you want them right there

334
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,600
with you throughout the whole thing take

335
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,920
the image walk out the door once you're

336
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,209
out the door here's how you accomplish

337
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,769
pwnage so you load the image and when I

338
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,079
say load the image what I mean is you

339
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,240
plug in the thumb drive and you navigate

340
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:02,930
to that directory in either sift or

341
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,199
Khali so no big deals there once once

342
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,810
you are actually in then you use the

343
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,519
appropriate volatility models or modules

344
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,050
which I'll discuss a little bit later

345
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:18,319
and then you attain pwnage somewhat

346
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,149
different from these these creatures

347
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:21,740
from South Park the underpants gnomes

348
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,810
you actually have to have a defined

349
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,389
process to get there you actually need

350
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,630
to know what step two is and step two

351
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:31,130
obviously would be the modules so in

352
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,939
gaining access how are we going to do

353
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,410
this well vistaprint to my knowledge

354
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,199
Vistaprint doesn't care if you're an

355
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,829
employee of CrowdStrike fireEye

356
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,359
history and whoever they don't care all

357
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:45,680
they care about the credit card that

358
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,690
you're giving them is valid and you give

359
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,670
them a valid address so you can get

360
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,620
business cards made to say whatever you

361
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:57,319
want if you want an ID card a quick ID

362
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,750
card comm will do that to my knowledge

363
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:01,579
they don't vet them either if you're in

364
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,510
the United States and you run into sky

365
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,250
dog at a conference

366
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,279
he will make you badges in fact he made

367
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,500
my password inspector badge you probably

368
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,660
need a clipboard because everybody in

369
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,819
social engineering and especially Ginny

370
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,139
Radcliffe out of the UK always stresses

371
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,219
always carry a clipboard because it

372
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,399
makes it look like you're in a position

373
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,779
of authority and I mean realistically

374
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,130
you might need to write some stuff down

375
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,459
there's a couple things you do need to

376
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,819
write down when you're doing this so you

377
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:32,149
know take a laptop with a briefcase or a

378
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:33,740
backpack because if you do when we get

379
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,120
to the wireless portion that's something

380
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,649
that you can do

381
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,870
you could easily have another laptop

382
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,610
hanging out in your backpack running a

383
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,680
Wi-Fi pineapple or running your own

384
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,930
rogue access point whatever you want to

385
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:50,359
do and people are none the wiser and

386
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,739
then have your solid pretext and by

387
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,720
solid pretext if you're trying to be a

388
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,920
modern forensic consultant you probably

389
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,920
don't want to come dressed like this

390
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,009
although I could see Darrell over here

391
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,660
come in a dress like that so when we're

392
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,779
getting the memory image there's a few

393
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,519
things we need to take into account

394
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,480
especially in the United States and I

395
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,740
think it's becoming a worldwide

396
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:20,329
phenomenon now because of everything

397
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,670
that happened with Manning and Snowden

398
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:25,040
and all that stuff there everyone in the

399
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,410
u.s. is ultra trigger shy about letting

400
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,370
people remove things from work networks

401
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,719
on thumb drives so they've started

402
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,220
implementing data loss protection

403
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,019
software so with that there's a lot of

404
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,420
different ways that it works but the way

405
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,550
that we're focusing on for this is not

406
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,439
allowing to write to the thumb drive and

407
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,389
that could complicate your process just

408
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:49,399
being honest because through this

409
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:51,050
process I've through the research

410
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,819
associated with this presentation I

411
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:57,050
learned quite a few things that are

412
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:58,610
highly applicable and could be they

413
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,740
could be deal-breakers for you but

414
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,839
anyway with these we have the assumption

415
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,000
that they are or they are not using data

416
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,029
loss prevention software so if they

417
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,279
aren't you can use a regular USB device

418
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:13,520
if they are using it you're pretty much

419
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,898
limited to a rubber ducky and then if

420
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,589
you use a rubber ducky you have to

421
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,750
understand

422
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,609
ducky script and ducky code which are

423
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,949
proprietary languages used to execute

424
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,119
things within the rubber ducky if you're

425
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,559
going to try to write to the rubber

426
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,859
ducky you have to flash the firmware

427
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,360
with the firmware called twin ducky and

428
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,559
then if you're going to actually get the

429
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,469
memory image and this is the thing that

430
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,520
the preconceived notion that completely

431
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,720
shattered my entire hypothesis with this

432
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,418
you have to have some sort of admin

433
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,070
rights so if the user that you're

434
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,470
sitting with and you've convinced to let

435
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,809
you do things is not an admin whether it

436
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,880
be local or domain you're not going to

437
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,360
be able to get a memory of it

438
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,450
but there's more that you could do so

439
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,740
you may need to run some powershell or

440
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,200
whichever language is appropriate

441
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,590
privilege escalation scripts so there

442
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,919
are a few out there like level up unix

443
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,030
Pervez check various things like that

444
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,900
then once you actually get that

445
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:15,928
privilege escalation run ftk imager take

446
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:18,970
the memory image and get out like quick

447
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:22,450
so realistically that would be the

448
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,169
process if they don't have the DLP then

449
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,309
basically it's used the USB device

450
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,010
consider you may have to do privilege

451
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,000
escalation so have your scripts on it

452
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:35,890
capture the image walk out the door so

453
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,210
but with this we need we need a little

454
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,830
bit of ocean we need to know about the

455
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,409
culture of the organization are our

456
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:45,370
users trained for this kind of

457
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:47,409
shenanigans some probably are so you

458
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,178
want to try to find the naive users so

459
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,100
if you can find their employees on

460
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,659
social media I always recommend looking

461
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,750
for the ones that are always doing the

462
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:58,570
quizzes on Facebook about what does your

463
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:03,190
name tell you about your spirit animal

464
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:05,860
or something to that effect yeah I'm not

465
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,419
a fan of those quizzes it took me two

466
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,610
years to break my mom of doing those

467
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,470
quizzes like mom how much information do

468
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,209
you give those she's like I only answer

469
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,490
like five questions I looked at I was

470
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,960
like well no wonder somebody got into

471
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,049
your email you basically reset your

472
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,880
password for them so I mean look for

473
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,799
those types of people when you're

474
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,150
considering the platforms that they use

475
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,059
and you can find that via the career

476
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,610
pages I mean especially if they're using

477
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:34,120
a Mac this whole bag is full of nothing

478
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,620
but dongles for this Mac so if they if

479
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,439
you're going into a back shop you

480
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,260
probably need the dongles and there's a

481
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,299
reason why I mean if you're a forensic

482
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,350
consultant hired by a company you should

483
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,970
already know what the environment

484
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,139
consists of and you should already come

485
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,740
prepared because that's gonna make

486
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,570
whoever you work for look bad so make

487
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,190
sure you have that and then it'll also

488
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,470
help you preload any software that you

489
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,760
need so that'll tell you do you need to

490
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,760
be running with Python do you need to be

491
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,080
running with PowerShell what do they

492
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,910
have the OPM

493
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,149
you may be able to find that out using

494
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,890
Oh send my favorite places for such a

495
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:13,330
thing would probably be the career site

496
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:16,840
and the resume pages on indeed I'm not

497
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:18,639
sure what platforms are used over here

498
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,959
I've seen some international postings on

499
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,230
indeed so I'm not sure if you have other

500
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,130
things as well Glassdoor if that's used

501
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,840
over here as well

502
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,550
company reviews that's a good place as

503
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,470
well you also want to know about their

504
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,139
antivirus and their endpoint detection

505
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,940
and response software because if you're

506
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,410
going to have to do privilege escalation

507
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,670
you're probably going to need to know

508
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,230
what they're using so you can actually

509
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:44,050
test it and make sure you can bypass

510
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:45,640
whatever they have so make sure user

511
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,040
rights obviously you want to target

512
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,690
someone who has admin rights and then

513
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,270
the culture and in fact are and how much

514
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,720
time it's going to take you to collect

515
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,370
so your limitations the user itself the

516
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,620
user may just say no and threaten to

517
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,239
call security if that's the case bye-bye

518
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,860
I'm gone I'm gonna go find somebody else

519
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,150
I'm gonna go hang out in the smoking

520
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,290
area and I'm gonna wait until people

521
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,610
come out on their break and then I'm

522
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,040
gonna follow someone in until then the

523
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,899
same thing

524
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,800
user permissions if they're not admin

525
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,910
you might be in for a rough ride

526
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,320
vulnerability management posture if

527
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,670
their vulnerability management is weak

528
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,720
you have a better chance of privileged

529
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:25,780
escalation so and then time through my

530
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,140
research on ddr4 it takes approximately

531
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:33,010
two to two and a quarter times the

532
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,510
number of gigs of RAM in minutes so for

533
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,550
two gigs of ram it took me four and a

534
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,670
half minutes for 12 gigs that took me

535
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:42,280
about 26 minutes to collect the memory

536
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:45,460
image so keep this in mind this is why

537
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,600
you don't want to go for someone with 64

538
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,520
gigs of ram because you're gonna be

539
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,159
sitting there for two and a half hours I

540
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,720
can entertain someone for four minutes I

541
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,360
mean apparently I've already entertained

542
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,800
people for about twenty here so I mean I

543
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,159
could probably already collected 12 gigs

544
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,550
of ram with this two and a half hours

545
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,970
I'm struggling to entertain myself just

546
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:10,770
to be honest so within using volatility

547
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:15,670
about volatility it's an open source

548
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:17,440
memory forensics tool it was a

549
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,780
initially just volatility and then at

550
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,150
Fort so some of you may be familiar with

551
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,700
the tool called recall that's maintained

552
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,680
by Google now and part of Google Rapid

553
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,210
Response that is a fork of volatility

554
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,880
they basically came from the same source

555
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,000
code but they're not quite the same

556
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,450
anymore it is native to both sift and

557
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,040
Cali I've looked at the modules included

558
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,350
with Cali and the modules included with

559
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,510
sift I will tell you that for the most

560
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,780
part I would use sift for this because

561
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:49,120
you have a lot more to choose from in

562
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,370
terms of the modules although with that

563
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,139
being said you can just go and either

564
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,330
write your own module or download

565
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,030
modules from github or other locations

566
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:01,710
to put on to the system as well it's a

567
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,760
little bit trickier so there's that but

568
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,050
you don't have to confine yourself to

569
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,690
this I mean if you wanted to install

570
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:12,280
volatility on a on a vanilla debian box

571
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,020
you could do that and you can put

572
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,020
whatever modules you want on it so

573
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,810
variables so in the syntax of doing

574
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,610
volatility it's ball dot pie and then

575
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,139
typically you have to use the minus F

576
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,919
switch to show which file you're

577
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,490
targeting and then - - profile to say

578
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,100
this is the plot the profile we're using

579
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:38,410
you can actually do export volatility

580
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,889
underscore location or profile and yes

581
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,420
those are three slashes on purpose and

582
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:47,650
define this so that you can just do ball

583
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:50,650
dot pie whatever module con scan me me

584
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,000
cats whatever and that's very important

585
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,650
because also you remember I said you had

586
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,820
a you might need to take a clipboard cuz

587
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,610
you might need to write something down

588
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,230
in the Windows environment you while

589
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,879
you're collecting this memory image you

590
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,230
probably also want to open up control

591
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,600
panel and look at system to find out

592
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:07,180
which build it is because you have to

593
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,240
define that if it's Windows 7 you have

594
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:13,330
to say Windows 7 x86 underscore service

595
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,490
pack 1 whatever with Windows 10 it's

596
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:20,560
Windows 10 underscore 1706

597
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,260
or whatever so you need to know that and

598
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,300
you can do it there's actually a module

599
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,860
for that it's called image info it's the

600
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,950
third one down from the left here you

601
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:33,158
can do it but it is a very tedious

602
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:35,070
I attempted this on 12 gigs of RAM I

603
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,169
kicked it off before I went to bed I

604
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,779
slept my full four and a half hours that

605
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,269
I typically sleep and it was still

606
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,769
running when I got back up and I killed

607
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:47,440
every other process I could possibly

608
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:51,490
kill so that it had maximum access to

609
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,929
memory took a long time so if you can

610
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:57,669
have that in advance it's gonna make it

611
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:59,620
easier so other things you can do anyone

612
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:03,940
ever heard of a thing called passing the

613
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:06,518
hash yeah familiar concept well you can

614
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,200
get the hashes via hash dump if you have

615
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,789
the memory image and you execute hash

616
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,450
dump you're going to see the hashes

617
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:15,970
contained within that system me me cats

618
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,289
same thing the one thing I will tell you

619
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,419
is the version of Windows 10 that I

620
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:21,730
tested this on me me catch was not a

621
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:23,799
very big fan of it I didn't get a whole

622
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,710
lot out of me me cats but as we know

623
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:29,039
with me me cats everything it's a game

624
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,519
of cat and mouse something is found

625
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,299
something works Microsoft's fixes it

626
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,710
something has found something works

627
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:40,269
Microsoft fixes it vicious cycle so me

628
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,820
me cats may or may not run but there are

629
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:45,549
other things you can do things like Khan

630
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,168
scan and net scan for example you're

631
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:51,070
familiar with the netstat command write

632
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:53,019
net stat - na or all that fun stuff it's

633
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,539
basically the same thing so you can see

634
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,580
which systems this is connected to and

635
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:00,220
which systems were connected to it on

636
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:04,600
which ports so that's going to help you

637
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:07,570
enumerate the internal topology dump

638
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:12,009
certs that's going to be getting like

639
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:14,678
RSA certificates and such ie history

640
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:17,470
Chrome and Firefox if you know your

641
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:20,860
users or your target users browsing

642
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,720
habits even if you're gonna come back in

643
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,229
social engineer a different way say a

644
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,320
fish you now know where they're going so

645
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:32,679
you can actually like get laser precise

646
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,100
with a spear fish and say I know that

647
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,570
you like to go to Tropicana calm

648
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,020
would you like free orange juice for

649
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,909
life they go

650
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,560
tropicana calm everyday what can I say I

651
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,330
picked it up in their browsing history I

652
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,200
mean who doesn't want free and orange

653
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,169
juice for life

654
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,450
I think I'd get tired of it but anyway

655
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,950
you can even also take screenshots you

656
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,240
can take a look at what's on their

657
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,500
clipboard so what they've been copying

658
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,220
and pasting and so many other aspects I

659
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:06,010
mean possibilities are near endless so

660
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,360
it's it's really it's really stealthy as

661
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,950
well because the only chances of

662
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,280
detection here comes the mitigation part

663
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,950
that you have are the physical detection

664
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,680
of you coming in and out of the facility

665
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:19,240
the user that you talk to going to

666
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,970
management on you and then once you're

667
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,680
actually plugging in you have the the

668
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:28,930
plug in and unplug events associated

669
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:32,160
with the USB device and then you have

670
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:34,690
the process execution for ftk imager and

671
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,980
the privilege escalation to get that

672
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,920
those are your only events so unlike a

673
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,710
lot of other things this is not very

674
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,890
noisy so you quite literally can do it

675
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,200
with just a few events obviously if you

676
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,140
start running things like power up or

677
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,260
other privilege escalation and utilities

678
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,700
that's going to become very noisy so

679
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,320
consider that within your detection

680
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:05,160
model so with your limitations the

681
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,409
operating system as I stated before

682
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,500
Windows 10 and mini cats the last time I

683
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,180
tested it don't play nice together ftk

684
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,580
imager light only works on Windows but

685
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,430
if you want to do it on Mac you can use

686
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,879
recall there's a thing called lime for

687
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:23,590
Linux I will say that if you can find it

688
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,050
someone on Windows 7 go for it because

689
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,850
it's gonna be a lot easier it's gonna be

690
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:31,860
hanging wide open and then of course

691
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:34,689
you've got time and regarding the time

692
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,919
that's really going to be something that

693
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,150
you're gonna have to play your improv

694
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,130
and your acting game on because you have

695
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:44,710
to keep someone entertained for that

696
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:47,940
time frame so moving into the Wi-Fi

697
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,930
portion why are we going to do this well

698
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,600
sometimes things just don't work out

699
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,360
right we might not have luck with our

700
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,289
USB devices they may actually have

701
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,508
they're USB ports physically shut in

702
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:02,080
some way shape or form they may be glued

703
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:04,119
shut

704
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,309
cemented shut something to that effect

705
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:09,279
we might not be able to do it we may

706
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,809
have gotten shut down okay

707
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,850
but we still want access because we're

708
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:17,080
persistent people that's how we are the

709
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:20,080
this this community of info ii hackers

710
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,869
they we as a whole we are probably the

711
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,970
most determined and persistent group of

712
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:27,970
people we don't take no for an answer

713
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:31,090
for the most part certain instances we

714
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:33,850
most certainly do but we just have that

715
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:37,059
drive to learn and do more and solve the

716
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:40,570
problem so why not find a workaround

717
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:42,220
right so with it with a rogue Wi-Fi

718
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,710
access point or just wireless hacking in

719
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,749
general it's not hard to get an alpha

720
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,480
network card in fact I've got one right

721
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:54,789
here and it cost me in u.s. dollars

722
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,590
about fifty five dollars it's got it's

723
00:29:54,789 --> 00:30:00,059
the dual band so it works all the way up

724
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:03,249
to eight oh two point eleven AC and

725
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:05,799
honestly it's injectable meaning that

726
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:08,009
you can inject packets and do things

727
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:12,249
like your D authentication and your fake

728
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:15,549
authentication with in Cali interact

729
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:17,710
with the the aircrack-ng suite it's not

730
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,809
that hard to do and then from there once

731
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,779
you're on that network as packets are

732
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:25,330
flying around quite literally just zoom

733
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:27,249
in right by you you can actually run

734
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,678
things like responder and other

735
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:33,009
utilities to gain access a different way

736
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,629
and depending on the organization's

737
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:36,669
posture they may be logging it they may

738
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:39,969
not they may be even if they are logging

739
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:43,059
it they may be pumping those logs into a

740
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,429
sim and analyzing monitoring for

741
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:48,039
detection they may not be so that's

742
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:50,109
something to keep in mind if you want to

743
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,070
go with the fake Wi-Fi access point

744
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:56,408
there's two ways to go about it you can

745
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,609
set up the alpha card you'll need two of

746
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:58,899
them to do that though because you're

747
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:00,340
gonna have to pass it through you're

748
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,080
gonna have to have one saying I am

749
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,749
whatever network you say you are you're

750
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,158
looking for and the other that's

751
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:09,160
actually connected to the real network

752
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,990
so they can actually pass through

753
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,000
and if you have a like an internal

754
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,980
wireless card or you're on Ethernet that

755
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,539
works too it'll just pass through your

756
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,090
computer which creates good pcap

757
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:21,220
opportunities or you could just use a

758
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,379
Wi-Fi pineapple it doesn't have to be a

759
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,809
tetra it could be a nano it doesn't

760
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,789
matter it's the hack five products if

761
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,918
you want to see one I've got one with me

762
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:32,950
I can show you after the presentation so

763
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:38,039
it's really not that challenging so we

764
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:42,880
are getting to the demo period so let me

765
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:45,158
you know I'm going to show a little bit

766
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:56,730
of stuff here so we'll start out with

767
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:56,730
the wireless piece wrong way

768
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,449
so this is just looking sniffing

769
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,340
wireless networks to try to find the

770
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:20,769
pineapple as we can see at the very top

771
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:23,519
it says pineapple underscore be1 e

772
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:25,659
that's the last part of the MAC address

773
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,120
but if you want to find my Wi-Fi

774
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:31,240
pineapple now if I'm running it I assure

775
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:35,559
you that the SSID for it is not a

776
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,690
pineapple not underscore a underscore

777
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,769
pineapple I think there might be an

778
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,559
underscore after that too

779
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:45,610
anyway so that's one of the simple

780
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,799
things of going that route so keep in

781
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:53,408
mind that with a Wi-Fi pineapple even

782
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:55,750
though it's an excellent utility I'm

783
00:32:53,409 --> 00:33:02,169
just trying to find my mouse again you

784
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:06,159
still can get caught so for cracking

785
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:09,370
Wi-Fi I kind of just play with the air

786
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,940
crack sweet in this but basically this

787
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,139
is just showing how simple it is with it

788
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,000
as long as you've got the injectable

789
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:18,549
package we've got it okay we're getting

790
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,590
it started there's Ehrmann there's all

791
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:26,200
the networks so we're going to choose

792
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:27,639
one here so we choose Y Jitsu okay so

793
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,130
we're doing this what we're looking for

794
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:37,000
is hashtag data we're looking for that

795
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:40,720
count to go up so here we're just

796
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:48,760
playing with some stuff this is the help

797
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:54,809
page from air crack so slowing it down a

798
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:57,158
bit here basically what we're doing is

799
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,600
we're going that's actually D

800
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:59,889
authentication so this is basically a

801
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,330
denial of service on the network and

802
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:03,760
it's going to require anything else to

803
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,199
reconnect and that's going to steal

804
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,760
those initialization vectors but our

805
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:13,780
data count is still at zero because this

806
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:15,570
is a wpa2 Network so doing some more

807
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,770
stuff this was a lot of trial and error

808
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,569
this is before I took offense of

809
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,099
securities Wireless course so I'm a

810
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:22,090
little bit all over the place with this

811
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:24,610
I apologize

812
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:28,000
that but okay now we see the counts

813
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:30,820
going up we're at about 2,000 where if

814
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,250
oh no I'm sorry we're 14 we need that to

815
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,680
go up significantly because typically it

816
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,159
takes about 80,000 packets of the data

817
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:47,699
packets to actually be able to conduct a

818
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:47,699
crypt analysis so as we near completion

819
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,989
we're gonna bump it ahead a little bit

820
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:59,950
okay so now our data packets are up to

821
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:05,520
1700 and this is aircrack itself going

822
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:11,080
and it took 29 minutes 12 seconds

823
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,820
password was scooped 2009 and the s was

824
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,150
capital meaning we used three of the

825
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,640
four typefaces for many organizations

826
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,960
governments included this is a nine

827
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,589
character password which meets

828
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:31,990
complexity requirements so the moral of

829
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:35,890
that story with regards to WPA is wpa2

830
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,720
is strong but it's based upon the

831
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,310
quality of your password so look at

832
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,140
things like the e FF high entropy

833
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,820
password list introduced special

834
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:47,640
characters I love throwing spaces and

835
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:52,060
things because it it's just fun so let's

836
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:55,080
let's take a look at some Windows seven

837
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,080
memory analysis

838
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:09,349
so as you can tell this is on sift so

839
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:11,720
there's the volatility profile

840
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:18,589
volatility location setting that right

841
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:20,959
now and for this I named my thumb drive

842
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:22,990
leg for Co for legitimate forensics

843
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:29,800
company because we're totally legitimate

844
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:29,799
so in that case let me go back briefly

845
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:39,890
so right now here's Mimi Katz so there's

846
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:47,210
the passwords associated with this

847
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:50,058
Windows 7 system out of Mimi cat's net

848
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,609
scan so this quite literally is showing

849
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:56,329
us almost identical to what we would see

850
00:36:52,609 --> 00:37:00,940
in net stat so here we see something

851
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:02,900
connected on HTTPS there's some SMB

852
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,869
quite a bit of stuff that we can take a

853
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:11,420
look at so a lot of stuff to consider

854
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:13,940
here a lot of stuff to work with command

855
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:18,020
scan so this is what was actually input

856
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:24,079
into the command line so into CMD dot

857
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:31,520
exe get SIDS that's going to tell us all

858
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:36,410
the users in the groups that was PS list

859
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,890
which if you're familiar I'm completely

860
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:42,410
drawn blank on what it was called anyway

861
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:45,078
there are four utilities within

862
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:48,680
volatility when it's called PS list PS

863
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,630
scan PS map and PS all if I recall

864
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,859
correctly and basically they look at the

865
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:56,890
processes the the pidz the process name

866
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:59,450
several aspects with it

867
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:00,740
Pro c'mon that's what it is Pro clone

868
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,169
and system on if you're familiar with

869
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:08,629
those these modules are almost identical

870
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:12,170
to that so now we're going to dump all

871
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,970
the DLLs so assuming we're in advanced

872
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,200
adversary and we want to do something

873
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,910
like process hollowing or

874
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,009
something that may involve injecting

875
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,750
something into dll's now we have a list

876
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,430
of what dll's are associated with that

877
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,770
we can manipulate those and see how we

878
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:27,049
can get like file size around the same

879
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,079
probably not the same hash something to

880
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,060
that effect so lots of things with the

881
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:40,369
DLLs there's a lot of chaos to be had

882
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:43,430
with that and all of these are dumped

883
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:48,079
into a directory so you can obviously

884
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:56,569
play with them outside of memory so

885
00:38:48,079 --> 00:39:00,380
there's the public certs and that's it

886
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:04,130
with that so as you can see with with

887
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:08,119
having the memory there there's a lot of

888
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:13,490
stuff you can do with it and here

889
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:15,800
actually is something I wrote in ducky

890
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:18,410
code I'll share the github repo with you

891
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,859
at the very end but if you plug this in

892
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,319
what it will actually do two things it

893
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,700
will actually steal the Wi-Fi password

894
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:28,310
write it to a file put it on the desktop

895
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,750
and put it on the thumb drive so even if

896
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,150
it doesn't go to the thumb drive you can

897
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,339
still have it on the desktop so let's

898
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,710
take a quick look at that so you plug it

899
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:42,200
in at this point if it's already plugged

900
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:44,359
in so we just verify okay there the

901
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,210
commands go so these are the things that

902
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,750
you've put in via ducky code and ducky

903
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,450
script

904
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:53,630
so with that you it's its own language

905
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:58,250
but it ran so as we can see here the

906
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:59,510
SSID was let's talk about hex baby you

907
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:05,119
know the salt and pepper song from the

908
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:07,130
90s and the password 6661 63 65 62 that

909
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:13,010
is the hexadecimal representation of the

910
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:16,010
phrase FAC EB so I like to use goofy

911
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:18,260
passwords like dead beef and dead BIOS

912
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,500
and Facebook so I was trying to use

913
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,660
Facebook with this one so you've pulled

914
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,819
it very simply out of the computer so

915
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,410
you can walk away with that go back to

916
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:28,460
your car without the computer connect to

917
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,040
the Wi-Fi network your

918
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,380
to the races as well your detection near

919
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,540
minimal and this is the perfect back-up

920
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:43,000
plan for if you cannot get a memory

921
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:46,099
image so going back to the presentation

922
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,310
I want to make you aware of a project

923
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,390
that Brian Austin and I and myself have

924
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,369
kicked off it's called through the

925
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:54,740
hacking glass it's a mentorship platform

926
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:58,190
free of charge we are in desperate need

927
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:02,240
of mentors we have about a 14 to 1

928
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,030
mentor to mentee ratio so basically we

929
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,549
aim to fill in the gaps between

930
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:09,410
certifications and education you can be

931
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,000
both a mentor and a mentee for more

932
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:14,029
information check us out on Twitter or

933
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,540
Facebook where we are both at hacking

934
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,740
glass upcoming speaking engagements

935
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,480
we've got the Diana initiative next

936
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,450
that's gonna be in Vegas adjacent to Def

937
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,589
Con I'm giving my Decepticon anti o cent

938
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:30,020
talk I'll be at hacker halted this year

939
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:32,150
and then Texas cyber summit in the

940
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,950
wildest hack and fest if anyone wants to

941
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,380
come to the u.s. to a core halted here

942
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,689
is a coupon code to get in for free

943
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,950
I can't help you with travel to get

944
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,220
there but I can help you with getting

945
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,509
into the conference itself so and if you

946
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,060
would like to come and actually take

947
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:51,349
some of the training

948
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:54,070
CHCH fi e si si si si so all that will

949
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:57,800
be offered there's a 15% off training

950
00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:01,369
coupon code as well so with that being

951
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,510
said we've got a few minutes to go here

952
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:04,220
I'll show you the links before I put

953
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,869
that one up so here are the links to

954
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:10,220
some of the things so Windows professed

955
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:11,660
check bypass UAC exploit suggestor all

956
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,520
these things these if you're trying to

957
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,868
go the privileged escalation route these

958
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,380
are resources that you could use to

959
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:19,790
assist you with that I've got a github

960
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,940
repo this is where I've got my script

961
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,980
stuff I right now I only have the Wi-Fi

962
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,640
stealer script there but I'm working on

963
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:31,790
others as I eventually find time like

964
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,310
you I'm I mean I'm pretty busy

965
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:36,200
ducky generator is another thing to look

966
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:39,650
for and it will actually help you create

967
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,328
the ducky code so and that's quite

968
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:50,209
possibly the hardest part

969
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:54,759
the whole process so any questions if

970
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:54,759
there are no questions that's all
