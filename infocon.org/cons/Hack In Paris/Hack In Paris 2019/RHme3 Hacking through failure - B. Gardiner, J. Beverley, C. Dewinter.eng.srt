1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,820
hello module ah good to see so many

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,049
people here glad to have the party in

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,179
the life and stuff so we're trying to

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,670
make this thing but we got to talk about

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,390
our failures here today which is not

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,279
something you see mentioned we did kind

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,949
of an engagement and as the slide says

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,789
we messed up quite a bit and we have

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,710
enough to talk about it so about us

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,920
we're your debtor employees where we're

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,309
at the time and we do CTF together I'm

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,300
Colin to winter I was born in 94 and

13
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,218
haven't used my life to the greatest

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,089
capacity so I don't really still batted

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,829
everything

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,770
Jonathan Beverly has a specialty in

17
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,140
static analysis and reverse engineering

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,829
and Ben Gardner on my left here has a

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,710
specialty in the hard way which is doing

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:01,020
things the hard way and hardware as well

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,879
yeah just to give you a rough idea it's

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,949
45 minutes of course we're gonna talk

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,350
about just through our competition that

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,170
we did the help we got stuff we

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,460
innovated things we failed of course

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,220
based on the other slides that is uh

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,509
quite the magic that's a lot so we'll

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,860
talk about that a lot and then we'll

29
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,140
talk about the times it wasn't awful

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,360
wasn't terrible didn't suck and that's

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,890
just that's you know the little bit when

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,009
we need a little lightning up in the in

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,150
the tone of the presentation and then we

34
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,530
might have some question time for

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,490
questions at the end if we're finished a

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,500
little early so this is the re

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,089
achievement III challenge board if

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,030
you've ever seen a CTF challenge board

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,700
it looks similar to this these are

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,119
approximately there's about 1315

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,000
challenges 19 challenges this entire CTF

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,060
took place over a four month period we

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,790
were granted somehow we managed to get

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,649
about a month and a half off of work to

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,360
work on this I don't I got it we gotta

46
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,360
give props to our to our employer at the

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,100
time I I don't know if we'd ever get

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,860
that type of stuff up again and this is

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,628
a little bit of the competition timeline

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,660
we're gonna be jumping around from place

51
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,799
to place to make sure this is keeps with

52
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,590
our narrative of just fail

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,750
tired and failing often but just to help

54
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,690
you guys out you're gonna see this in

55
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,210
the top right corner of the screen as we

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,710
go along just because as we did the

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,940
challenges chronologically it doesn't

58
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,510
match up with how I want to tell this

59
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,670
story so we've got three main sections

60
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,200
of this there's a pre qualifier that you

61
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,630
had to do for the IHM III there was

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,609
about you had to do a pre qualifier you

63
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,380
had to do that and then you would be

64
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,000
entered into a thing with five hundred

65
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,780
teams which you'd compete for the entire

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,450
four months and then we completed it and

67
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,020
we we we have this lovely section at the

68
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,940
end that is unbearable smugness so that

69
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,500
is just an unjustified sense of

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,340
accomplishment that we carried with us

71
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,990
and we still carry with us and it's

72
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,690
funny because we didn't actually win we

73
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:08,730
came third so that's not even the first

74
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,320
loser that's the second loser this a

75
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,820
little bit of the themes of what we want

76
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,220
to talk about we want to talk about that

77
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,239
failure as part of the process when

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,650
you're doing stuff that you've never

79
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,530
been out in your it side in your comfort

80
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,820
zone you're gonna fail that's okay we

81
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,480
want to talk to you about use outside

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,040
resources if you guys were on the boat

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,390
yesterday or doing any of those other

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,220
activities or just getting coffee you

85
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,109
know people here are very friendly they

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,550
really want to talk about you know what

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,920
interests them and things along those

88
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,820
lines so who really leveraged that when

89
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,250
you're trying to do something that

90
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,540
you're maybe not familiar with and

91
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,400
finally we use the term jugaad

92
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,620
innovation that is I think an indian

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,870
term we've got a just means hack it

94
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,400
together a little bit so this case we

95
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:55,200
have a motorcycle tire made out of boots

96
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:58,260
should work just as well well enough

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,459
yeah use outside resources we've

98
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,950
mentioned this a little bit people love

99
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,300
talking about things that they're happy

100
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,549
with and people also love talking about

101
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,500
themselves a little bit of case in point

102
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,480
here and maybe other stuff along those

103
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,530
lines

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,329
think about that boat you were on I

105
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,130
think how much skill was on that boat I

106
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,140
think about a small fraction that skill

107
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,279
you were if you could leverage the skill

108
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,779
of the people on that boat you can solve

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,548
almost any challenge in relatively quick

110
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,019
order you talk to many of those people

111
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:26,729
talk to them again and ask for their

112
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,630
help we have a very very special example

113
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,419
of this

114
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,800
we had been you worked on a reverse

115
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,240
engineering challenge which was one of

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,370
the things during the four-month

117
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,750
challenge yeah I just wanted to finish

118
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,490
one challenge that was a reverse

119
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,380
engineering Jonathan but you wouldn't

120
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,150
let me do it I was too busy finishing

121
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,310
the reverse engineering challenges yeah

122
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,359
thanks for that I did leave you one

123
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,380
though it's that that red bar that

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
starts at the beginning of the

125
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,930
competition and ends at the end of the

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,460
competition so he kept telling Jonathan

127
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,540
don't solve this challenge for me I just

128
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,979
want to get a hundred points on the

129
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,080
board and reverse engineering and that

130
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,600
red bar is spanning the entire length of

131
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,340
this competition when we come up on like

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,500
the very last day and I was like fine I

133
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,060
can't do it I do another it was noon on

134
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,710
the last day when you said do it and it

135
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,020
was three on the last day 3 p.m. when I

136
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,289
did it yeah so he actually just did it

137
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,289
on the last day so we have a lot of

138
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,090
special pet speciality here but still

139
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,630
everybody's got their their strengths

140
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,859
and we should always play to that as

141
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,260
well we were able to leverage some of

142
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,360
our co-workers experience we had a few

143
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,010
people who worked in kind of white box

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,660
crypto and some other AES

145
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,800
implementations so we were able to look

146
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,570
at these for some of the side channel

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,630
analysis which we were pretty green on

148
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,040
we had had some experience with but not

149
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,600
nothing super practical for most part we

150
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,370
were given like a half day here's what

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,570
side channel analysis is course like a

152
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,220
year before we started the challenge

153
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,080
that was all we knew yeah it was about a

154
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,650
one level up from leading the reading

155
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,890
the Wikipedia summary so any help is

156
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,150
better than no help we've got a a little

157
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,430
bit of help from people just from all

158
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,900
over just from asking random things

159
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,760
sometimes even a rubber duck can help

160
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,969
you if anybody's ever tried to debug

161
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,380
anything on code we were shipped an

162
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,870
extra board by a gentleman who was also

163
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,440
in the contest and helped us out with

164
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,140
that and we also got some assistance on

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,120
verifying what we thought was JTAG but

166
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,800
turned out to not be the exact case yeah

167
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,940
you skipped over Colin Oakland and I

168
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,170
want to mention that guy yeah that's the

169
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,940
guy responsible for the chip Whisperer

170
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,290
project he's really friendly and

171
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,700
outgoing and he would love to help you

172
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,980
site analyze things yep so you people

173
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,659
don't know everything but everybody kind

174
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,710
of knows something and so you can just

175
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,950
use that to your advantage when you're

176
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,090
in a in an instance where you're not

177
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,210
familiar with how you should get things

178
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,210
done

179
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,450
so let's talk a little bit about that

180
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,330
too god innovation a little motorcycle

181
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,800
made out of boots

182
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,530
if you don't understand the problem and

183
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,759
you get the flag in a CTF how many more

184
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,869
points do you have that a person who

185
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,999
does understand the problem that gets

186
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,860
the flag the answer is you have the

187
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:54,509
exact same amount of points these are

188
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,400
just about hacking it together and

189
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,259
getting it to work it doesn't you don't

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,008
need to understand a system 100% you can

191
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,060
understand it 50 or 60 percent maybe and

192
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,249
some sort of thing all in those lines

193
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,779
part of reverse engineering is finding

194
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,889
out what's the one or two percent that's

195
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,840
the most important part of the

196
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,999
application that does crypto or does

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,109
secrets or does assets and completely

198
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,680
ignoring the rest of the stuff that's

199
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,240
just like oh this is just UI stuff yeah

200
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,770
so this particular challenge was called

201
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,259
back to the future it's a little bit of

202
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,590
a hint to what's going on metaphorically

203
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,719
there's this car dashboard the the

204
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,609
physical board we had had a lot of cann

205
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,379
and automobile technology built into it

206
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,279
and the hardware and this board had a

207
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,949
pair of cane controllers they were

208
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,650
talking back and forth and you needed to

209
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,210
convince the central unit that the car

210
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,248
was going in 88 miles an hour and the

211
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,979
engine was running clean engine lights

212
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:45,960
are used on cars to indicate and almost

213
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,339
every error that happens that's why

214
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,419
engine light turning on means go to a

215
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,560
mechanic they can figure it out it

216
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,159
doesn't tell you anything other than

217
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,509
ever there was an error so all I had to

218
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,759
do is make the car look clean and be

219
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:57,899
going 88 miles an hour I get a flag

220
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,310
there were two messages that seemed to

221
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,399
control this one from the engine saying

222
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,569
things are good and one from the

223
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,069
probably the axle of the drivetrain

224
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,379
saying that it's going 80 miles an hour

225
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,020
I could make it clean I could make it

226
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,839
run and if I tried to do both I got

227
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,430
energy nervous and I was tuning it I was

228
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,050
tweaking and it was like everything is

229
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,729
good oh no there's an engine light

230
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,719
everything is good oh no that's too slow

231
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,969
everything's good and just did this and

232
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,740
this and this dropped a flag went back

233
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:27,330
down again I kept it live for no more

234
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,089
than five and a half seconds and I

235
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,919
needed it up for five seconds that was

236
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:33,240
it I asked them afterwards they said it

237
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,429
was deliberately designed to be asshole

238
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,899
there was no way to actually keep it

239
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,848
clean for an extended period of time

240
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,260
getting it to stay clean for a whole

241
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,940
minute was virtually impossible and

242
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,260
anyone who tried was me stuck forever

243
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,100
and so this this board that we were

244
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,019
talking about that was something that

245
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,640
was shipped twelve five five hundred

246
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,529
teams and you'd load the challenges on

247
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,779
top of it and then actually came with

248
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,730
this specific type of

249
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,199
instruction set which is AVR which is

250
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,439
what you'd use if you were working on

251
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:03,420
our dwee nose or something and we had to

252
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,199
create our own reverse engineering

253
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,060
module for it and this represents my

254
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,290
attempt at attempting to make it's

255
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,660
really good if you're trying to make a

256
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,730
wrap Jane it just returns all over the

257
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,230
place yeah if you this this is what the

258
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,999
disassembly looks like because I tried

259
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,589
to write my own macro very good for

260
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,569
return oriented programming and I didn't

261
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,350
even know you could return to registers

262
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:26,729
at once but here you go and we really

263
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,879
had to dig into this because the current

264
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,470
tool structure didn't exist for AVR at

265
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,610
that time for some of the disassemblers

266
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,920
we were using so we didn't use Collins

267
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,759
module in the end it really wasn't very

268
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,979
useful started calling the learning was

269
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,410
useful the learning was useful we we

270
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,870
took some of the machine readable

271
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,579
definitions that microchip provides for

272
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,379
the AVR and actually created a

273
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,699
microprocessor configuration module and

274
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,870
then we ran into a whole bunch of

275
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:56,609
different problems with X mega because

276
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,399
it actually puts the register file in

277
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,750
the memory map and the other types don't

278
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,970
which ended up being a problem we first

279
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,379
reverse engineered but then after we set

280
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,870
it up we had the advantage that if we

281
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,639
renamed areas in memory they would

282
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,069
actually also rename the registers so we

283
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,750
got to have nice Szell's at h's which

284
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,370
you see here and normally you don't get

285
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,629
to see the pairs of those and the Zed

286
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,279
Plus which is actually the important

287
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:19,889
thing all the registers here are what

288
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,470
they're one byte wide yeah and it's got

289
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:25,709
two byte addresses so there's a couple

290
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,750
magic registers zelans at HR 30 and 31

291
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,939
of I remember correctly and if you want

292
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,809
to do something like load from a

293
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,790
location in RAM which is the last

294
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,649
instruction up there it reads the

295
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,279
location from two registers at the same

296
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:41,639
time and this let us and I to easily see

297
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,160
how those all work together precisely so

298
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,529
we we actually found a blog post by a

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,790
Cisco team from our hme one where

300
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,079
they've just did the simple thing of

301
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,179
taking any sequential set of

302
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,888
instructions that use two pairs of loads

303
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,779
and squishing them together into a

304
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,209
pointer just assuming that would be a

305
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,100
cross ref out into a data space or code

306
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,258
space and doing that dumb thing actually

307
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,089
worked so they didn't ever publish the

308
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,800
code but we actually published all of

309
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,410
this stuff on github so if you want to

310
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,099
do some X mega code you can now do so

311
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,120
with x-ray

312
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,700
nice we also had a look at I mentioned

313
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,930
that the 10 1337 ther you notice that

314
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,330
the pointer isn't actually pointing to

315
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,839
the 30 30 1337 that the registers are

316
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,450
pointing to

317
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,580
that's because ROM and RAM are mapped

318
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,440
have independent addresses in this

319
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,300
Harvard architecture but are mapped into

320
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,370
the same address space so that's a

321
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,719
synthetic adjustment made by Ida so they

322
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,640
can coexist in the same address space

323
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,370
that's right they put the whole other

324
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,110
space just have a hundred thousand hex

325
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,350
up but that's how hacky some of this

326
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,820
stuff was but it works really well

327
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,800
speaking of hacky we tried to get a

328
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,260
bunch of signatures to match found out

329
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,849
that flare and flirt will not work with

330
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,770
Harvard architecture separate address

331
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,000
spaces it just will never go and we had

332
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,470
some help from the Aitu people and they

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,480
basically said nope just will never work

334
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,560
but it turns out that bin def because of

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,540
the way it has an intermediate language

336
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,760
would do matching we were able to look

337
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,280
at previous binaries from our HM e2 and

338
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,720
match you know a good portion of them to

339
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,630
get all the library functions right out

340
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,520
of the box using yep and on top of that

341
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,050
once we reversed one binary do two code

342
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,420
reuse we had most of the other binary

343
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,800
from it for free this also references

344
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,260
our talk to people in fact the guy

345
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,099
running hex raisin Ida I'm very friendly

346
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,720
very helpful yeah super elf okay so all

347
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,820
of that is published on github it has

348
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,230
other stuff too like scripted set up for

349
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,300
doing loader loops and getting data

350
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,620
copies in a memory and it even identify

351
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,870
stack variables which is something that

352
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,610
you know none of the plugins will do

353
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,440
presently so if you want to get some X

354
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:40,260
mega reversing please we'll use our

355
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:42,270
plugins so speaking the other half of

356
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,710
the infrastructure on top being able to

357
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,930
reverse AVR we need to be able to do

358
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,340
side channel analysis this is the setup

359
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,530
we eventually went with after a whole

360
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,700
bunch of trial and error the important

361
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,970
parts are those things

362
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,710
that's our picoscope that's a battery

363
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,660
pack which is the stable power source

364
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,100
when you're doing power analysis you do

365
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,439
not want to be running on the mains that

366
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,150
that moves a paramount you absolutely

367
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,550
positively do not want to be using a USB

368
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,250
port on a desktop the power things on

369
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,930
those are incredibly unstable that

370
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,140
jtagulator in there is a two hundred and

371
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,969
eighty five dollar transistor yeah it

372
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,189
just takes to want lines in and puts one

373
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,540
line out it's really that dumb and that

374
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,950
board in the bottom left with all the

375
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,099
wires going into it that is the target

376
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,100
board

377
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,960
there's one other thing that's hidden in

378
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,390
the middle and that's not a legal USB

379
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,580
cable that's a split data power line so

380
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,960
the power from the board and the

381
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,670
jtagulator are going into the battery

382
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,800
pack but the data from the board is

383
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,329
going into the desktop it turns out that

384
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,069
they were close enough that they could

385
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,080
pretend they had a shared ground and

386
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,790
things worked out this allowed us to

387
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,960
have the isolated power on the target

388
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,520
systems but still have live

389
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,600
communication between the two so that

390
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,600
they could actually talk to each other

391
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,860
we were absolutely blessed in this

392
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,480
particular case because we had

393
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,010
co-workers who did side channel analysis

394
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,630
professionally we could borrow their

395
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,700
riskier inspector license which meant we

396
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,490
had $30,000 worth of software to throw

397
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,680
at this target and we got to learn what

398
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,390
all those graphs on the screen are the

399
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,849
one on the right that's hidden is a

400
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,740
power analysis each one of those thick

401
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,110
vertical chunks is a single round of AES

402
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,540
the big thing on the left is an

403
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,010
autocorrelation plot which shows what it

404
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,620
looks like when you compare the power to

405
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,870
itself makes a nice big grid and again

406
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,740
we're talking rounds of AES fake rounds

407
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,720
actually mostly in that particular

408
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,490
picture but the point is you can clearly

409
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,690
see the structure of the program just

410
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,690
written out there in the power traces

411
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,220
yeah I mean we really wanted the chip

412
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,080
Whisperer to work calling a Flynn is a

413
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,970
super nice guy but at the time that we

414
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,910
were using this thing it was migrating

415
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,100
from three to four and also the Python

416
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,750
split was happening to so we ended up

417
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,130
writing something in for having a not

418
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,840
work trying to back for and then having

419
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,090
that not work because dependencies

420
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,500
weren't available we also ran into a

421
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,880
problem with the FPGA where you're

422
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,880
trying to do glitching and the FPGA

423
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,560
would actually lock it's one-shot like I

424
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,150
love this project I wanted it to work

425
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,160
apparently this stuff is resolved but it

426
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,530
was just a case of like this thing just

427
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,660
wasn't working for us too bad move on

428
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,680
six months earlier or six months later

429
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,199
it would have been the right project to

430
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,290
use at this point at this time just just

431
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,200
a big pile of no this is actually the

432
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,490
thing that let us win we got through two

433
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,870
of the side channel analysis program

434
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,950
problems and as far as I'm concerned

435
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,430
that's a win for us because we didn't

436
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,810
need to do it when we started JLS CA I

437
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,359
like to pretend that stands for the

438
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,949
Justice League a side channel analysis

439
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,300
but it doesn't it stands for julia side

440
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,610
channel and it's

441
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,979
rate it's this really bizarre kind of

442
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,450
scripty kind of seee language that lets

443
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,860
you do all sorts of math operations

444
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,630
natively but it's written by

445
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,980
mathematicians so so yeah those are

446
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,320
unicode operators in the middle of your

447
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,470
code because the the caret has to be

448
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,600
saved for exponentiation you can't do a

449
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,010
purpose that Forex source and then

450
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,830
there's one other really weird thing

451
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,110
here which is that my everyone knows

452
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,700
anything about crypto there's no reason

453
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,360
ever to add one to a value that's going

454
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,370
through an sbox

455
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,770
but i have to for this code to work and

456
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,440
the reason for that is that arrays start

457
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,060
at one I beat my head against the wall

458
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,290
for a month over a race starting at one

459
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:19,420
you that there's a reason we mock it

460
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:21,370
it's terrible brute forcing okay well

461
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,290
sure so we had we have a challenge car

462
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,850
key fob and all they told you is that

463
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,770
you had a scan chain and you had to

464
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,050
figure out how to give the right

465
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,490
response to a randomize challenge that

466
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,439
this chip would give back to you and

467
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,750
after you know you can see the time line

468
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,650
up here it took us you know

469
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,180
three-quarters of the overall time of

470
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,370
the challenge to figure this one out and

471
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,290
we just had to basically kind of fuzz

472
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,240
this scan chain that was implemented in

473
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,990
software and eventually we figured out

474
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,060
that you know there's a there's

475
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,980
particular bit that you set when you

476
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,140
shift it in and that tells it to send

477
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,460
back a challenge to you and then you

478
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,140
have to set another bit to say okay

479
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,360
here's my response you send that in and

480
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,680
if you get it right it it will give you

481
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,240
the correct flag if you get it wrong it

482
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,680
just kind of hangs and you have to reset

483
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
it so what you're seeing here is a

484
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,040
timing diagram that was hard-won by us

485
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,810
just kind of like banging on this chip

486
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,450
again and again and a lot of false

487
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,879
starts - including JTAG with a lot of

488
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,680
posters wasn't jtech but eventually when

489
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,180
we figured out how this challenge

490
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,230
response kind of worked we didn't have

491
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,730
enough information to even know what the

492
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,230
algorithm was we just know is like a

493
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,760
number of this big and you have to send

494
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,380
a number that big which is a huge space

495
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,210
of what possible algorithms you could

496
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,650
possibly use we figured it might be a es

497
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,960
related because a lot of the hardware

498
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,820
acceleration was AES but that still

499
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,920
meant that we had like you know hours

500
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,840
upon hours upon hours of brute-forcing

501
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,240
execute so I have pictures of me brute

502
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,429
forcing this chip in a box set up on a

503
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,420
car that's in the passenger side seat of

504
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,760
a car that's me on a plane brute-forcing

505
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,840
this is me boarding a plane

506
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,980
brute-forcing the attendant actually

507
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,110
wanted to hold it for me she said it

508
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,770
looks important I was like no no this is

509
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,750
too important for you

510
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,040
hold the guy behind me was not cool with

511
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,280
this he didn't think it was a good idea

512
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,260
at all a couple months later I actually

513
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,120
have a friend in the aviation I sac and

514
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,650
she she sent me this text message

515
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,780
exchange you can see here she says did

516
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,380
you board a Delta flight with a box of

517
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:08,080
wires and blinking lights are you stupid

518
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,040
yes and possibly yes and they're telling

519
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,230
me that they were trying to get me

520
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,940
banned the next day of course I found

521
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,340
out that someone else was trolling me

522
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,080
and they got her to contact me so

523
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,159
luckily I'm not banned from Delta

524
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,990
flights because they'll be a pain in the

525
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,880
ass well the thing was they forgot to

526
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,140
tell him he was being pranked they just

527
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,690
kind of forgot they told him he was

528
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,000
possibly on a no-fly list and he had

529
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,830
customer visits coming up and he was had

530
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,980
to do his regular job so it's a very

531
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,470
stressful three three four days and then

532
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,210
they got back and he asked her about it

533
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,860
and how's that how's that keeping me off

534
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,120
the no-fly list she's like oh that was a

535
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,429
joke

536
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,959
everything no you're fine they just

537
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:51,340
forgot to tell him they got me pretty

538
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:52,270
good yeah oh this challenge so keeping

539
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,760
in the theme with brute-forcing

540
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,050
sometimes you just have to do things the

541
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,400
hard way sometimes you're facing a

542
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,260
challenge you think there's cute

543
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,310
solutions they don't work you try their

544
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,500
things they don't work you just look at

545
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,700
it and be like okay I have two kilobytes

546
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,550
of binary it's not actually that much

547
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,070
binary I'm going to literally hand lift

548
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:12,280
all the assembly to see by myself and

549
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,740
then get given that C and an effective

550
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,120
emulator I'm going to debug it until it

551
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,370
is bug for bug compatible with the

552
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,479
original program and now I can work with

553
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:24,790
the C I I could the in the emulation

554
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,200
room was too slow it did not work well

555
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,780
enough for me to be able to debug this

556
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,340
problem in the emulator so I ended up

557
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,980
debugging it and C and my C actually

558
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,590
worked flawlessly eventually eventually

559
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,440
and I was able to find the problem in

560
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,980
the code that way so it was a method I

561
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,570
knew would work if I put in the day and

562
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:49,630
a half of solid work to lift all that

563
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:52,149
code so just in keeping mind which is

564
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,320
kind of getting it working this is as we

565
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,200
said before if the chip whisperer it

566
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,120
actually lock-on so for anybody it was a

567
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,400
transistor designed to push a lot of

568
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,178
power through itself such that it could

569
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,830
kind of

570
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,379
the power of the system we were working

571
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,109
on so if you stick that into the on

572
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:10,899
position it gets really hot and it gets

573
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:14,168
really hot really fast and you had a

574
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:15,399
glowing red resistor that he just kind

575
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,019
of ignored and you just be sitting there

576
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:19,899
and you go oh something's smoking and it

577
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,330
would be a resistor we actually had to

578
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,070
rebuild our own transistor and that one

579
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:28,418
on the left there is taken out of a

580
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:30,158
graphics card BJ I don't be G so that

581
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:32,169
was able to pull the power down to zero

582
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,279
volts in like a couple nanoseconds

583
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:37,929
something along those lines so as you

584
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,159
can see we just have to make and then

585
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,609
the right side we have kind of this this

586
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,749
wire box that we created and things

587
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,649
don't have to be pretty but they do have

588
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:49,029
to be magnifique

589
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:52,059
so in France I'll do I'll do that yeah

590
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,950
and and these are these are just ways

591
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,899
that we kind of set up this box and just

592
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,369
this this amount of wires and how we had

593
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:59,978
to to manage it in this in this

594
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:01,478
situation if you're familiar with the

595
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:04,200
picture on the right that is something

596
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:07,149
called pin lifting where you desolder

597
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,190
your chip in certain spots such that we

598
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:11,649
could get a voltage read across the

599
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:15,190
power lines of the thing we were working

600
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:16,539
on this is possibly the most important

601
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,009
and hardest part of the site channel

602
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,869
setup you can measure the differential

603
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:21,519
across that giant resistor on the left

604
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,019
which is so much easier than trying to

605
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,879
do it across the pins that your probe

606
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:29,529
literally can't fit around yep

607
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,119
so do tough things when you need to

608
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:32,320
sometimes maybe a hand lift see

609
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,629
sometimes you just need to brute force

610
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,418
on a plane and then never ever get on

611
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:39,158
another plane again and so me an

612
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:43,299
inelegant and gets you a flag still gets

613
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:44,769
you a flag yes mics yep but that but

614
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,658
that really wasn't what our thing was

615
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,979
about right our talk is re Jimmy three

616
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:49,929
hacking for failure so let's talk about

617
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:53,919
failure this section is gonna be a lot

618
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,269
about me this is yeah a lot of so we we

619
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,059
had to do a pre qualifier as we

620
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:59,739
mentioned and you guys were all busy and

621
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,940
I really wanted us to get into the

622
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:03,879
riskier hackney because I just thought

623
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,679
it was super cool so this is August and

624
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:07,509
I'm on vacation with my family and

625
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,729
they're asleep and I'm like trying to do

626
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,619
these qualifiers and you can see here

627
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:13,749
this is an execution trace and the green

628
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:14,320
and the red from the side channel marble

629
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,210
to look

630
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,530
what it does is it takes the little

631
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,540
reads and the writes and then it does

632
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,690
just correlation analysis to try to find

633
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,220
like an aes key so it did reliably find

634
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,870
an aes key you can see it right here and

635
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,580
it had a high confidence but I kept

636
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,229
submitting it as a flag and just going

637
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,060
like what is going on why isn't this the

638
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,390
flag the confidence is like right up

639
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,800
there and because I'm stupid I never

640
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,620
thought that this could have actually

641
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,300
just been asking and so we we actually

642
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,219
missed the qualifier it's not just

643
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,530
because of this failure but partly

644
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,280
because of my idiocy unable to confer to

645
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,399
ask you

646
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,790
so failing you know what fail move on

647
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,440
fail something else

648
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,240
so the atop C challenge the other side

649
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,680
challenge was the third of the can car

650
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,320
hacking challenge is the hardest one and

651
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,980
I spend an awful lot of time on this one

652
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,510
because well you see it had weird

653
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,710
backdoor capabilities and I figured I

654
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,760
had open the backdoor I figured how to

655
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,410
get through the backdoor I couldn't get

656
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,960
it to drop the flag I eventually put it

657
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,270
into the emulator figured out why it was

658
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,010
broken figured how was broken patched it

659
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,720
live in the emulator got it to run

660
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,440
through it dropped a hex string I'm like

661
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,990
great

662
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,450
I submit that I get nothing I got

663
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,820
nothing because someone else instead of

664
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,400
doing that had reported the error and

665
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,649
they'd fixed it and when they fixed it

666
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:43,210
it automatically cycled the flag so my

667
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:44,650
flag was invalid okay so this was a 250

668
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,040
point challenge the challenges ranged up

669
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,420
to 750 points despite being 250 points

670
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,909
it was possibly the hardest challenge on

671
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,540
the board two weeks full-time reverse

672
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,180
engineering once you had the exploit it

673
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,730
took 30 minutes to deliver the exploit

674
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,770
to the target board this is not remote

675
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,840
this is not something up this is

676
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,250
direct serial access to the board and it

677
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,590
still takes 30 minutes to get through

678
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,650
the exploitation path after you make

679
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:15,520
your exploit attempt the board will then

680
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:17,950
spend six hours processing this is a

681
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,900
busy loop with a counter so big they

682
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,280
needed to add another variable to track

683
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,720
it because it would have overflowed and

684
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,070
this this nice guy wanted to take the

685
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,000
thing away from where brute-forcing over

686
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,679
the weekend

687
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,570
and so I let him take it basked him to

688
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,180
check the console he carried it home

689
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,419
live in his trunk he pops it open and

690
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:40,450
nothing right there pat passcode log

691
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,100
nothing nothing nothing and then what

692
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,170
did you do and then I was like huh maybe

693
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,459
John didn't like flush the buffer of the

694
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,710
serial port yeah

695
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,500
flag like yeah so he had it sitting in

696
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,310
there and we almost lost we would have

697
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,360
thought there would be something wrong

698
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,310
with it so we would have lost maybe

699
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,780
another couple days plus another you

700
00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:00,970
know six and a half hours putting the

701
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:03,310
getting the response back glitch up so

702
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,990
we did actually get into some glitching

703
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,429
towards the end we never successfully

704
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,770
glitch one of the targets you can see

705
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:11,020
here a power trace showing like where

706
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,600
the LED turns on what a normal execution

707
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,889
would be intermixed with you know what

708
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,870
happens when you start glitching one of

709
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,460
the rails during processing the name the

710
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,709
game here was to actually find the right

711
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,130
place to glitch it to change a variable

712
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,630
to set a mask to clear so that you could

713
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,940
change execution and then get the flag

714
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,250
to drop up what we did manage to do was

715
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,980
actually do like an instruction glitch

716
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,840
and skipped one step so it went down the

717
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,030
right path but it never cleared the flag

718
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,970
so what you see here is you know after a

719
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,379
couple days of glitching it says

720
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,960
congratulations your flag is F F F F F F

721
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,580
F F so all we got was the mask out and

722
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,410
this was after multiple days to which I

723
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:51,939
replied no yeah yeah just to give it a

724
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,460
little update on the X's the X's told

725
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,780
you how many parts of your answer that

726
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,160
you put in were wrong and that was

727
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,020
constantly changing and so we were

728
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,940
trying to glitch the power while I was

729
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,500
checking how many were wrong such that

730
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,880
when it loaded it it would glitch and

731
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,440
then it would load it as a zero instead

732
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,970
of actually with the amount that was so

733
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,810
then it would skip over the one yeah

734
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:20,320
skip Wrong skipper wrong still wasn't

735
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:25,780
right yeah so there was a challenge that

736
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:28,780
was just called sonic frenzy so this is

737
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,950
it you'd connect some of the wires to it

738
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:35,800
and it would it would tell you in a

739
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:39,310
lovely lovely voice it sounded like a

740
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,200
Commodore 64 voice modulator exactly

741
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,220
what was wrong with your program and it

742
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,830
would say that back to

743
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,389
and you'd have to reconnect some of the

744
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,009
output wires to the input wires and it

745
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:52,269
was just a loopback system that was part

746
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:55,360
of it yeah and so we don't have sound

747
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:58,450
I'll bless you guys that a bit I don't

748
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,549
yeah we heard this this is a table that

749
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,110
we created though and this is all the

750
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:04,450
wires connected to all the other wires

751
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,459
so each time we did this entry in a

752
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,360
table you had to listen for about 30 or

753
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,820
40 seconds - welcome to the infotainment

754
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,709
xanthor and it would just keep going and

755
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,289
then it would be like in core or

756
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,059
actually correctly it would just be this

757
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:22,779
absolute pain and we get the messages

758
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:24,940
we've marked down each message and then

759
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:26,590
Ben was like huh I've tried all

760
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,090
possibilities I've graphed it out this

761
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,500
is no solution obviously I've made a

762
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,549
mistake I'm gonna go back and do it all

763
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,590
again yeah so he completed it he brute

764
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:38,049
force again and he posts two entire

765
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,408
tables worth of the things and the

766
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:43,629
problem came from

767
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,070
this graph do you see the a pins on the

768
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,269
bottom left this is actually a top-down

769
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,129
view of the board and where the pins on

770
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,779
it are you have to connect the a pins on

771
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:52,240
the left to the depends on the right and

772
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:54,429
by doing so in the right pattern you

773
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,019
make the thing think that a module has

774
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,759
been attached to it intraday entre

775
00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:01,419
unlock additional functionality that

776
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,250
functionality be dropping flags so Ben

777
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:05,500
here tried every combination of matching

778
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,059
the a pins to the D pins but he didn't

779
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,019
need to move the a pins what pensa d

780
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:13,418
need to move was that the PA pins over

781
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:15,700
here which on the silkscreen had nothing

782
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,409
to do with a at all but on the schematic

783
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,370
was obviously a so I just need to

784
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:26,830
actually read the schematic yep I'll

785
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:28,268
never learn my lesson sometimes you fail

786
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,320
because everything looks like a nail

787
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,210
when you have a hammer

788
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,639
we had a jtagulator you saw it earlier I

789
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,710
love the jtagulator and when we read the

790
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,969
car key fob challenge it really sounded

791
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,100
like this was JTAG right they said you

792
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,779
have a scan chain interface with a scan

793
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,840
chain to get the flag okay scan chain

794
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:46,480
JTAG obviously right more brute-forcing

795
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,949
we put a delay delay in this because it

796
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,899
was software emulated scan chain so you

797
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,340
had to go slow and we just left it

798
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,449
overnight scanning and scanning of

799
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,709
scanning and this thing would report

800
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,240
that it was self-destructing like you

801
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,900
wouldn't believe it didn't matter what

802
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,930
we tried this

803
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:03,130
not JTAG so that was not my fault yes

804
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:06,760
wasn't JT yeah well there's an awful lot

805
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:08,560
of time I'll take that was me for like

806
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,600
but that failure wasn't really your

807
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,120
fault well I think we just said it was

808
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,379
my fault oh yeah but car key fob in

809
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,679
general wasn't your fault it wasn't my

810
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,990
fault

811
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:23,950
no no no it wasn't his fault guys it

812
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:26,110
wasn't so this is another terrible side

813
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,180
channel analysis lesson it has to do

814
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:32,020
with the the confluence of the real

815
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,460
world and the CTF world are our friends

816
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,050
who work with us who do side channel

817
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,240
analysis they've to deal with real-world

818
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,730
systems which are noisy which frequently

819
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,010
have Hardware defenses side channel

820
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:46,630
analysis on a multi-threaded system is

821
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,830
always harder and so every time we told

822
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,910
them we couldn't manage to get a signal

823
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,610
out of this thing he said take more

824
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:54,310
traces at one point I was gathering I

825
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,469
was spending 16 18 hours just capturing

826
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,899
traces from this board I end up with a

827
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,850
quarter million traces it was like 10

828
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,700
gigabytes of data that I'd extracted

829
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,560
from this board looking for a signal

830
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,940
when you have 25 million traces 10

831
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,340
gigabytes of data trying to do an

832
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,660
elastic align which is like this complex

833
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,280
process where you try and figure out

834
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,590
what the exact line up between these

835
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,950
things are it will take two and a half

836
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:20,379
three days to execute we had a like

837
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,270
octo-core Xeon that they weren't using

838
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,940
at that moment that we could borrow for

839
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,680
a week or three and it was seriously

840
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,290
almost three days or just raw processing

841
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,240
and it turns out that elastic line was

842
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,350
not in any way helpful and that those

843
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,790
problems could be solved with less than

844
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,899
a hundred tricks or less than a thousand

845
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,879
traces so you when you're doing stuff

846
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:45,420
like this you'll fail it happens and

847
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:47,650
having us and it's also varying ways and

848
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,170
that's just kind of a thing of it but

849
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,550
the thing about failure is you fail

850
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,650
because you're trying to do stuff that's

851
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,830
new and different and and when you

852
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,870
actually end up doing it you get to

853
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:01,360
enjoy the Eureka's of your moment and

854
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,570
that's it's kind of a brain stamp up on

855
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,679
that most specifically as an example

856
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,740
would be our car key fob it actually was

857
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,380
not as fault I know we

858
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,659
put that out there for a second what it

859
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,840
actually happened is they had given us

860
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:19,340
another wrong version and what happened

861
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,500
was we sent you sent them the scripts

862
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,789
yeah we wrote scripts and they covered

863
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
every single possibility of

864
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:26,059
brute-forcing we just said look here's

865
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,950
the scripts where are we going wrong

866
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:30,080
that wasn't about like four days later

867
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,630
like yeah we made a mistake

868
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,408
yes turns out that all the the firm

869
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,360
herbs we were shipped were

870
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:38,000
individualized on a team by team basis

871
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,580
and there was a bug in that process so

872
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,899
as a consequence the vert the the master

873
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,760
version that they were testing worked

874
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:44,989
flawlessly but the individualized

875
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,149
version that they shipped to us were

876
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,890
broken and they didn't go back and test

877
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:50,719
the specific individualized version that

878
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,020
shipped anyone until this point in the

879
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,779
challenge yep so all that plain

880
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,120
brute-forcing was uh was in vain well we

881
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:00,799
got the whole story I don't actually

882
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:08,418
know what the solution is to this day so

883
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:10,010
maybe it wasn't in vain Impostors this

884
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:12,649
is a really fun side channel analysis

885
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,720
problem there were 16 rounds have you

886
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:17,418
looked at the power trace when you hear

887
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,039
there's 11 rounds of normal AES when you

888
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:20,539
see 16 rounds in the trace and there's

889
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,740
11 rounds real do you think there's 5

890
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:26,059
fake rounds right unless you're been and

891
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,190
so I spent a very long time reading

892
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:29,899
literature on fake rounds to hide and

893
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,700
defend against side channel analysis

894
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:33,979
trying to figure out how to move them

895
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,350
around what was it eventually been it

896
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,990
was hardware-accelerated AES John yeah

897
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,539
it was so every one of those 16 rounds

898
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,100
was an aes computation all by itself it

899
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:45,080
turns out that hardware AES is actually

900
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,459
faster than a single round of software

901
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,049
yes so I mean it took us another month

902
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,880
this sort of Ilya kishka kubbs attack

903
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:55,539
and make it actually work but at least

904
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,649
we're on the right channel at that point

905
00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:01,850
speaking of spending a month on working

906
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:04,158
this was me at like 9:00 p.m. in the in

907
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,510
the office know this one that that

908
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,080
notepad on the right is the genius

909
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:11,090
solution to it I was basically running

910
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,408
around the office cackling Eureka at 9

911
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,689
p.m. and these guys were asking what's

912
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,039
up and I just I like vague tweeted that

913
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,360
that image to them and then went to bed

914
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,279
yeah perfect makes perfect sense it

915
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,419
turns out that you need to know the

916
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:25,760
relationship between the

917
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,220
is happening in you need to which block

918
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,720
is processed after which block and for

919
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,300
optimization reasons they shipped it

920
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,470
from linear to mix column order it

921
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,210
doesn't make any sense unless you know

922
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,770
sectional analysis but the point is is

923
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,080
that they've made a really simple change

924
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,240
for optimization reasons and it broke

925
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:48,379
everyone's attempts to do Hardware and

926
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:50,240
analysis on hardware yes and other

927
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,410
instances I mean like so you have to

928
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,070
remember this is a four month long

929
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:56,630
challenge we got seventeen flags so I'm

930
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,610
not doing the math off my head but it

931
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,610
means like seven or eight days between

932
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,780
flags at their very least so you need to

933
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,919
maintain momentum you need to maintain

934
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,770
morale and that means you need to

935
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,630
celebrate your victories and enjoy it

936
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,730
because you're gonna spend long periods

937
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,740
without doing very much at all if you've

938
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,050
ever done a CTF and really struggle to

939
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:17,569
even get one flag and that's like a

940
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,950
weekend CTF imagine that being because

941
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,300
we had to there was a lot of tooling up

942
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:22,639
at the very starting so imagine doing

943
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,900
that for being in a CTF for three or

944
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,900
four weeks and not getting a single flag

945
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:33,500
- just as a summary we are unbearably

946
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,179
smug if you've met us we were here all

947
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,060
week so I mean maybe some of you know

948
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:39,440
already and we only came third and we've

949
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,739
decided to make this a talk and talk

950
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:50,030
about how much we lost in the entire

951
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:52,668
thing thanks yeah if you have any

952
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,820
questions we do have full write-ups yes

953
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:57,259
I did the right yeah in a previous

954
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,390
version of the talk we we were getting

955
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,280
on actually finish that right up but

956
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,470
that's all up on our github it's very

957
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,440
detailed we go into a lot of times if

958
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,640
you guys want to check out how we kind

959
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,920
of started from a elementary

960
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,250
understanding of side channel through

961
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,930
more in depth on the AVR scripts that we

962
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,700
kind of did more memory in-depth stuff

963
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,569
and if you just want to see how if

964
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,060
you're looking to get into reverse

965
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,970
engineering you know ask some questions

966
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,740
or even after I mean the one we're

967
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,450
talking over this but come find us and

968
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,750
we'll we'll definitely talk about it I

969
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,730
want to spend one minute shilling for my

970
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,040
side channel analysis notebooks Julia

971
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,540
loves to run in Jupiter notebooks so

972
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,520
there are two fully functional

973
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,350
jupiter notebooks that you can run that

974
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,270
will do side channel analysis live

975
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,029
before your eyes all the source code

976
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,830
that you need to do it is nearby or part

977
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,340
of the well-established ALS CA julia

978
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,660
projects and the the completed notebook

979
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,060
