1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,839
good evening

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,480
i was told i have a very specific ending

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,200
time because we have to go to the boat

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
so if you ask questions

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,480
i think i'm going to be in trouble

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,320
so i promise you there'll be no

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,160
technical discussion you've had enough

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,320
technical for today i think there's

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
some wonderful things that have been

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,840
discussed

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,400
let's just take it easy light soft maybe

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,519
gentle

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,160
and talk about philosophy

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
is that better than technical

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,960
one yay okay good

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
so we go forward then

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
great

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,480
um

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
this is the philosophy for analyzing

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,399
doubt and deception and it goes by many

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,680
names

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,360
uh it's been called incongruity analysis

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
it's been called

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,559
the theory of humor

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,039
incongruity theory

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,920
there's many names to it um

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,360
and a long time

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,400
i'd say uh 1880s or so there was a

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
student

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
of dr joe bell scottish physician

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,360
and he took and he learned from dr bell

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,680
what dr bell called the method

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,119
and this young person by the name of

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,720
arthur doyle

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,759
in 1887 created the world's most famous

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
detective sherlock holmes

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,799
from the theory of what we're going to

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,520
be discussing today

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,119
or not

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
is this the right one

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,399
so that's wrong

42
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,799
okay so

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480
agenda have to have an agenda

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,280
uh

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,959
epistemology

46
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,160
philosophy we'll get through the

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
philosophy real quick and we'll put it

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,239
to practical application as quickly as

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
possible so nobody gets hurt

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
so here everyone's favorite

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
rene descartes

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,239
the tree

53
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,599
is the key

54
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
it's a tree of knowledge most of you

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,280
probably are familiar with this

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
the roots metaphysics the trunk is

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
physics

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
and there are three basic branches

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
medicine mechanics

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
and ethics

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,840
but in all of these things there's

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,959
doubt and

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,640
one thing we learned from what descartes

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
teaches is it's not just important to

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
consider the tree but you have to

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
consider and investigate

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
everything that is related to the tree

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
where it's planted how much water it

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
gets how much care nurturing it gets and

70
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,840
so on so understanding the validity

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
of everything that

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
gives life to the tree of knowledge

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,280
is important

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
all right

75
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,400
so

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,599
let's talk the philosophy part

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,080
uh in the first meditation descartes

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
sets out and he explains uh several

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
arguments of doubt

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
of all his previously held beliefs

81
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,159
he's cautious

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
but a very objective observer to what's

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
happening

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
and he first observes

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
that the senses are sometimes deceived

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
this is key in what we do

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,840
he noticed that an object

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
might be

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,000
considered far away and small but his

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
senses are deceived because the object

91
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
is actually

92
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,040
rather big so it's not prudent to accept

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,879
what your senses can

94
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
feed to you

95
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
because you've been deceived by your

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,599
senses

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,199
and this happens to us in life all the

98
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,720
time

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
you might be able to identify

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
a commercial on tv you thought you were

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
going to get one product and you

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
received another product

103
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
you might have been sold something

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
and you realized when you got it home it

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,479
wasn't what you wanted the same concept

106
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
but descartes goes on

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,800
to argue that although this may apply to

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
this sensations derived under certain

109
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
circumstances

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,919
doesn't it seem certain

111
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,040
that as descartes said quote

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
i am here

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
sitting by the fire

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
wearing a winter dressing gown

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
holding this piece of paper in my hand

116
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
and so on

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
he pointed out that even though the

118
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
senses deceive us sometimes

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
what basis for doubt

120
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
would you actually have

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
that you're sitting here listening to a

122
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,280
discussion right now

123
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
why would you doubt that you're sitting

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
here listening to me

125
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
you see me on the stage

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,600
and you're part of this moment

127
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,639
fast forward

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
to something that stops us all from

129
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
being able to solve problems

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,039
and distinguish

131
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,639
between

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
reality

133
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,320
and something that's just not there

134
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,840
descartes

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
doubt was all based in the fact that you

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
could be in a dream right now right

137
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
but are you in a dream about being here

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,800
and therefore not actually here

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,199
and everyone here

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,600
we won't get that far into it but you

141
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,240
understand what it is

142
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
here you're fighting with yourself the

143
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
whole time there's numerous cognitive

144
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
biases that exist

145
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
you can be in a situation of information

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
overload

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
you could lack context in something

148
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
you can receive information

149
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,880
not in a timely manner and you have to

150
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,319
make a very fast decision

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
what should we remember what's the

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
takeaway

153
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
what's the key point that's trying to be

154
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,719
driven home

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
our senses play a game with us a very

156
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,080
dangerous game

157
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
that we're all too happy and all too

158
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,440
comfortable with

159
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,840
deceptions

160
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,880
two types of deception

161
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
that's what it boils down to

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
the art of deception studying deception

163
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,479
from magicians

164
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,560
to a car salesman who's going to sell

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
you the greatest automobile you've ever

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,759
purchased in your life and it's only

167
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
going to cost 500 euro

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,759
but it'll be great

169
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
and you'll drive it for 100 years

170
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
a type of deception

171
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
ambiguity

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,560
increasing

173
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,319
what does that mean

174
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
basically that means that

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
there is

176
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,599
a bunch of information

177
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,440
you're looking at

178
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
one piece of information you have

179
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
another piece of information and you're

180
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
getting

181
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,960
numerous feeds of information that are

182
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,319
coming into you

183
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,280
and you're receiving it through your

184
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
senses and you're trying to make sense

185
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,240
of what you see

186
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
the key with ambiguity increasing

187
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,359
is that your level of doubt

188
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
goes

189
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
up

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
you become more doubtful of all the

191
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,479
information that you're receiving

192
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,400
and you can't make sense of what the

193
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
truth is

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
and what's a dream

195
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
the m-type

196
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,479
is misleading

197
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
i may have the truth over here

198
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
but i'm not going to show you that i'm

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
going to show you something over here

200
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
that brand new

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
six-year-old

202
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
500 euro automobile

203
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,720
that's much better

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
because i know you don't have enough

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
money for it i'm going to sell you this

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,958
one right here

207
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,919
and you're going to love it you're going

208
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,279
to be happy with what i give you

209
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,279
the difference here

210
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
what you're sold

211
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
is going to decrease your doubt

212
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,760
because

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
you're being sold a very specific target

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
so you have a

215
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
where you become more doubtful more

216
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,359
confused

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
and m

218
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
misleading

219
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
where you are very certain that you're

220
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,560
making the right decision

221
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,479
you have no doubt at that point

222
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,839
doubt

223
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,120
and the absence of doubt

224
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
must be considered equally

225
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
in what we do

226
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
it's kind of

227
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
it's kind of like schrodinger's

228
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
interpretation

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
of descartes

230
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
you have doubt and you have no doubt in

231
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,160
the same situation at the same time

232
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
and you have to be a good arbiter of

233
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
what's there

234
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,440
you have to be a good arbiter of the

235
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
information and figure out exactly

236
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,480
what's going on because our biases our

237
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
perception of things

238
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
will confuse us

239
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
and it will hurt your mind

240
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
initial perceptions can

241
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
obscure

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
the mental vision

243
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
of any

244
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,599
innate principles that we hold

245
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,480
let's take a moment look at my

246
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,640
beautiful piece of abstract

247
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,519
expressionism

248
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
if i told you that all the green lines

249
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,720
are straight would you doubt me

250
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
could you doubt me

251
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,839
is it reasonable

252
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
would you have thought about

253
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
those lines being straight if i didn't

254
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
mention it or would have you just gone

255
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,120
along with what you saw

256
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,160
let's go one further

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
is the mind able to think

258
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,760
of something

259
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,560
that's not there

260
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
can the mind think of not something if i

261
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,200
tell you

262
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
i don't want you to think about an

263
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
elephant what's the first thing you're

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
going to think about

265
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
oh come on anybody

266
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
elephant thank you

267
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
one person thinks of an elephant

268
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,518
the experiment failed

269
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,959
so why do you think of an elephant when

270
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,000
i say please don't think of an elephant

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
because you can't stop yourself

272
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,519
how many different colored balls are up

273
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,760
there

274
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
three three three

275
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,439
how about one

276
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,599
one color ball

277
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,440
can you bring yourself to the point

278
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
where you can see the one color of the

279
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,279
ball

280
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
yeah it's hard isn't it

281
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,160
you're struggling to focus on the balls

282
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,399
and to verify the same color

283
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,519
and you're trying to in your head

284
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,760
keep those balls the same color as you

285
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
move around the picture

286
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
but your mind will draw away as you look

287
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
to one side to the other the balls will

288
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,638
change color again

289
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
and you are accepting the deception

290
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,880
you can't stop it

291
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,639
here it goes all right

292
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,160
in a deception

293
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
the key of what you want to do

294
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
is decided by the type of deception if i

295
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
have ambiguity increasing

296
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
that's designed for a general population

297
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
if i don't know what my network

298
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
defenders know

299
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
if i don't know their skill level if i

300
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,480
don't know their education

301
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
their situational awareness how good

302
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,120
their tools are

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
i'll use something like that

304
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
i'll increase ambiguity i'll make

305
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
multiple things happen

306
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
and they'll have to decide

307
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
waste resources spend time

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,839
figure out what's the right

309
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,680
answer misleading

310
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
is just the opposite

311
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
misleading is where you focus

312
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,680
to achieve your deception

313
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,440
you focus on the decision maker

314
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
i don't care about anybody else who's in

315
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
the chain

316
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,320
i have a bright shiny thing and i want

317
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
that decision maker to do something

318
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
what i'll do

319
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
is i will make sure that i have some

320
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
tests

321
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,720
and i'll do what's called conduit

322
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
validation

323
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,639
i'm going to make sure

324
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
that the message that i've packaged

325
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
gets

326
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,000
handed from one person to the next

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,560
and presented to the decision maker

328
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,240
the way i want it presented to that

329
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
person

330
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
and because i have one person i have

331
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
good information on that person

332
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,360
i'm not shooting it out to everybody but

333
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,160
i have that one person in mind

334
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
i'm gonna

335
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,160
have high confidence

336
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,839
that that person will react the way i

337
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
want them to

338
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,920
it's not a taking a chance

339
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,000
it's actually using

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
those balls

341
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,000
to show the picture that i want

342
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,880
to make the decision maker the person

343
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
who is the cso

344
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
the cso

345
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,800
the ceo

346
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
demand a policy change

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,079
gonna go right to the top

348
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,760
somebody who has influence to make a

349
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,040
decision

350
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,639
to impact what you're trying to do

351
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
if you ever have the discussion

352
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
with someone

353
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
about politics we're not going to get

354
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
into politics but if we're going to get

355
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,120
we're going to have a discussion

356
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
you have

357
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
one perspective

358
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,160
and you have a counter perspective did

359
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
you ever notice that in most discussions

360
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,079
or arguments

361
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,279
that there's only two sides to the coin

362
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,680
there's only one way to look at it or

363
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,959
the other

364
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,399
the pro

365
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,199
or the con

366
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
by limiting your ability to interpret

367
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,079
the data

368
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,240
you're only given two choices

369
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
you can only have one or the other

370
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
so you are either

371
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,639
100 correct in what you do or a hundred

372
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,279
percent incorrect

373
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,440
this is a control method

374
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,920
for managing doubt

375
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
and implementing a deception

376
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
i'm sure that you could probably

377
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
identify numerous

378
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,079
cases

379
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
where you've come across this in your

380
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,800
life and it could be something very

381
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
simple as implementing a control ins at

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
work

383
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,720
or when you get home with your spouse

384
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,639
how do you for example

385
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,519
hello honey i'm home let's go out to

386
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,759
dinner

387
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,839
okay let's go out to dinner not a

388
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,839
deception we'll go out to dinner okay

389
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,199
good and what's the first question you

390
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,479
ask your spouse

391
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,399
where do you want to go to dinner

392
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
well that puts a lot of pressure on one

393
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,079
person that's one side you're only going

394
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
to get one answer that way but if you

395
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
say

396
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
possibly

397
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
let's go to dinner

398
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,959
what don't you want for dinner

399
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,160
more people will have a list of places

400
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,799
that they don't want to go to

401
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,599
as opposed to being forced into one

402
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,199
small answer

403
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,559
that they think that you're going to

404
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
agree with

405
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
my wife likes

406
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,320
chinese food thai food i could go like

407
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
right down the list i know what she's

408
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
going to say yes to

409
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,039
but giving that option to someone

410
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,160
well

411
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
aren't you more generous to them aren't

412
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,240
isn't it nicer to ask them

413
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
what they prefer not to do

414
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
we can go to

415
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,880
mcdonald's

416
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
yes

417
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
no i don't want to go to mcdonald's

418
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
nobody wants to go to mcdonald's

419
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
oh okay well i have all these things

420
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
that i could do

421
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
you're guiding

422
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
the discussion

423
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
come on man

424
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,320
there we go

425
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
so in the lottery

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
lotteries have been around for many

427
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
years this is a good example of a

428
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,559
deception

429
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
lotteries are designed to take a whole

430
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,160
bunch of money

431
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,760
from a whole bunch of people that don't

432
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
have a lot of money

433
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
and push it to people who have a lot of

434
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
money who want more money

435
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,559
that's all lotteries do every single

436
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,360
time what happens when some poor person

437
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
on the street

438
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
wins

439
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
500 million euro in a lottery

440
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
how fast are they back on the street

441
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,840
how fast do people come in and take the

442
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,880
money from

443
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,520
i'm a financial advisor i i can help you

444
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
invest your money this way in that way

445
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,360
you'll be set for life and before you

446
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,639
know it all the money is gone

447
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
the question isn't

448
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
whether i can win the lottery or not win

449
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,919
the lottery the question should be

450
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,640
obvious is that

451
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,120
how do i play the lottery why do i play

452
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,640
the lottery

453
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
who makes money on the lottery those are

454
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
the questions you should be asked asking

455
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
yourself before you engage in the

456
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,120
lottery and the same thing

457
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,559
would happen

458
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,080
in numerous other venues

459
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,720
why am i engaged in the game

460
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,520
let me see if i can run the video

461
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,440
my timeline and understand what what

462
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
happened in that context but i also

463
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
think that we need to we need to take

464
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,480
very seriously that

465
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,360
our camera fell down

466
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,559
okay okay

467
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,120
so the camera fell down

468
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
what what did you just see

469
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,400
you see

470
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,520
here's a famous news anchor jake tappert

471
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
on a very

472
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
trusted news source

473
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,480
cnn showing you a reporter in front of a

474
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
seat of authority

475
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
at the american white house

476
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,600
and they're giving you very important

477
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,240
information

478
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,720
and somebody

479
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
kicked the camera

480
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,320
but also kick the screen

481
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
so going back to what descartes was

482
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,360
talking about about doubt

483
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,720
do you actually

484
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,679
trust them now that they deliberately

485
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,120
deceived you

486
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
for what they were doing

487
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,240
can you trust them anymore

488
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
can you trust any news source

489
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,640
should you

490
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,960
just a thought

491
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
timeline and oh there we go

492
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
it wasn't that long ago

493
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
and uh just so you see here uh i have a

494
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,760
asterisk

495
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
next to the director's name william

496
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
colby

497
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
that's because

498
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,360
he was

499
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,799
deceased by very strange situation

500
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,720
and you can go look that up on wikipedia

501
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
if you like but

502
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,559
william colby said something very

503
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
interesting in what was called the

504
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,799
church commission back in 1976

505
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,320
he said the press has been manipulated

506
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,360
by governments for years

507
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
and

508
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,640
it was

509
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
said that the cia had run a program

510
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,559
called operation mockingbird where they

511
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,120
put people into the press to manage

512
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
their presence in the press

513
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
they managed propaganda that was being

514
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,080
pushed out back during the cold war and

515
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,039
it was targeted at the soviet union

516
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,320
so who in the press was targeted

517
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,520
well it was

518
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
cbs

519
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,039

reuters

526
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,760
i could go on

527
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,000
but these guys

528
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,039
targeted

529
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,159
and used the media to spread

530
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,720
false information

531
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,799
how many other governments around there

532
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
have spread false information

533
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,320
through the media do we know

534
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
what level of doubt that you do you have

535
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,679
about what these guys are selling you

536
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,520
here's a good example

537
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
non-governmental

538
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,760
this guy right here i want to be like

539
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,080
him

540
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,080
he sold absolutely nothing

541
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,480
nothing

542
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,480
for 18 000 u.s dollars

543
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,120
and it's it's important though because

544
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,200
the nothing that he was selling

545
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,840
had to be displayed in a five by five

546
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,799
foot square in a private space

547
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,559
so you could experience

548
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
nothing

549
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,679
now i don't know how much time it takes

550
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,080
a sculptor or an artist to create

551
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,000
nothing

552
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,960
but i'm sure that he was paid very well

553
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,679
for what he didn't do

554
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
in 1980 control of the media in the

555
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,039
states

556
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,880
was managed by 50 different companies

557
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
by 2018

558
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,200
there was only five companies that

559
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,440
controlled information

560
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,159
in the states

561
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
and i'm ryan wolfe our greatest

562
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
responsibility is to serve our treasure

566
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
are extremely proud of the quality

567
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,279
balance journalism that cbs 4 news

568
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,480
produces

569
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,200
but we are concerned

570
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
the sharing of biased and false news has

571
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
become all too common on social media

572
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,960
more alarming some media outlets publish

573
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
these same fake stories without checking

574
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,159
facts first the sharing of biased false

575
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,159
news

576
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,559
unfortunately

577
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,679
this is extremely dangerous to our

578
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,240
democracy this is extremely dangerous to

579
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,000
our democracy this is extremely

580
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,760
dangerous to our democracy this is

581
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,919
extremely dangerous to our democracy

582
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,840
this is extremely dangerous to our

583
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,080
democracy this is extremely dangerous to

584
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,480
our democracy this is extremely

585
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,559
dangerous to our democracy this is

586
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
extremely dangerous to our democracy

587
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,799
this is extremely dangerous to our

588
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,679
democracy this is extremely dangerous to

589
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,120
our democracy

590
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
this is extremely dangerous to our

591
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
democracy this is extremely dangerous to

592
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
our democracy

593
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
this is extremely dangerous to our

594
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
democracy this is extremely dangerous to

595
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,080
our democracy this is extremely

596
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,520
dangerous to our democracy

597
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,120
so the message is

598
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
this is extremely dangerous yeah you got

599
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,279
it very good

600
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,039
all right

601
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,200
so there was a 107 news channels

602
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
107

603
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
and they all played exactly the same

604
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,159
script

605
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
not saying it was deceptive i'm just

606
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,600
saying it was

607
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
awkward

608
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,840
so here's another former cia

609
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,559
director william casey

610
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,159
in the first cabinet meeting that he had

611
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,159
with then president ronald reagan he

612
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
said well no our disinformation program

613
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,159
is complete when everything the american

614
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
public believes is false

615
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
this is our director of intelligence

616
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
over in the states how comfortable do

617
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,559
you think we should feel about that

618
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
it's kind of a little

619
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,880
concerning as far as i can i can say

620
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
so remember i mentioned abstract

621
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
expressionism before

622
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,960
uh in 1950

623
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
uh

624
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
in the states they we also created what

625
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
was called the congress for cultural

626
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,919
freedom

627
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,919
and they promoted different abstract

628
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,600
expressionists and other cultural events

629
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,640
you can see

630
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
uh jackson pollock in the center there

631
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
abstract expressionism rose out of

632
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,840
nowhere in the 40s to significant

633
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
prominence and all jackson pollock did

634
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,159
was drip paint on a canvas

635
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,520
and just like the previous picture i

636
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
showed you what was the message there

637
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
what was the deception there

638
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,320
what's happening here he made that

639
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
multi-million dollar piece of art up at

640
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,559
the top there

641
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
i'm not sure uh

642
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,440
i would have paid that much for it but

643
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,760
so it goes

644
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,279
last video clip for you just to kind of

645
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,000
get an idea

646
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,918
people will believe what they're told

647
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,039
anybody believe that

648
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,960
ah see yes very good

649
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,720
a decade earlier psychologist stanley

650
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,399
milgram had also looked at how we

651
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,360
respond to authority

652
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
in order to understand how people were

653
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,240
induced to obey unjust regimes and

654
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,159
participate in atrocities such as the

655
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,440
holocaust he set up an experiment

656
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,960
volunteers were told they were taking

657
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,600
part in scientific research to improve

658
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,799

659
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,480

660
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200

separated by a screen

662
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,600
the teacher would ask the learner

663
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,360
questions in a word game

664
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,120
and administer an electric shock when

665
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,880
the answer was incorrect

666
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,960

by what they perceived as a legitimate

691
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,679
authority figure in this case a man in a

692
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,520
white coat 375 volts

693
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,919
i think something's happened

694
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,760
i don't get no answer he was hollering

695
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
with less voltage can't you check in and

696
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
see if he's alright please

697
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,399
milgram's findings horrified america

698
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,000
they showed that decent american

699
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
citizens were as capable of committing

700
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,679
acts against their conscience as the

701
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,720
germans had been under the nazis

702
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,480
so

703
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,000
does this tell you something about

704
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,559
today yesterday

705
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,880
this

706
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,720
experiment has been repeated over and

707
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,840
over again

708
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,679
and people in different countries and

709
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
different cultures they react the same

710
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,480
way

711
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,640
if they believe someone has legitimate

712
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,360
authority they will do

713
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
whatever is asked of them in most cases

714
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,159
in some cases there's too much to lose

715
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,720
you have too much invested

716
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,440
you can't afford to take that risk

717
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
on the other hand

718
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
some people will play right along with

719
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,480
the deception

720
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,240
and not question it ever

721
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,919
so in order to not get yelled at by win

722
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,360
we're going to jump forward a little bit

723
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,120
more

724
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,600
because we only have certain time left

725
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,080
this is a

726
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,600
a great opportunity to discuss

727
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,039
asymmetric dominance

728
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,080
it's a technique that's used on people

729
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,360
basically

730
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
think about what you're focusing on

731
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,880
right now

732
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,600
[Music]

733
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,800
now what are you focusing on

734
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,440
[Music]

735
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,919
i'm controlling where you're going

736
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,060
maybe not everybody

737
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,039
[Music]

738
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,200
but most people

739
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,480
a lot of you are going to watch this

740
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,519
young kid

741
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,880
solve you

742
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,200
three juggling rubik's cubes

743
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,720
in less than three and a half minutes

744
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,360
but we're not going to do that

745
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,039
asymmetric dominance is extremely

746
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,640
important in increasing doubt

747
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,720
but in more so

748
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,600
removing doubt it's giving you that

749
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,279
full

750
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,399
of deception in that your confidence is

751
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,760
going to drop and you're going your

752
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
confidence is going to increase excuse

753
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,760
me and you're going to be very confident

754
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,840
about what you're doing

755
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
it's not ambiguity increasing it's

756
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,840
misleading

757
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,320
asymmetric dominance means basically you

758
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,440
have

759
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
two three

760
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
four choices

761
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
but i'm going to draw you to the one

762
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,399
that i want you to focus on

763
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,480
and you are going to go right along

764
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,519
because

765
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
you're not going to assume that

766
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,360
anything's happening

767
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,519
your doubt level is extremely low

768
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,679
beliefs

769
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,720
there is some new research in the last

770
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,840
10 years

771
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,919
that show how our beliefs can actually

772
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,519
be impacted

773
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
by neurotransmitter activities

774
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,960
our neurological system actually helps

775
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,320
to reinforce

776
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,439
what our beliefs are

777
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,720
and for the sake of time we'll we can

778
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
discuss that if you'd like to talk about

779
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,080
it on the boat tonight we can talk about

780
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,320
that

781
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,399
let me go here

782
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,960
so mitigation for deception

783
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
basically the bottom line is

784
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,840
awareness always be aware acknowledge

785
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,440
that you have doubt for something don't

786
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,120
be afraid of it

787
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
engage your doubt

788
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,600
and what i mean by that is

789
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,519
be comfortable in the fact that you're

790
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,039
doubtful

791
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,480
be comfortable in the fact that you're

792
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,119
not doubtful

793
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,359
there's a reason why you have doubt

794
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,960
there's a reason why you don't have

795
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,280
doubt

796
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,520
the most important aspect is is to be

797
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,359
confident in your skills and your

798
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,000
capabilities

799
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
you've seen

800
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,839
the several examples that i showed you

801
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,639
of deceptive activity

802
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,639
some is intentional some is not

803
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,760
intentional

804
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,679
some by government some by private

805
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
organizations

806
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,639
it's all around you

807
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,399
the key for you is to ensure

808
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,760
that you

809
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,040
can doubt

810
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
and be comfortable

811
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,960
in a contested information environment

812
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,480
what we want you to understand is that

813
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,719
it's not going to get any easier

814
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,440
you're going to get more information

815
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,440
information overload is not going away

816
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,680
information overload is has been around

817
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,319
for 200 250 years we've talked about it

818
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,800
so you're going to have to

819
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,480
be able to maneuver within the noise

820
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,200
does your adversary talk about sun tzu

821
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,079
and then enact clausewitz

822
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,400
or talk about clausewitz and enact sun

823
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
tzu

824
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,760
be aware of who the adversary is don't

825
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,400
be afraid

826
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
to question their motives or identify

827
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
what their motives are and then

828
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,520
put countermeasures in place before they

829
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,920
get to you

830
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,680
check the calibration

831
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,720
of

832
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,078
your calibration equipment

833
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,359
if you use something to calibrate

834
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,759
possibly

835
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,960
the calibration point is moving a little

836
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,280
bit like one tenth of one degree over

837
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,160
time

838
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,760
it won't move enough out of the standard

839
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,480
deviation for you to notice it about six

840
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,079
months from now eight months from now

841
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
something like that

842
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,400
the point of calibration will have moved

843
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,920
and it won't be

844
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,839
in what you need in your technical specs

845
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,359
for it to be accurate anymore

846
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,599
be aware of what you use to calibrate

847
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,280
because that's just as important as what

848
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,839
you're calibrating

849
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
and always question

850
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,079
if you see an artifact

851
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,640
a deception creates two artifacts

852
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
one is the true one is the deception

853
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,839
story

854
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,400
both artifacts are existing at the same

855
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
time

856
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,079
you have to use what's called the

857
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,839
abductive process

858
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,920
as a part of the as opposed to a

859
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,839
deductive process

860
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,160
objective you work from the back forward

861
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,920
right you've seen what's happened and

862
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,760
you have to go and figure out what's

863
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,280
happened

864
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,160
that's the sherlock holmes method

865
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
that's the only successful way to root

866
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,319
out deceptions

867
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,079
so

868
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,480
uh abductively is a way to

869
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,839
be able to solve deception

870
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,440
problems be comfortable

871
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,040
be comfortable in who you are what

872
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
you're doing trust

873
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,599
yourself

874
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,160
trust you get a log file you get pcap

875
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
that information is pretty solid

876
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,560
trust the information that you have like

877
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,440
that

878
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,000
if you see incongruities you have to

879
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,720
objectively solve those problems

880
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,880
in order to

881
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,680
figure out what deception is happening

882
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,320
identify who the key person is that

883
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
somebody who is a deceiver

884
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,440
wants to manipulate who they want to

885
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
raise doubt in that person they want

886
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
them to

887
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,079
be off balance

888
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,680
and you have to be able to communicate

889
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
that to that decision maker so that

890
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,320
they're not confused about what's

891
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,480
happening so they understand

892
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
what's going on so they're not drawn

893
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,680
into the deception

894
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,760
and i'll leave you with the thought

895
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
because

896
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,200
it's important again i have to say it

897
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,280
again

898
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,040
be comfortable

899
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,480
with

900
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,599
the noise be comfortable with the doubt

901
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
that you're going to have be comfortable

902
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,960
with being uncomfortable

903
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,880
that's how you beat deception with

904
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,839
counter deception

905
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,880
the deceiver wants you to be off balance

906
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
they want you to be off balance so you

907
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,520
have a reaction and you react that same

908
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,040
way every single time

909
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,200
if you move and you shift that paradigm

910
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,960
they're looking for something to happen

911
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,599
and you don't give it to them

912
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,359
you've won that round and you're better

913
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,520
positioned to deal with them going

914
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,640
forward into the future

915
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,040
and with that

916
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,079
when i have four minutes

917
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,280

918
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,640
no is anybody still alive

919
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,480

922
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,719
[Applause]
