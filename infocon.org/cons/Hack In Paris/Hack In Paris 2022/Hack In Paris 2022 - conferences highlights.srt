1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
your organization or your personal life

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,520
does not use

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,400
some form of good cybersecurity

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,400
practices

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
at one point

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
you will be targeted

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,279
and you will become a victim of cyber

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,320
crime

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
and it's not why cyber security is

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
important it's what happens

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,570
if you don't take it seriously

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,730

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,960
what i love about hacking paris is that

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
there's like lots of geeks

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,680
and geeks is definitely my environment

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,359
so there's lots of people with huge

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
experience from the field

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,760
and it's a fantastic opportunity to

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,159
share experiences and that is what is i

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
think the most important factor in order

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,080
to be better in cyber security

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:41,269
[Music]

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
what i like about this event is

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
professionalism a lot of information on

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,399
first of all hacking how to get

27
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
into real data

28
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,520
i think people need to have an

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
approachability to different problems

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
they have a curiosity and a kind of a

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
flexibility as well i think it's easy to

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
get too siloed in cyber security oh i do

33
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
this and i do that the biggest problem

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,040
with computer security today is that

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
we think with a computer security model

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,560
that's 40 to 50 years old

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,040
there's no new innovations there are no

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
new ideas in the last

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
several decades

40
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,519
this conference is bringing forward some

41
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,760
of those new ideas today

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
and i believe that these will be the new

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
areas researched going forward

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
