1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
have come a long way with new approaches

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,839
and new ways of thinking

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,759
and what we've been hearing this morning

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,559
is

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,880
different approaches different ways of

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
looking at security

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
and one of the things that has

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,600
been a problem forever is the management

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,720
would say

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,080
looking for a management porn excuse or

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
pretty picture

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,519
they say are we secure

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
can we answer that question

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
and we really cannot answer that

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
question ever by saying yes it does

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
not exist security

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,040
as a perfect answer doesn't exist

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
so i wanted to look at

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
and i've some work i've been doing for

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
many years now

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,280
is looking at how to

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,079
design security systems

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
with measurement

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
in mind um i've been using a lot of

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,440
these uh ideas and axioms as to how to

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,159
think about security whether security is

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,840
at network level

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
whether security is at the physical

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
level

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,720
whether

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
security is at the human level because

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,880
we have to make these all

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,320
work together and so over many years of

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,439
looking at the world through an analog

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
lens instead of a digital lens i've come

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
up with a lot of different ideas

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,880
we know what we're doing isn't working

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,200
we know that the fundamental model that

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
we are using

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
for most network security is based upon

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,039
the work of anderson from 1972

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
and one of the premises that i use

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
is that digital is not binary we want to

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,600
think

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,399
and our managers want us to think

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
either or either we are secure we're not

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,079
secure and i have ended up over the

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,520
years thinking much more like an ics

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
person industrial control system because

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,560
they have a lot more right than we do

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,360
and we are stuck

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
one of the problems that we have is the

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
concept of infinity

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
if we expect security to ever be perfect

55
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
we are going to have to reach

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
infinity which is obviously going to be

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
impossible to do

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
and when we look at ics systems and

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
other analog control systems

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,519
there is no infinity there are limits

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
and joe was talking a moment ago about

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,319
min

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,840
and max minimum and maximum conditions

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
and when we look at security if we start

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
thinking that way we're going to end up

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,720
with some different answers

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
and this remote is

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
brilliant

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
so i'm thinking if you're clicking for

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,480
me thank you

71
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
uh what we need to do is get rid of

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
zeros and ones when we think of ics

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
systems and i'll get into some of that

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
in a little more detail

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
there are no zeros there are no ones

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
there are continuously variable

77
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
functions

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,440
that are

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,400
measurable and one of the biggest things

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
that they use that we do not use very

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,560
often

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,959
is the concept of feedback in the

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,319
systems

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
every engineering project in the world

85
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,720
with the exception of computer science

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
and i.t security

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
uses feedback

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
in order to control the process

89
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
in order to keep it for the system from

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
trying to reach infinity

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
or ever being able to reach zero or

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
completely non-functional

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
and

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
part of the concept that we're going to

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
have to deal with

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
is the concept of negative time

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
everybody wants things to go faster all

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
the processes have to go faster faster

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
faster

100
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
and we know

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,560
that the faster things go the more room

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
there is for error because there's not

103
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,759
enough time left

104
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,720
to be able to make corrections or

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
adaptations unless your feedback system

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
is based upon

107
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,759
a loop and we'll get into the loops

108
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,600
time ends up being the single metric

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,639
that works with risk works with privacy

110
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,320
works with data exfiltration can work

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
with cost analysis and roi

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,040
based upon rates of data exfiltration

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,560
time is the single metric that we rarely

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
ever see in any of the formulas

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
and the approaches we take to security

116
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,400
so

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
that's not too bad the way that did that

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
the concept uh began believe it or not

119
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,080
in a bar in warsaw in 1996

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,720
and it was based upon some work done by

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,520
disa part of the united states

122
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
department of defense

123
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,120
and the concept is very very simple

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
how

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
strong

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,160
is your security protective device

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,919
how strong is it with a number

128
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,479
will a vendor guarantee performance

129
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
of that particular protective device

130
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,199
we guarantee our firewall

131
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,680
nobody will ever be able to break into

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,479
it

133
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
for seven days

134
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
does any vendor say that

135
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
or is it

136
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,039
one millisecond or is it three years

137
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,720
we tend not to think in terms of time

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
but now let's go to the physical world

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,960
if i am a bad guy and i'm gonna break

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
into a jewelry store

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
well i've got to break in somehow so

142
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,479
let's say

143
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
i'm going to throw a rock through the

144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,960
window

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,600
and we'll also say that this jewelry

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
store

147
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
is very security conscious

148
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,919
so they have a detection system

149
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,720
their detection system now knows the

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
window is broken

151
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,599
how long did it take

152
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,560
that

153
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,919
detection system in the window to know

154
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,720
that it was broken by my rock a guess

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
how long

156
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,440
hmm a minute

157
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,840
oh you got a shitty jewelry store

158
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,280
it should be

159
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
a few milliseconds

160
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
if there's a wire tape around it it

161
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,520
should know instantly well not instantly

162
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,599
but very very quickly

163
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,560
something

164
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
is broken through the window

165
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
and i'm the bad guy and i know that that

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,479
is very very fast

167
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
what happens next in the case of a

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
physical robbery the detection system

169
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,679
should

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,319
call the police right call the armed

171
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,120
guards call somebody

172
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
for a

173
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,800
response now the bad guys that are smart

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,199
know how far the police station is away

175
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
how long it takes to dial the phone or

176
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
connect to them

177
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,039
how long it takes the police to respond

178
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,759
they know this

179
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
they know this in our

180
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,039
cyber attack world today

181
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
so when i add up two numbers

182
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
detection time

183
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,440
the rock going through the window

184
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
and

185
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
the response time of how long it takes

186
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,280
the police somebody to come back i end

187
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
up with a number called

188
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,960
exposure time e.t

189
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,759
so

190
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,159
what do the bad guys do

191
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,719
they have a watch and they say

192
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,440
it'll we have three minutes

193
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
to steal as much as we can before we

194
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
have to get get out because that's when

195
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
the cops come

196
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,640
and in all the movies we see

197
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
there's always somebody counting down we

198
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
have two minutes left we have one minute

199
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
left 10 seconds left let's get out of

200
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
here

201
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
the bad guys are still doing this

202
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
not only in the physical world but

203
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
they're also doing it in the network

204
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
world so therefore

205
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,080
how do i defend

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
well my vendor

207
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,480
should be able to say we guarantee

208
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,360
that our protective device

209
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
will be greater

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
in the amount of time it offers

211
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,680
protection

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
then the amount of time of detection

213
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
and reaction

214
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,839
pretty straight ahead pretty simple the

215
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
concept but it's very different than the

216
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,279
way management thinks and most i.t

217
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
professionals and security professionals

218
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
think

219
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
because it's no longer dealing with

220
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
zeros and ones

221
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
and when we start looking at network

222
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
exfiltration

223
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
bandwidth

224
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
suddenly becomes

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
another time component

226
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,080
to be able to measure how much in this

227
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,519
case data exfiltration can occur

228
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,000
over what period of time

229
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
how many of you have any of this data

230
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
for your existing networks

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
i'm going to show you the schematics on

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,720
how to figure it out

233
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,680
i was talking earlier feedback systems

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,640
the upper right electrical systems if

235
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
there is no feedback what happens the

236
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
microphone squeals

237
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
if i have no feedback the amplifier

238
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,560
tries to reach infinity

239
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,640
that mechanical device there keeps

240
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
trains

241
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
steam engines from going too fast so

242
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,720
there is a limit function

243
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,040
and that's where the expression balls to

244
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
the walls comes from is when the balls

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
on that device called the governor

246
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
hit the wall of the casing

247
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,880
that has created the maximum speed

248
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
condition in that particular environment

249
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
all engineering has this now in scada

250
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
systems and i'm going to go back to that

251
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,399
and good ics systems

252
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,800
time is an integral integral component

253
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
of how to calculate a system's

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
performance

255
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,560
so

256
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
uh

257
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
one of the great examples is in the

258
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
netherlands with a thing called the

259
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
delta works after the 1953 floods

260
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
they decided we are going to protect the

261
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
entire country

262
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,320
with a system of dikes

263
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,200
and water controls and how do they do it

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
they do it with lots and lots of

265
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,000
detectors of temperature of waves of

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
wind of heights of water depths of water

267
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,519
turbulence of the water the heights of

268
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,480
the controls and the physical walls

269
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
and none of them ever reach zero none of

270
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,600
them ever reach infinity

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
they're all within a set of conditions

272
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
that are designed by the security system

273
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,360
of that particular environment

274
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
and this is the way that ics systems do

275
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
a really really good job

276
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
of creating min max conditions that are

277
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
permissible within my environment

278
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
instead of saying

279
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
i want my processors to go faster i want

280
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,800
faster communication i want everything

281
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,000
faster and keep security out of my face

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
which is the approach that unfortunately

283
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,959
we've been taking these days

284
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,200
we use this in our daily lives has

285
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,639
anybody ever used a toilet

286
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,839
sometimes

287
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
where do you work sir

288
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
a toilet has a ball

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
no water fills the water reaches a max

290
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
condition

291
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,360
so the water will not overflow and it

292
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,959
has been picked when it's working

293
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,320
correctly an optimal condition that is

294
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
safe

295
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,760
super simple temperature controls

296
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
heating and air conditioning

297
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
it never goes to -273

298
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
and it never goes to well we hope it

299
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,959
doesn't unless you're into

300
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,320
physics

301
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,959
and it's never going to reach hopefully

302
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,639
100 c

303
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,839
it'll be somewhere in between and a

304
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,920
detection system a reaction system

305
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,040
set the minimum and maximum conditions

306
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
that are permissible for that

307
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
environment

308
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
and then of course self-driving cars

309
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
same sort of condition in theory

310
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
we're not there yet and i don't know if

311
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,839
we're going to be there for quite a

312
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,120
while

313
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
are supposed to be able

314
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
in theory to be able to detect the

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
minimum maximum safe

316
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,120
operating conditions of a vehicle on the

317
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,519
street that's future and that's hope

318
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
when we look at neural networks

319
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,079
neural networks do not have a zero or a

320
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,760
one

321
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
they have something all of their numbers

322
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,880
are a little bit greater

323
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,920
than zero or a little bit less than one

324
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,720
somewhere in between

325
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
minimum and maximum operating conditions

326
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
and that is where you hear the term bias

327
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
data bias processing bias weighting bias

328
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,320
in ai they're looking at the problem in

329
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
the correct way it's a very very

330
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,760
difficult problem to solve about how to

331
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
adjust bias

332
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,279
and the reason is we do not know yet

333
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,399
what is a safe operating

334
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,839
range

335
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,880
we can guess but we'll also disagree a

336
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,760
lot

337
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,120
and one of the things that's very

338
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,199
interesting about the feedback networks

339
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,440
in neural networks

340
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
is when you ask a neural network a

341
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,680
question

342
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
and you get an answer

343
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
then you ask the neural network the same

344
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
question again

345
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
you very may well get a different answer

346
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
because the mere fact that you're asking

347
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
a question

348
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,079
of the neural network has changed the

349
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,480
weighting and bias factor of it itself

350
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,199
so again all of this is not digital

351
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,639
it is an analog function operating

352
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
between zero and between one where is

353
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,720
our security feedback

354
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,959
where do we have it

355
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,880
where do we have the operational

356
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
controls to be able to detect

357
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
before a system starts having a runaway

358
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,959
condition

359
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
we have runaway acoustics we have

360
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
runaway electronics we have runaway

361
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
mechanical systems

362
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,720
in our world that's when we say

363
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,160
network collision and what is our answer

364
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
what is our answer turn it off

365
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,519
turn it back on again

366
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,279
that is the answer that we've come up

367
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,279
with in the last 45 years

368
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,440
one of the approaches that i really like

369
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,279
was invented by

370
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,519
a colonel in the united states air force

371
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
in 1984

372
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,440
and he wanted to know in an aerial dog

373
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
fight with

374
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,839
fast fighter

375
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,000
planes who is going to win a battle

376
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
who is going to win a battle

377
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
what's the answer

378
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
anybody shout it out

379
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,399
the pilot

380
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,079
i don't know is a really good one

381
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,480
because the answer was not obvious until

382
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,359
colonel boyd's work

383
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,559
he created this loop ooda

384
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,199
observe

385
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,760
the environment around me

386
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,839
i'm up in an airplane

387
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,839
what does it look like

388
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,640
orient yourself towards

389
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
the other objects and things in that

390
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
combat environment

391
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,240
make a decision of how you are going to

392
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
do something in order to survive because

393
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
that is your goal as the pilot is to

394
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,640
survive

395
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,360
and then act on it and then do it all

396
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,840
over again

397
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,640
the answer who survives a dog fight is

398
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
who has the fastest

399
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,039
ooda loop

400
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,160
who can do this the fastest

401
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,440
it's a matter of time

402
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,720
only a matter of time and again we are

403
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,919
not taking this approach currently

404
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,600
with our general information security

405
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
i.t security

406
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,480
physical security approaches because we

407
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
still live with this

408
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,399
binary condition in our minds

409
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,679
don't you love remotes

410
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
that is just a more complex way of ooda

411
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,039
because uda can become very complex

412
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,880
depending upon

413
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,160
how many sensors and sensors becomes a

414
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
key component with this new way of

415
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,880
thinking about security

416
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
what do we do

417
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
well we have uda

418
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
also that'll work with

419
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,679
and there's two kinds of feedback

420
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
one kind of feedback is negative

421
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
feedback

422
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
negative feedback helps control

423
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,280
and constrict and define the operating

424
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,919
parameters of a system

425
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
very simple

426
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,160
works all around the world that's why we

427
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
have water that's why we have

428
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,200
electricity every night

429
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,160
between 11 50 pm and 12 10 a.m

430
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
the frequency

431
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,559
of the power line here in europe 50

432
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,679
cycles in the united states 60 cycles

433
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,960
if you measure it you'll see it changing

434
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
because they have to by law

435
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,559
have one stable frequency

436
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,320
average per day

437
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,039
so they have an adjustment period

438
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,440
in between this that's all part of their

439
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,520
loop with education we have positive

440
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,720
feedback

441
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
i want to teach you something and so we

442
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,840
create positive feedback loops and

443
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,200
you're going to be hearing from dr

444
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
carpenter later about what positive

445
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
feedback

446
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
why it is good in some places

447
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,960
psychologically why it isn't bad in some

448
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,520
places psychologically and in the world

449
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
i come from

450
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,919
positive feedback will destroy a system

451
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,480
but they both have ooda functions that

452
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
have to be defined in order to create a

453
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,799
safe

454
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
operating environment

455
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,919
so let's

456
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,559
put some pieces together here

457
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
um

458
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
remote banking so i've got my phone and

459
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
i wanted venmo i want to do something

460
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,199
so i initiate a process

461
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
more and more in the last several years

462
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
some banks are taking advantage of some

463
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,280
of this concept and they say we're going

464
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,919
to send you an out of band code

465
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,679
to verify two-factor authentication

466
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,159
based upon time you have

467
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,039
five minutes you have 10 minutes you

468
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,320
have some

469
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
defined limit

470
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
operating safe parameters based upon the

471
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,679
risk

472
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
that the bank is willing to take as to

473
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
how long

474
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,120
you should take to enter that code

475
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
so what happens you initiate this

476
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,120
process the process stops

477
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,559
there's a clock

478
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,720
and that clock is driven by policy

479
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
and it says here's how long we're going

480
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,440
to let wynn wait before he enters in the

481
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
six or eight digit code

482
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
if

483
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,799
i do it correctly

484
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,520
the process continues and i can

485
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,919
make my banking transaction

486
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,000
if i do it wrong

487
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,280
based upon policy two times three times

488
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,240
i'm locked out and i must start it all

489
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
over again

490
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,360
so again there is no zero there is no

491
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
one everything is defined as a function

492
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,760
of time

493
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,240
and the safe operating limits of the

494
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,039
system are defined

495
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
by policy

496
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
and how you are evaluating the risk

497
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,320
of your operating environment

498
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
so here's my wife's car

499
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,919
she has one of those cars that uh will

500
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
sort of tell you uh there's a porsche

501
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
coming down your ass back here or there

502
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,600
there's uh don't turn here because

503
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,039
there's a bicycle and these are

504
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,720
a little bit intelligent we'll say

505
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
now let's say you have one of these cars

506
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,880
and you're driving along and you put on

507
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,919
i'm gonna shift lane

508
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,799
do you trust it how many people trust it

509
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,760
and will make that change

510
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,240
you guys are skeptical security people

511
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,679
how many people

512
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,799
will click it wait and then turn their

513
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,480
head and verify it

514
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,000
because we don't exclusively trust the

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
technology

516
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
we want to have

517
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
a verification because maybe there's a

518
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,640
porsche coming up at 160 miles an hour

519
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
on the audubon

520
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,600
and it's just a little too far away from

521
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
the sensors of my car to be able to

522
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,799
detect it

523
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,600
so i keep telling my wife

524
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,799
please do not just trust the car

525
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,520
let's go back to when we were kids and

526
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,960
look this way look that way and add that

527
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
double layer of verification because

528
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,880
what is the metric there time

529
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
time how far is that porsche away from

530
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,039
me

531
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
we are really good at calculating how to

532
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,919
hit a ball or kick a sock we can do that

533
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,120
our brain averages this stuff amazingly

534
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,679
well better than technology still

535
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,840
but too many people are starting to rely

536
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,799
exclusively oh if i click if i want to

537
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,679
change lanes the car says it's safe

538
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,240
and i think that is very very dangerous

539
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
to make that assumption without having a

540
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
time

541
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,840
based

542
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
feedback loop during which you can make

543
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,240
an intelligent decision

544
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,760
and intelligent remotes

545
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,720
and this comes down to the concept of

546
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,200
trust

547
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,039
who thinks there is such a thing as 100

548
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,158
percent trust

549
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,679
so none of you trust your wives with

550
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,240
your life

551
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,559
that is correct are you married sir

552
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,679
why does he keep talking

553
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,520
there is no such thing as absolute trust

554
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,960
because we the conditions the context of

555
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
the environment

556
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,919
is always changing so let's say

557
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,840
i'm going to hire i'm in hr i'm going to

558
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,440
hire somebody

559
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,400
and i have to decide

560
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
what do i care about

561
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
is he technically good

562
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,600
sure

563
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,720
uh has he been a criminal

564
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,799
well what kind of criminal

565
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,120
did he smoke some weed

566
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
did he kill people there's a difference

567
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,360
and part of the process is building a

568
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,080
weighted as in a neural network a

569
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,279
weighted first guess

570
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,640
set of minimum and maximum conditions

571
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,880
of where i want to establish

572
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
the amount of trust

573
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
that i have in this case in an

574
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,520
individual the same thing occurs

575
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,919
or should occur

576
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,559
when i have my network

577
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
my business

578
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,640
connected to dr carpenter's

579
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
do i trust dr carpenter's

580
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
network to connect to mine through an

581
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,400
api and do i have trust in it

582
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,320
well that's only because it's you greg

583
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,720
i may have trust today

584
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,919
should i have trust tomorrow as well

585
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,840
should i have trust in a week from now

586
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,039
is it a single binary decision or is it

587
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,919
something that i should

588
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,640
periodically

589
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,840
sense

590
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,120
detect

591
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
and re-evaluate

592
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,400
with a feedback loop

593
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,760
we're not doing any of this in any of

594
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
our security processes

595
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,760
everything is changing all of the time

596
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
how many changes occur to your network

597
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
on a daily basis any answer give me an

598
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
answer

599
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,440
all right i'll give you an answer maybe

600
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
a billion

601
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,760
maybe a trillion

602
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,279
maybe more

603
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,480
because every time a bit moves from one

604
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
place to another

605
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,400
the condition of your network has

606
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,799
changed

607
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,279
which ones are important

608
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,840
that's for you to decide

609
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,960
which ones should be more periodically

610
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,399
reviewed

611
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,080
and evaluated

612
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,520
before trusting that api connection you

613
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
have with another bank in another

614
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,559
country

615
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,880
how long should your trust exist

616
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,320
so

617
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,440
let's take a look at this from

618
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,399
administration

619
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,919
right now

620
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
in a mission critical position

621
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,559
in a typical server environment control

622
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,480
rooms socks knocks wherever

623
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,720
it takes a minimum of five human beings

624
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,520
to be able to have 24 7

625
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
coverage

626
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,440
five people roughly

627
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,320
now

628
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
in entirely too many of them they're

629
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,880
sharing the same password they're

630
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,360
sharing the same identity because that

631
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,919
single identity

632
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,399
is enough to be able to do that we don't

633
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,799
want to make things difficult do we

634
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,120
we don't want to make it hard for the

635
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,479
for the administrators so

636
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,440
what happens if we take another approach

637
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,799
let's say that my process is now and

638
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,559
maybe you've had some of this in europe

639
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,559
we used to have it in the u.s many years

640
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,000
ago

641
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,559
that before i can write a check

642
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,360
that the bank will cash

643
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,000
i have to have a second signature called

644
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
the two-man rule or i don't trust my

645
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,080
wife to write one

646
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
two-man rule in some places the two-man

647
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,799
rule

648
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,080
is like

649
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,559
two-factor authentication

650
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,200
i want to have another level of

651
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,960
verification

652
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
but in this case

653
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,960
with administration especially for

654
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
mission critical systems

655
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
let's say

656
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,399
alice

657
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,600
makes

658
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
an administrative decision

659
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,320
presses some buttons

660
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
and an action is taken

661
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
now typically that's just

662
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,120
alice making a decision

663
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,039
no oversight no feedback no min max

664
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,880
control

665
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
but what if we set a policy

666
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
that says

667
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
after alice makes a decision bob has to

668
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,279
approve it

669
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,960
well if we do it linearly

670
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,200
we have to wait for bob to come back

671
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,559
from lunch

672
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,520
maybe bob is on vacation again it's a

673
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,360
matter of time between the period

674
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,799
when alice makes a change and bob has to

675
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,600
make

676
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
a verification and approve it

677
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,720
but what if we set a policy limit and we

678
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,760
say

679
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,480
before ale before

680
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,880
the system will accept the change

681
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,840
permanently bob has to approve it

682
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,399
but bob has to approve it within

683
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,200
three minutes five minutes ten minutes

684
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
whatever policy says this could be

685
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,559
perhaps alice and bob or pieces of code

686
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,200
that have to approve each other within

687
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
some number of clock cycles or

688
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,559
milliseconds

689
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,360
the principle is exactly the same

690
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,240
taking an action that's mission critical

691
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,000
and requiring a time-based feedback

692
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
mechanism

693
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
to be able to validate it until the next

694
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,760
step is taken and this circuit is called

695
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,960
a time

696
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,320
based flip-flop flip-flops are ancient

697
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,640
electronic equipment from the 1920s

698
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,200
that we don't use much anymore

699
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,840
because they're binary functions and i'm

700
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,159
talking about an analog world

701
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,880
so we have to create

702
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,200
an analog version of that with an

703
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
appropriate

704
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,600
truth table that goes with it and the

705
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,760
truth table in this case invokes time

706
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,360
i'm not going to bore you the hell out

707
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,559
of this stuff but

708
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,880
let's look at how things talk to each

709
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
other

710
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
networks when we talk about trust we

711
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
know there's no such thing as 100

712
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,320
trust

713
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,720
but when i start connecting systems

714
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,200
together

715
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,240
something very interesting happens

716
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,919
and i have the sorry these slides are in

717
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,320
the wrong order

718
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,919
the way to calculate

719
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,360
what happens when more than one object

720
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
and at least three objects start to talk

721
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,200
to each other

722
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,840
we use

723
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,640
the remote

724
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,720
we use bays bayesian probability

725
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,039
when we look at systems under a bayesian

726
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,960
probability

727
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,360
methodology and some simple mathematics

728
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,080
it's very simple stuff

729
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
when we start connecting systems

730
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,080
together the trust goes way down

731
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,679
very very quickly

732
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,320
and in order to maintain high levels of

733
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,159
trust when you've got

734
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
multiple systems talking to each other

735
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,120
you your initial conditions for each one

736
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,080
of those individual systems must be very

737
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,679
very high

738
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,080
with its own internal weighting system

739
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,039
and its own probabilistic weights to be

740
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,679
able to determine how the system as a

741
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
whole is actually going to work

742
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,799
if you want some of the heavy math on

743
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,840
this i'm going to refer to dr carney

744
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
down here he will be here for the

745
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,919
conference who will help you get through

746
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,720
this

747
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,360
one of the problems that we have is the

748
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,440
concept and this goes back to the 1940s

749
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
it's called a rock curve

750
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,559
and it's

751
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,600
how accurate is stuff how accurate is it

752
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
when when you've got bombs and missiles

753
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
running around you care a whole lot

754
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,840
how accurate things are

755
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,240
so in our world we want what we desire

756
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,360
is to be 100 percent true positive

757
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,279
that's our goal

758
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,360
and in the rock curve that's all the way

759
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,960
in the upper left but it's never going

760
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,440
to happen never going to be achievable

761
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,720
but we've also got false positive

762
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,080
false negatives and then true negatives

763
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,239
what we're looking for

764
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,520
is as much accuracy as we can

765
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,159
and the dotted line in the middle is

766
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,199
average

767
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,119
meaning yeah you might as well throw a

768
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
paradise

769
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
to get an answer

770
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,879
sort of where we are right now with a

771
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,320
lot of things

772
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,119
and when we look at this world this way

773
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,239
what we start realizing is that what we

774
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,239
think is obvious

775
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,839
is not so obvious

776
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
i love this picture and i love this

777
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,040
analogy for detection and depth

778
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,280
this is a ge nx engine on triple sevens

779
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
87s

780
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,879
these engines

781
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,639
don't go bad while you're flying why

782
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,239
because they are the closest

783
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,399
approximation to the human brain

784
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
in systems engineering today there are 5

785
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,000
000 sensors inside each engine

786
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,920
sampling

787
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
specific pieces of the operation of

788
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,640
of inside the engine every second

789
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
a

790
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,400
transatlantic flight

791
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,359
400 terabytes of data

792
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,200
is collected

793
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
why

794
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,200
for the same reason that the human mind

795
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,440
and the human brain functions

796
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,920
is for survival to be able to predict

797
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
the future that's what we do in order to

798
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,079
survive we can predict the future

799
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,760
for a

800
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,160
few milliseconds a few seconds depends

801
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
upon the context

802
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,880
but when i'm sensing metal fatigue metal

803
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,839
temperature operational stability flow

804
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,240
rates of oxygen versus

805
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,720
and i've got hundreds of sensors doing

806
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,960
this

807
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
what do i care about when i'm in the

808
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,839
airplane i want to be able to predict

809
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,680
failure before it occurs

810
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,680
because we can fly in one engine and

811
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,160
land at a nearby airport

812
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,760
but

813
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,240
this engine is as close as the human

814
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
brain as we have in engineering today

815
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
so how do i measure some of this stuff

816
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,599
let's just take a quick look and these

817
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,640
are things that you can do

818
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,119
anybody wants the powerpoints great the

819
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
books downstairs if you care

820
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
we know from a vendor standpoint the

821
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,960
vendor says i'm going to be 99 accurate

822
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,079
is that any good

823
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,680
no that sucks

824
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,839
because if you have a hundred thousand

825
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,160
or two hundred a million emails coming

826
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,880
in

827
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,320
every day

828
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,200
ninety-nine percent accuracy says

829
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,800
one percent of that million that's 10

830
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,720
000

831
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,440
that are not going to get detected so

832
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,160
how do we verify what the vendor says

833
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,640
well we send in

834
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
good traffic

835
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,880
so we get a baseline of operation this

836
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,119
is an engineering concept baseline

837
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,040
operation

838
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,960
it's all good cool now what should

839
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,400
the vendor be able to detect and call

840
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,359
bad traffic in this case

841
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,599
well let's build that

842
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,520
and i'm going to inject that into the

843
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,079
same traffic path and while i do that

844
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,040
i'm going to start a clock

845
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,280
and that clock's going to start ticking

846
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,839
and i want to know

847
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
how long it takes that particular

848
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,960
detection system to detect the bad

849
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,160
traffic

850
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,800
so the output detects traffic stops the

851
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
clock and what do i have

852
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,280
i now know in this particular

853
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,839
environment whatever it is

854
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,040
how long the vendor's product takes to

855
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,280
actually do its job

856
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,960
so does an ids take one millisecond

857
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,760
does it take 30 seconds

858
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,240
is it hardware dependent

859
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,440
what other conditions and context will

860
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,599
change the ability of

861
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,040
an ids

862
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,760
of some sort to be able to work

863
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,359
reliably within a set of mid max

864
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,078
conditions

865
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,160
take the same concept on phishing

866
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,400
why don't i before

867
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,240
i allow somebody to respond to an email

868
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,560
or respond

869
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,880
to clicking to a website

870
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,960
in order to avoid a beef attack and

871
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,040
perhaps

872
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,599
why don't i institute a clock that

873
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
starts a process that evaluates

874
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,880
the probability of that link

875
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
or that email being hostile

876
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,599
if i'm really good at my job i should be

877
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,200
able to do that in a couple hundred

878
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
milliseconds because there's services

879
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
out there that we have now built into

880
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,760
our browsers that'll do it so all i want

881
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,920
to do

882
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
let's

883
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,599
turn off ssmtp on that particular

884
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,680
communication until i have a

885
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,960
probabilistic evaluation

886
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
of

887
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,520
the risk that that particular link has

888
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,400
the numbers are simple

889
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,040
the thinking is simple

890
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,680
but we have not gone this route yet

891
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
now to finish the argument

892
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,839
detection and reaction to understand

893
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,920
how much protection i really have or

894
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,280
really need

895
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,839
we do the same thing once my detection

896
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,280
test is known

897
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,119
i want to know what is my reaction

898
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,960
process do you have an automatic

899
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,200
reaction process it's part of a sore

900
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
platform okay that should be pretty

901
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,640
quick

902
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
measure it have any of you ever measured

903
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,200
the response of soar to a detection

904
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,200
why not

905
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,960
it gives you a lot of answers because

906
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,200
then it gives you the vulnerability and

907
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,599
risk is a function of time

908
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,640
throughout your operating environment

909
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,400
whether it's at code

910
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,720
network level human or physical

911
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
interactions

912
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,200
now some people say i'm going to use two

913
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,319
i'm going to use

914
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,240
two ids's

915
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,000
so they go well if either one of them

916
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,040
picks it up i'm good

917
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,440
unfortunately that's the wrong answer

918
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,000
because if i use two

919
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920
independent

920
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,200
malware detection systems and if either

921
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,640
one

922
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,240
is triggered

923
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,160
the reliability actually goes down

924
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,720
significantly

925
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
and again this is using bayesian

926
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,680
probability analysis what i want

927
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,599
is both systems to agree within a

928
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,839
specific period of time

929
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,720
just like we did with alice and bob

930
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
identifying themselves to a system the

931
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,079
principle is the same the math is the

932
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,119
same

933
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,839
everything about it is identical except

934
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,480
how do you actually implement it and are

935
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,359
you ready to think differently

936
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,040
so what can you do

937
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
go off and measure some of these things

938
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,760
take a look take a look at your systems

939
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,000
benchmark them in the laboratory look at

940
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560
the vendors products and

941
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
this is all stuff you can do it's not a

942
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,440
whole lot of code to do any of this

943
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
mark's gonna probably write you gonna

944
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,319
write all the code no i'm not gonna

945
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,000
commit him to writing all this code

946
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
what we need to do is start looking at

947
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,440
these systems using intrinsic feedback

948
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,839
systems looking at utah systems because

949
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,640
one level of feedback is one level of

950
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,480
attribution feedback

951
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,920
for one

952
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,640
small piece of time

953
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,839
this has to be a continuous process

954
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,880
think in terms of network security is a

955
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,200
bear

956
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,800
greg and i are out hunting

957
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,520
we're hunting bear we got our gun and

958
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,960
all of a sudden

959
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,560
as a bear

960
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,560
and it starts chasing us

961
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,520
greg takes off starts running as fast as

962
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,040
he can

963
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,880
what do i do

964
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,800
i sit down

965
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,520
and i take off my hunting boots

966
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,400
and i put on my really good nike

967
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
sneakers

968
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,720
and greg says win what are you doing

969
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,960
what do you got to outrun the bear and i

970
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,200
go no greg

971
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,799
i have to outrun you

972
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,960
network security is a bear

973
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,680
your homework is to do some of this try

974
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,440
some of these things

975
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,960
play with them

976
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
tell us where we're right

977
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
where we're wrong what the results that

978
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,079
you're seeing are

979
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,000
we may be wrong in some areas we would

980
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
love to get some of these ideas and

981
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,720
feedback again feedback in this case

982
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,680
positive feedback to be able to help us

983
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,920
make this whole process better

984
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,960
the axioms are there always have been uh

985
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,720
if you want to go through the provable

986
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,200
security model uh you can blame dr

987
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,480
carney uh for establishing uh

988
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,720
mathematically provable secure

989
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,079
environments

990
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,520
uh using the min max feedback premises

991
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,839
my book is downstairs for sale all of

992
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,640
these are free on amazon

993
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,680
and thank you very much and i've got 51

994
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,960
seconds left thank you
