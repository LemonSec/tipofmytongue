1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,800
good morning

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,319
nice to see everybody

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,040
my name is len no pronounce no opposite

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,480
of yes

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,000
and if you ask my parents i was named

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,679
very very appropriately i've heard len

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,920
no no no pretty much my whole damn

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,840
life uh i'm a technical evangelist white

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
hat and a biohacker i currently work for

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
cyberark software i'm a global security

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
speaker and i've been with my company

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,039
now for just over nine years

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
i've been in it professionally for going

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
on 26 years and roles ranging from

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
programmers to systems architects

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,719
and i've been breaking into computers

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,200
since the commodore 64 days and spent a

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,040
large amount of my time in my youth as a

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
black or a gray hat hacker

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,280
i'm professionally trained as well as

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
i've come by a lot of my knowledge

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
through practical application

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,039
i'm very active on social media and i

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
invite everyone here to reach out over

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
linkedin and check out my github and my

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,719
youtube channels for some additional

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,760
security related content

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,680
so i want to ask everyone here today a

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,559
very simple question to start this talk

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,359
what

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,240
does a cyborg look like

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
if you hear the question i'm sure that

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
you have something in your head and it

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,479
might look something like darth vader

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,560
maybe it looks like a cylon from

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
battlestar galactica the truth of the

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,799
matter is i i would be willing to bet

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
that it probably has some type of

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,680
robotic function or feature look

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
and the truth is that is just not the

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
case anymore

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,799
these are my hands

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,119
i am a biohacker in the truest sense of

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,159
the word

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,880
i am not only a white hat but i'm also

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,119
an augmented human who has decided to

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,200
take advantage of the available

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,159
implantable technology to turn myself

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
into the attack vector

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
i'm going to go through real quick and

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,479
i'm going to explain what my current

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,439
chips are unfortunately this particular

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,000
x-ray is a little bit out of date

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
that only looks like i have four

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
when the truth is i currently i have

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
eight i'm actually just healing up from

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,159
the last two that i implanted about a

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
week and a half ago

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,439
so

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,800
let's go ahead and i'm going to start

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,239
explaining what

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,920
kind of craziness i've decided to put

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,440
into my body

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
so the first chip you see here is called

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
a flex next

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
this is a combination rfid nfc chip

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,560
and it has a a very very large range and

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
yes i'm the texan that was down in the

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
front row so unfortunately i failed in

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
you know i remember back in the us when

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
i was back in primary school they were

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
like okay

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,000
we're all going to change to the metric

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
system on thursday

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,720
thursday came and we went yeah no

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,879
so somebody here might be able to help

77
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,280
me out here uh the range on this

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
particular chip is right about three and

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
a half to four

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,599
inches so what would that be in metric

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,238
here anybody

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,239
10

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,200
about 10 10 okay i'll take that you

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
could be lying through me like i said i

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
failed that day in school

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
but this allows me the ability to

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
actually have enough range on this

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,599
microchip to be actually able to hold a

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
cell phone or a mobile device in the

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
proper correct orientation and still be

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
able to trigger the the reader within

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,519
the mobile device

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,879
excuse me

94
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,879
i have what is called a next chip this

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
was actually the very first implant that

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,599
i ever got it's exactly the same as the

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,360
larger flex next the only major

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,959
difference between the two

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,200
is the range this one i have maybe about

100
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
a half an inch

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
so yeah about that much you almost have

102
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
to be sitting directly on top of the

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,280
receiver uh i'll be going into a more

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
thorough description of the actual

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
implants within it in the next couple of

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
slides

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
as i said my original purpose for

108
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
actually getting these was for the

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
purposes of offensive security and this

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,720
just didn't need meet my needs as far as

111
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
being able to properly socially engineer

112
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
the ability to connect with that

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
receiver

114
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,519
i have a flex m1 magic

115
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
uh this chip allows me to emulate any

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
number of older access cards from public

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,239
transit to membership tokens or other

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
physical access

119
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,439
i have what is called a vivoki spark ii

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,200
this is actually a cryptobionic chip

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
that can perform strong cryptographic uh

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,639
functions

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,880
actually has a companion app on my cell

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,759
phone is actually part of a triple

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,440
factor authentication to access my

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,840
cryptocurrency

127
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,600
wallet uh since the time these histories

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
were taken i actually have four

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
additional implants

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
i have a flex em this allows me to

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
emulate most of the popular current

132
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,840
physical access cards including prox two

133
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
and three hid indala pyramid and a ton

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,800
more

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,360
i have a titan biomagnet in my pinky

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
this allows me to actually be able to

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
feel electromagnetic fields and

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
electromagnetic currents

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
and i get the question all the time you

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
know so what does that actually do for

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,600
you

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,080
uh to my readout people that were up

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
here before me i've seen your product

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
before guys

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,320
love it

146
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
uh

147
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
if we're dealing with a physical

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
penetration test i i like i said i come

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
from the united states where most of our

150
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
warehouses are using some type of

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,199
magnetic lock for their exterior entry

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,560
systems

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
this allows me the ability to actually

154
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
run my hands over the outside of the

155
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
wall and actually be able to trace the

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
electrical conduit to where the magnets

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
are and the hopes of trying to find a

158
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
place to be able to shim those locks

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
uh with and two weeks ago i actually

160
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,560
just put in a flex des fire v2

161
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,360
this is a

162
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,520
13.56 megahertz iso 14 443 a and nfc

163
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,919
type 4 des fire ev2 chip with 8

164
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,560
kilobytes of memory so it's got a lot of

165
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
storage available in it

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
and uh just for the fun of it and i in

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,639
the front of my left hand i put a chip

168
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
it's called the wallet more

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,199
this is actually a credit card

170
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
processing chip

171
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
it's a prepaid cr debit or credit card

172
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
that i can actually use my hand to do

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
tap to pay the same way that you would

174
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
do with apple pay or android wallets

175
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
uh i'm currently in the process of

176
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
working with the

177
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,199
distributor within the united states a

178
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
company called dangerous things and i'll

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
even get this question out of the way in

180
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
front here here in europe you guys have

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,080
an amazing distributor called k-sec

182
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
that basically deal with the same type

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,759
of

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
technological implants and if you you

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,479
find this stuff interesting hit me up

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,600
after this

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
my talk i'd be happy to help

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
steer you in the correct way to joining

189
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,120
me in the realms of being a transhuman

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
so i am in the process of working on

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,759
getting a customized peg leg built but

192
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,880
we're going to talk about that in a

193
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
couple of slides

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
so as i said

195
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
augmented humans are not science fiction

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
we are science fact and we are here and

197
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,840
we're not going anywhere and as the

198
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,080
technology will continue to evolve so

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,039
will we

200
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,800
and as security professionals we need to

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
be aware of these new attack vectors and

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
be able to layer our security in order

203
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
to be able to

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,319
so excuse me layer our security in order

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,639
to be able to counter measure these new

206
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,880
attack vectors

207
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,039
so i've broken the talk into three quick

208
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
parts

209
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,800
yesterday today and tomorrow i'm not

210
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
going to spend a whole lot of time on

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
the history of the trans-human movement

212
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
just enough to show that the biohacker

213
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
trans human or grinder is actually just

214
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
the point where science technology and

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
humanity have all collided

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
the idea behind implanting technology

217
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
inside the human body has been around

218
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
since the 1950s

219
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,960
uh the patent for the first cardiac

220
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
pacemaker was submitted in the united

221
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
states in 1952 and and was actually the

222
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,240
size of a table radio

223
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,840
the first

224
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,520
with the advent of the transistor in the

225
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
mid-1950s the ability to construct the

226
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
fully implantable device was achieved in

227
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,680
may of 1958.

228
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
uh the first human to really actually

229
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,599
receive an electronical device implanted

230
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
into the body was in buffalo new york in

231
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,360
1960.

232
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,680
uh 1964 gave host to the first

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
implantable technology that could

234
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
actually take data from the body as

235
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
feedback and re

236
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,000
give

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,360
varied responses based on that input

238
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,759
uh the 70s and 80s there were a lot of

239
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
different advancements in biomedical but

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,280
nothing that would really set the world

241
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,479
on its ear

242
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,799
1990 is when things really started to

243
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,760
pick up

244
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
for the biomed

245
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,839
from the creation of smart devices all

246
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,320
the way through to smart prosthetics to

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
where today the concepts and discussions

248
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,919
around artificial intelligence and

249
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,519
machine learning are pretty commonplace

250
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
for biohackers our history was forged by

251
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
the medical profession to addre address

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
deficiencies

253
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
of the human body but it was always from

254
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
a reactive perspective and by that i

255
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
mean the the issues were already there

256
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,959
and there was really no options for an

257
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,880
individual to be able to enhance

258
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
themselves through

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,519
technology

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,320
so

261
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
who are we today

262
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
today

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
people like myself are referred to by

264
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,839
like i said all kinds of different names

265
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,880
i've been called a biohacker a grinder a

266
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
transhuman somebody even called me a

267
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
wetwork when i was in sweden a couple of

268
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
weeks ago don't really know how to

269
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
respond to that one but to each their

270
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
own

271
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
regardless of whatever name you want to

272
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
put on us we all share the concept of

273
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
moving beyond the human form that we

274
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
were born into

275
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
the term transhuman was actually first

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,640
coined by julian huxley back in 1957

277
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
and the movement he created was fueled

278
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
by multiple people looking to extend the

279
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
capabilities of the human body itself

280
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
so where do you find implantable

281
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
technology anybody want to guess

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
come on this is a this is a security

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,839
conference where do we find

284
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,519
everything thank you

285
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
the internet

286
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
we can find anything on the internet

287
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,440
uh there are multiple different

288
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
manufacturers to choose from like i said

289
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
before i personally work exclusively

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
with a company called dangerous things

291
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
out of seattle washington i don't work

292
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,399
for them i don't get a kickback from

293
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,200
them

294
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
they're just the ones that i've done the

295
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
research and they're the ones that i

296
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
feel comfortable with uh if i was

297
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,839
actually here in europe i would be using

298
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
a company called k-sec

299
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
so what type of commercial-grade

300
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,360
implants are available

301
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
so we actually have magnets

302
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
that we have both lifting magnets as

303
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
well as biosensing magnets

304
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
we have flexible membrane

305
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,839
nfc or near field communication chips we

306
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
have flexible membrane rfid chips

307
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
we have bio glass encapsulated

308
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,399
uh nfc and rfid and even combination

309
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,519
chips

310
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,040
and if you recall from when we were

311
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
looking at my x-rays earlier you can see

312
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
the differences here very clearly with

313
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
the amount of coiled copper we have for

314
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
antennas under the flexible membrane as

315
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
opposed to the entire chip being encased

316
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
in that little piece of bio glass

317
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
those bio glass implants are not much

318
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,880
larger than a one piece of long grain

319
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,079
rice

320
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,360
so they work but at the same time the

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,399
range on them is much much smaller

322
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,839
and i i i really i know that you guys

323
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
here in paris and europe you guys are a

324
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
party bunch so i've saved the best for

325
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
last we even have the ability to implant

326
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
leds

327
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
so when you guys go out to the raves you

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,839
got the glow stick in one hand and you

329
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
can look like iron man in the other hand

330
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
you know i'm not going to go into the

331
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,320
procedures on how we implant these uh

332
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
devices but let's just say at a minimum

333
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,040
you're looking at needles that are about

334
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
a four gauge

335
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,399
if you're into body piercing so that's

336
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,760
about the size of a pencil or a pen

337
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,160
and on the worst case you're looking at

338
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,240
scalpel's dermal elevators and sutures

339
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
so yes i'm quite dedicated to my craft

340
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
these devices were actually designed to

341
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,680
make people's lives easier

342
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,360
you know imagine

343
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
you know we have the ability to start

344
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,000
our vehicles

345
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
there's actually a implant if you have a

346
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
tesla model 3 that will you can actually

347
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
put your valet

348
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
signal on the chip and you can just get

349
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
in your car and drive

350
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
how many people have fobs to access a

351
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,279
gym or maybe a shared garage or a

352
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,880
storage unit

353
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240
all of these would be considered

354
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,480
legitimate use cases for implantable

355
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,240
technology

356
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,360
you know

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
i like i said i now have the ability to

358
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
pay for goods and services the same way

359
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
that you could with apple pay or android

360
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
wallet

361
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,959
and i will say from a personal

362
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,360
perspective there's nothing more amusing

363
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
than walking up to a vending machine

364
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
tapping your hand grabbing a soda and

365
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
watching everybody around you just lose

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
their mind

367
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
i actually had one person come up behind

368
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,079
me and just start smacking

369
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,440
you know the receiver with their hand

370
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,839
going why can't i get one

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
but every one of these particular use

372
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
cases would constitute a legitimate use

373
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,200
case

374
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,240
for one of these types of devices

375
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
unfortunately

376
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,040
not all of us are friendly

377
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
as security professionals we need to

378
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
start looking beyond what we're

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
comfortable with

380
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
beyond the normal attack vectors that

381
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,199
we've been hearing about for years

382
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,120
the attacks in the endgame may not have

383
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
changed but the delivery methods have

384
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,279
come right off of the movie screen and

385
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
into our companies our infrastructures

386
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,639
in our data centers

387
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
security admins know the normal attack

388
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
vectors but how do you address the fact

389
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
that any one of your employees or

390
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
visitors could potentially have a full

391
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
linux system beneath their skin

392
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,959
what if someone implanted an hid or a

393
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,120
proximity access chip there would be no

394
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,800
evidence of any type

395
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
to the naked eye of a physical

396
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
compromise of a physical location

397
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
it's not like the old days where i'd

398
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
have a prox mark or some type of chip

399
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,920
cloner

400
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
i can just write that data into my one

401
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,040
of my implants access your your secured

402
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
locations on-prem and even if you catch

403
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,920
me

404
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,839
what's the worst that's going to happen

405
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,959
you know the police are going to come up

406
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,160
they're going to search me and all i

407
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,519
have to say is look man i was touring

408
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,519
the building the door was open i thought

409
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,800
this room looked pretty cool had a bunch

410
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
of computers in it

411
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
they can search me they'll never find

412
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,120
any type of nefarious tools

413
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
and at the end of the day all they're

414
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
going to do is trespass me and kick me

415
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
off your property

416
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,279
chip implants utilize the exact same

417
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,000
technologies that enterprises are using

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
rfid

419
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,320
door badges nfc for iot

420
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,839
my fare hid procs or pyramid and these

421
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
are just a few

422
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
with the number of regulations and

423
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,000
audits that companies are required to do

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
for compliance

425
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
how would you know if someone has

426
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
bypassed your security policy and

427
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,920
brought a rogue asset into your

428
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,279
environment

429
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,639
under the skin

430
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,440
the simple answer is you wouldn't

431
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
this is called a peg leg

432
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,800
this is a single board computer that's

433
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
been modified to a minimalist form

434
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,279
factor with a wireless charging receiver

435
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,519
then encased in biopolymer

436
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
and implanted within the body typically

437
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,399
it's

438
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,240
implanted right here

439
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
underneath the pocket

440
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
and the reason being is there's no

441
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
battery on this

442
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,759
what you would do is you would take a

443
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,160
wireless charging external battery slide

444
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
it into your pants pocket it would then

445
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
energize the receiver and you could

446
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
actually access it via your cell phone

447
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
you know the possibilities of a

448
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
concealed linux system are only limited

449
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,360
by one's imagination

450
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
these devices have wi-fi bluetooth

451
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,399
capabilities and like i said you can ssh

452
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,040
directly to these over your cell phone

453
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,800
and yes you can put cali on them

454
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
i'm actually in the process of working

455
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
with dangerous things right now to

456
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,480
actually get a custom-made pcb

457
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,160
i'm not going to use a raspberry pi zero

458
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,320
w there's only one wi-fi on it

459
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,600
so i've actually been working with a

460
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,199
kai-cad designer and we've actually

461
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,320
designed a raspberry pi zero that i call

462
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,279
the the hacker edition

463
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,120
it actually has dual wi-fi so i can

464
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
actually perform things like wi-fi

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
pumpkin

466
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,079
and

467
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,839
we've actually also added the ability to

468
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
do usb sharing so i can actually hook it

469
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
up to say a crazy radio pa and be able

470
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,639
to do responder and

471
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,199
jack excuse me mouse jacking and jacket

472
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,480
attacks

473
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,160
triggered off of my cell phone

474
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
at the rate i'm going though it probably

475
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,839
may be q4 or early 2023 before we're

476
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,519
finally done with all the testing i may

477
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,959
be crazy

478
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,560
but i'm not stupid

479
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
so as a result i am very cautious as to

480
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
what i put into my body i want to make

481
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
sure that it's not going to leak any

482
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
type of heavy metals and cause me any

483
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
type of health issues later on down the

484
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,599
road

485
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
so

486
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
let's talk about some of the attack

487
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,240
vectors

488
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,599
the first one i'm going to show you guys

489
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,599
today is around the issue of physical

490
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,280
access

491
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,799
any company will have restricted

492
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,359
locations on-prem it's just kind of the

493
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
what the ways of doing business not

494
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,799
everybody will always have access to

495
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,160
everything

496
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
uh i'd be willing to bet that probably

497
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
somebody in attendance here has a work

498
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
badge on them

499
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,280
anybody want to raise a hand

500
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,000
okay i got at least one appreciate it

501
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
let's talk about how easy it is to

502
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
actually do this

503
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,200
so the first attack i've since they're

504
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
my attack vectors i got to name them the

505
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
first one i named handshake

506
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,760
handshake is a clone and replay attack

507
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,160
utilizes a tool like a prox mark or a

508
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,799
flipper zero to read the data contained

509
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,799
on a card or a fob

510
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,200
and then i'm going to use that same data

511
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
write it down to one of my implants in

512
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
this case it's going to be the tag

513
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
implant in my left hand

514
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,720
so i'm a very very interactive presenter

515
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
i'm very transparent i want you guys to

516
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
see this because the truth is we'll get

517
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,160
to the fact that there's no way to stop

518
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
this in terms of detection when we get

519
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
to the end of the

520
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
presentation

521
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
so let's go ahead and let's kick it off

522
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
i'm going to start off by firing off my

523
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,760
proxmark chameleon tool

524
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
and yes that is my old badge and yes i

525
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
look like every hacker piece of hack or

526
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,960
clip art you've ever seen in your life

527
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
so as you can see we've got a new uid

528
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
that was actually imported

529
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
from here we can go in we can actually

530
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
take a look at the sectors that were

531
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
scraped we're going to go ahead and give

532
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,679
this a friendly name of lens id

533
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
from here

534
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
now we have our baseline let's go ahead

535
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,760
and scan my implant

536
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
so quickly

537
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
now we will see that we have a new uid

538
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
that's been imported

539
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
we can open up that take a look at the

540
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,559
sectors

541
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,480
and we can we're going to go ahead and

542
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
we're going to rename that one to

543
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,799
implant

544
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
now at this point

545
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
you know

546
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
if you're part of any type of larger

547
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
hacker collective this information is

548
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,360
now able to be actually shared amongst

549
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
your group so just for the show how easy

550
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
it is i'm going to upload both of these

551
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,400
things into google drive and share them

552
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
out with all of my buddies and the next

553
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
thing you know we're going to start

554
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,400
hanging out in your your break room and

555
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
drinking all your coffee

556
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
from here i'm going to open up the

557
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,559
myfair classic tool and keep in mind in

558
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
this particular example all of the stuff

559
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
i'm doing is being executed from my cell

560
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,760
phone so it's not like i need any

561
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
additional tools

562
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
so we're going to import pull those down

563
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,000
out of google drive into the myfair

564
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
classic tool and then we're going to run

565
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
a diff command against them and we're

566
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,840
going to actually take a look at what's

567
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
different between my implant and my my

568
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
original id

569
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
so we come up select the

570
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,600
the implant select the id

571
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,200
and you'll see that the only thing that

572
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,559
is different between the two is sector

573
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,000
zero line a

574
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,520
at this point all i have to do is just

575
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
actually say write

576
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,440
the data

577
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,600
map go ahead and we'll

578
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,679
write this down to the

579
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,240
chip in my hand

580
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,679
and it was very difficult trying to show

581
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
you guys every step of this because some

582
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,799
of it's actually on my body and some of

583
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,240
it's on a computer screen so i'm doing

584
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,159
the best i can and i hope you're able to

585
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,520
follow along

586
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
at this point now we'll go ahead and

587
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,840
we'll just map all the sectors for

588
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,039
verification and then turn around and

589
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,679
use the proxmart chameleon once again

590
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,919
and we'll go ahead and get a new read

591
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
and then compare

592
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,400
the original id to what's on the implant

593
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
now

594
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
so we go ahead we scan the implant the

595
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,039
second time imports the uid we're going

596
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,880
to go ahead and name this one implant

597
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,200
two

598
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,760
and at this point if you take a look

599
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
and we should be jumping back into

600
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,960
lens id

601
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
and if you take a look the last couple

602
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,280
of

603
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,679
characters are six eight six zero

604
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,320
then we can go into my implant two and

605
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
it's six eight six zero

606
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,120
so now i have an exact duplicate

607
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,799
of your id sitting on my hand

608
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,480
now the as i said one of this may not be

609
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,159
brand new because people have been

610
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,720
scanning and cloning id cards now for

611
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,280
over a decade what makes this a little

612
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
bit different is the fact that i can now

613
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,679
compromise that same information and i

614
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
can do it with absolutely zero

615
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
indications of compromise if i'm

616
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,520
actually detected

617
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,039
uh the next two attacks i'm going to

618
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,640
show you guys today are going to be

619
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
around the technologies of near field

620
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,960
communication

621
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,720
you know it's an amazing technology and

622
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,159
many of us have it in our pockets right

623
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,360
now

624
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
every android device has full access to

625
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,679
transmit or receive nsc data standard

626
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
nfc utilization could be anything from

627
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,679
beaming a file

628
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,000
to using an app to transmit a signal to

629
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,159
a receiver to allow some type of action

630
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,840
to take place

631
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,120
the implant that i'm going to be using

632
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
for the next two examples is going to be

633
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
that large flex next

634
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,440
and in case i didn't show y'all that's

635
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,720
what it looks like in the body

636
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
so yeah like i said i'm dedicated to my

637
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,039
craft

638
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,400
so the first one i'm going to show you

639
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
guys is leprosy again my attack i got to

640
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
name it

641
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,520
this attack may not always work it also

642
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,960
will not currently work against iphones

643
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,679
due to the proprietaryism of their nfc

644
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,400
chip but if you've been following the

645
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
news lately apple is actually currently

646
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
being

647
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,480
sued over the proprietaryism of this

648
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,720
chip in the european courts

649
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
and they lost the the battle against the

650
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,799
lightning charger so

651
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,520
i think it's a 50 50 as to whether or

652
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
not they're actually going to lose the

653
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
ability to lock down that nfc chip if

654
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,360
they do the iphones will be just as

655
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,919
vulnerable as the androids

656
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,280
so

657
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,880
this one is pretty pretty simple

658
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
all i have to do is actually get the

659
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
device in my hand

660
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,919
and

661
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,440
this is at this point it's just a matter

662
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,760
of social engineering the situation

663
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
uh this attack as well as flash hook are

664
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
designed to be actually performed in

665
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,600
plain sight and actually in the presence

666
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,679
of my targets

667
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,080
you know this is a wonderful conference

668
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,320
i'm very grateful to be here

669
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,000
we've got a lot of wonderful people here

670
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
today you know if i was to start making

671
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,159
a big scene about an issue with my wife

672
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
or my daughter or my granddaughter

673
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,600
you know and i was pleading for somebody

674
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
to help me make a phone call because my

675
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,559
phone died

676
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,480
i know that the good samaritan

677
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,799
and somebody here would be here to be my

678
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
victim

679
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,720
once the phone or tablet is in my hands

680
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,240
the receiver and the device will pick up

681
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,919
the tag i have programmed in my hand

682
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,200
that is currently pointing to a web

683
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
location containing an infected apk that

684
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,640
i used msf venom to create

685
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,919
so

686
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,520
as as i'm sitting there going through

687
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
the motions of freaking out trying to

688
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,799
remember a phone number what i'm

689
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,120
actually doing is installing this apk on

690
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,039
your device and then quickly giving it

691
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
back to you

692
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,279
so i'm going to do this in real time

693
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
so just as i said before i'm a very

694
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,000
transparent presenter i want you guys to

695
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,320
learn and hopefully you can actually get

696
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
something out of this so i'm using an

697
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
ngrok session in the top for obfuscation

698
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,080
and i'm going to actually launch

699
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,720
metasploit in the lower count window

700
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
so we kick off metasploit and load up a

701
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,960
resource file and start a listener

702
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
and as soon as we switch over i'm going

703
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
to go into my actual act here

704
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
ready let's go ahead and

705
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
start the listener

706
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,400
oh my god can somebody help me out here

707
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
so you know my granddaughter was just in

708
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,039
an accident my phone died uh oh thank

709
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,559

710
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,919
all right now i gotta remember what's

711
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,440

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
anymore we you know everything's

716
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480

seven three four five

723
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,930
seven three four five six one

724
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,240
[Music]

725
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,679
man i really appreciate i'm just gonna

726
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,840
go plug my phone

727
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,760
in we're done

728
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,200
i've popped a reverse shell on your

729
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,159
device

730
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,760
you know and i'm not going to go really

731
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,559
too heavy into the post exploitation

732
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,240
but i mean i can do run sys info

733
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,039
dump your call logs dump your smses even

734
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
pop a shell if you're on

735
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,320
an android and traverse your entire file

736
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,679
structure

737
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
upload things download things at this

738
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
point it's basically whatever i want to

739
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,200
do

740
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,159
so

741
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,159
just to show yep there's an ls against

742
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,360
the sd card in my in the cell phone

743
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,559
and it it's that quick

744
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,360
so the final use case that i'm going to

745
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,159
show you guys today is one that i excuse

746
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,120
me i've named flesh hook

747
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,840
this one is a little bit more dangerous

748
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
because this one is cross platform if

749
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,320
you're you have an iphone i'll get you

750
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,520
if you have an android i'll get you

751
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
in this one particular use case i

752
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
programmed the chip in my hand to point

753
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
to a website that i have infected with

754
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,799
the beef suite

755
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,799
and if anybody here not familiar with

756
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,960
beef

757
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
okay i see a couple of hands

758
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
beef is the browser extension exploit

759
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,520
framework this is the the website that

760
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
we've all heard about where it's like if

761
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
you go to a website the bad guys can

762
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,240
hack you the minute you bring up the

763
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
webpage

764
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,279
yes that's true

765
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,440
this is the tool that does it

766
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
so in this case

767
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,840
you know i deal with a lot of i.t people

768
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,159
so what i've done is i've actually made

769
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
a copy of the putty website and

770
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,520
basically infected it with the java hook

771
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,960
from beef

772
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
so

773
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
this requires as i said just a little

774
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
bit of social engineering but you know

775
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,240
if we just went through that exercise in

776
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,799
the last example you know if i'm making

777
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,559
a big scene and making a fool out of

778
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
myself somebody's going to try and help

779
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,039
me

780
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,840
so let's see how this one looks in

781
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,279
reality again

782
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,600
we go ahead and we kick off beef

783
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,840
and the scary thing is this actually

784
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,399
takes longer to actually start beef than

785
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,679
it does to actually compromise the

786
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
device

787
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,360
and as long as that web page stays up i

788
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,039
have a connection and through the

789
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
modules within the beef suite i can

790
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
actually gain permanent persistence as

791
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,880
well as do on-device spear phishing

792
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,159
attacks

793
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,840
so we can bring up the beef control

794
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,240
panel and log in as as the administrator

795
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,120
beef

796
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,799
beef

797
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,240
funny i'm from texas i never really put

798
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,480
those two and two together

799
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
but as you can see over on the left hand

800
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
side we have a bunch of previous

801
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
devices that i was able to hook here's

802
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,000
some really ugly guy with a bad beard

803
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,279
you know again

804
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,960
all i'm doing is hey let me see your

805
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,559
phone i got a bit youtube video i want

806
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,600
to show you

807
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
i click this throw that pull this up

808
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
quickly go into your youtube

809
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
but at this point i've already hooked

810
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
the browser within beef

811
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,919
from the generals first page i can gain

812
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,840
all kinds of system information in

813
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,159
regards to what type of device

814
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,360
firmware

815
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,960
all kinds of things

816
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
from there it also allows me access to

817
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
the complete embedded suite of all of

818
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
the tools within the beef suite i can

819
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
get geo loca i can geo locate your

820
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,640
device

821
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
if you are part of a

822
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,120
lan i can enumerate your network

823
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,399
i can

824
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,679
do a dns reverse sweep

825
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,480
the suite provides all kinds of things

826
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,559
so as you can see i ran a geo location

827
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,159
and it says that i'm in flugerville

828
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,840
texas and that's pretty much where i was

829
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,799
when i actually ran this

830
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,919
we have the ability to get persistence

831
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,480
uh i can even depending on the firmware

832
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,559
of your device i can turn on your

833
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,279
cameras and list your microphones and i

834
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,200
can actually see and listen to whatever

835
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,240
is going on wherever you are

836
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,520
just to show what

837
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,880
the fun of it i'm going to go ahead and

838
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
do a ping sweep for everything that is

839
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,159
actually on the network that i'm

840
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,640
currently on and return that back just

841
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,720
as a way to show that we've got some

842
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
data

843
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
so we kind of talked a little bit about

844
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
where the transhuman came from

845
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
we've talked about what types of

846
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
capabilities there are for people like

847
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,399
myself in the world today

848
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
so let's talk a little bit about where

849
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,520
are we going to be going in the future

850
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,039
when we talk about the future of

851
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,600
implants and implanted technologies

852
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,200
it's like we're trying to write a brand

853
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,520
new science fiction movie

854
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,360
companies like tesla are working on

855
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
technology like the neuralink

856
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,240
this is a basically what is called a bci

857
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,360
or a brain computer interface

858
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
this will allow interfacing between the

859
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,679
brain directly to a computer system

860
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,200
from my perspective that sounds like a

861
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
man-in-the-middle scenario just waiting

862
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,399
to happen

863
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,600
you know not many have ever heard of

864
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
another company called syncron

865
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,840
they are neurolinks actually biggest

866
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,919
competitor and they are currently in

867
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,360
human trials

868
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
and they're showing an amazing results

869
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,720
we have products like the will it

870
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,399
this is a bluetooth receiver that

871
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
requires no batteries and gets its power

872
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,080
from the air

873
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,159
and everybody knows that bluetooth is

874
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,000
not vulnerable and the most secure thing

875
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,679
in the world right

876
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,279
wrong

877
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,960
ever heard of blueborne

878
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,799
imagine if that could actually instead

879
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,559
of jumping from device to device could

880
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,760
jump from a person to a person

881
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,440
what about implantable wi-fi

882
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
transmitters and receivers

883
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,919
there's a product in development right

884
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,640
now called the neuro grain

885
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
their hope is to turn the human race

886
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,720
into the world's largest wi-fi network

887
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,039
through a mesh and be able to bring

888
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,000
wi-fi access to places that most people

889
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,240
would not be able to get it

890
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
this to me sounds like

891
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
we may be able to redefine the old term

892
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,760
if i'm hacking my my neighbor's wi-fi

893
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,919
these are just what we know about you

894
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,519
know currently the biggest restriction

895
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,600
to advanced technology implants is the

896
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,279
power source

897
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,120
there is currently no effective way to

898
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,600
provide clean power to any devices on a

899
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,840
commercial-grade implant

900
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,360
it's the same reason why when we were

901
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,519
showing the peg leg earlier

902
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,080
that we're using that indirect power

903
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
receiver

904
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
anybody here ever charge their phone

905
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
wirelessly on one of those wireless

906
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,200
charging pads

907
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,640
how hot is it when you pick it up

908
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,000
that is not something that you want

909
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,360
going on inside your body

910
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,880
uh it's not always the computer

911
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,840
technology that is holding up progress

912
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,120
in this case

913
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,919
the

914
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,679
technology that needs to catch up is the

915
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,360
power source

916
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
you know and once that's been addressed

917
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
the possibilities of a 24x7 access to

918
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,080
embedded system within the body is not

919
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,480
that far off

920
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,679
so

921
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,679
i try to keep at least 10 minutes of my

922
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,519
time because usually i have a lot of

923
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,360
questions so

924
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,860
at this point i'd like to open the floor

925
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:26,149
[Applause]

926
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,840
who wants to be the first one to ask me

927
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,720
how i get through airports

928
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
i was going to ask you another question

929
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,320
how do you get through airports uh i

930
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,640
walk through the metal detector

931
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,440
they never catch it

932
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,320
none i've been through the magnetometers

933
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,720
i've been through the x-rays uh when it

934
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
comes to air travel

935
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
and i'm going to carbon date myself here

936
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
again i'm from the united states and so

937
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
are you so you'll remember this

938
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
before the the transportation safety

939
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,640
advisory

940
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,960
council or tsa

941
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,799
airport security was actually privately

942
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,360
contracted and i was a airport security

943
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,559
guard

944
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,360
and i

945
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,760
don't quote me on this but granted this

946
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,240
was over 20 some odd years ago in order

947
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,880
to set off a magnetometer at an airport

948
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
you needed to have the total combined

949
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,360
metallic weight of a 22 bullet

950
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
and the problem is if you think about my

951
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,559
implants

952
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
the only thing that are metal is the

953
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,440
antennas everything else is silicon

954
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,840
with the exception of my my titan

955
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,159
biomagnet which is an iron core wrapped

956
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,519
in titanium

957
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,640
but the total metallic mass is not

958
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
enough to actually set off a metal

959
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,880
detector

960
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
that'll even find this

961
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,000
nope

962
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
and even if they did

963
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,360
it's within the skin i know within the

964
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,080
united states we have laws like hipaa

965
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,399
they're not allowed to ask

966
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
i i'm assuming that there are similar

967
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,080
regulations in terms of health and

968
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,399
privacy here within europe so even if

969
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,000
they come up and

970
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,120
something did which i have been

971
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,039
international flying for

972
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,640
years with these things

973
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,119
i've never triggered any magnetometer

974
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,040
any x-ray the only thing that scares me

975
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,918
in this life are stronger magnets and

976
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,320
mri machines

977
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,079
because you know

978
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,359
you know everybody's like you know len

979
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,879
you're you're this big you know

980
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,199
intimidating scary looking person i am

981
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,199
terrified of magnets

982
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,119
do you know how much it hurts

983
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,760
to have an a magnet inside your skin and

984
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,280
then somebody come up with like an earth

985
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,639
magnet and snap it on there you've you

986
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
don't know pain until you've been

987
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,918
pinched on the inside and outside of

988
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,520
your skin

989
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,480
so

990
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,159
there are a lot of different things but

991
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,599
the truth is

992
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
there is no detection capability for

993
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,359
this right now

994
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,000
i mean all of my implants

995
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,320
are passive so that means they get their

996
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
power from the receivers

997
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,079
so while i'm just standing here if

998
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,599
there's no high frequency or low

999
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
frequency reader they're dormant

1000
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,560
in order to stop somebody like me you

1001
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
would need to have some type of spectrum

1002
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,640
analyzer listing on both high frequency

1003
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
and low frequency all the time

1004
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
to that point

1005
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,280
uh within the united states like i said

1006
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,079
i live in just outside of austin texas i

1007
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,599
was reading an article a couple of weeks

1008
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,800
ago where

1009
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,119
there is a new type of

1010
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,880
police canine that's coming out on the

1011
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,680
scene

1012
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,119
they now have technology sniffing dogs

1013
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,640
these are being primarily used in

1014
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,680
terms of combating human trafficking

1015
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,400
child pornography things of that nature

1016
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
and they've trained these dogs to be

1017
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,839
able to try and smell

1018
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,760
specific parts of technological

1019
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
components

1020
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
so i've reached out to them and i've

1021
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,720
actually been invited up to dallas to

1022
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
see whether or not these technology

1023
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,320
sniffing dogs may be able to sniff the

1024
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,599
tech the

1025
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,240
technology within my implants

1026
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,480
and just from an outside perspective if

1027
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
you think back to the terminator movies

1028
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
you know the resistance was always down

1029
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,480
underground and they always had dogs

1030
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
sniffing

1031
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
to try and find

1032
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
the cyborgs

1033
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
and it's funny because i look at it and

1034
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
i wonder is this a situation where life

1035
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,079
is going to imitate art or art is going

1036
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,000
to imitate life

1037
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,240
but currently there is no way to detect

1038
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,440
me

1039
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,920
so the only way to deal with this

1040
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,240
is to honestly go with a true layered

1041
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
security approach

1042
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,400
you know don't have single points of

1043
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
failure one of the things that i love to

1044
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,480
point out is you know we have no problem

1045
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
putting multi-factor authentication in

1046
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,640
front of any of our high-value data but

1047
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,079
how many times when you walk into

1048
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,640
someone's data center there's just a

1049
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
badge reader on the door that you scan

1050
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
and you walk right in

1051
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,320
you know if you want to stop people like

1052
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
me you're going to have to start

1053
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,359
layering that security it's going to

1054
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,000
have to be multi-factored something that

1055
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,480
i can't necessarily replicate onto any

1056
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,400
of my current implants all right well

1057
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,480
with that i will give the remaining 30

1058
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,400
seconds back and i'd like to thank you

1059
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,839
guys very much for the opportunity to

1060
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,200
come and present and i hope you guys

1061
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,919
enjoy the rest of the conference
