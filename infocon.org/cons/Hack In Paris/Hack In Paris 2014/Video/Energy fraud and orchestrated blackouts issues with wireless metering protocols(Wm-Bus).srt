1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,660
OK hello I can't agree to you too might
talk

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,899
always speaking about well as metering
protocols

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:10,950
my name is simple and relearn I

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,090
tom also from Switzerland Sebastian does

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,029
I come from the German speaking part I
work in a company which has a similar

6
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,100
profile us

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,210
assist rem and Serg also have

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,789
and I've been studying for a master's of

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,990
the from science in

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,930
information security at the Royal
Holloway University and

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,170
the output of my studies there for the
most cities is basically what I'm gonna

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,440
presented

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,510
so for those who have seen my talk at
the black cat

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,190
it maybe you're better off to have a
coffee outside and not come back for the

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,210
demo afterwards

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,140
for everyone else try to stay here

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,989
I don't have a nice girls in my slides
but ship is still fun

18
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,710
alright um I will quickly go to the

19
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,650
Judy a smart grid and smart metering
infrastructure all show you some picture

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,280
of

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,630
devices I would and I've been to the
wireless me to protocol

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,760
and show you the issues with the
protocol and I will show you

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,380
a short time afterwards um

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,659
if we talk about the smart grid there is
a

25
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,790
bout generation storage part of two
great they're spread a massive the

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,850
energy is being

27
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,009
generated and does will be transmit

28
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,579
the operators call terror art from

29
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,840
transmission service operators TS those

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,479
and their RDS those these are those ones
who are be basically carrying the energy

31
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,799
to two cities

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,950
and will be distributed 10

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,909
to the house system Asus and there it's
gonna be interesting because

34
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,399
I'm we do have lots of consumers and

35
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,869
people try to get their own engine to
the great and sell it to the year so

36
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:07,320
and they're starting to kind of also
virtualizing the energy infrastructure

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,399
so they build little BP's

38
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,230
virtual private plans so where they try
to arrange consumers and producers

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,420
in in little cells um and for that
purpose

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,599
you must somehow makes decreed
intelligent

41
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,989
and there for you need to smart metering
infrastructure

42
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,930
so you have proper information and
real-time information but currently is

43
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,030
being consumed and generated

44
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,840
at 24 and off the grid so if you look at
the metering infrastructure than we do

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,920
have two meters

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,810
in the house is of course in in your
household there will be collectors which

47
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,480
collect all the information from the
meat rings

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,830
infrastructure and send it to the head
and

49
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,620
so that the head and is basically a
server which is located somewhere at the

50
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,670
distribution service operators

51
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,230
p.m. Sat and it will collect all
information

52
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,690
the head and could also be used as an
NDN is another

53
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,330
mobile device management but is rather a
meter device management

54
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,250
so they do updates in push configuration

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,019
out to two meters I'm in the middle part
in DeVaughn

56
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,050
the wide area network we usually see
TCPIP

57
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,180
or some some lets a power line protocol

58
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,269
custom-built what I will be speaking of
is a wireless metering protocols called

59
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:32,760
wireless

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,900
and bus and those days for me turbos

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,400
and is basically spoken at the

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,670
that the household part so the
neighborhood are your network

63
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:50,000
if I talk about the collector this is a
picture of one

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,209
so it's got I'm on that on the

65
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,830
had and side it's good TCPIP pluck

66
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,590
um is one also fits on top a real

67
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,890
so you could mmm basically use it

68
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,489
as an interface between the dumb meter

69
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,420
and the hat and so it collects
information from me to using various

70
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,780
protocols for example six-b_

71
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,090
I'm and sends it over heat from that

72
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,600
22 had and there's actually a

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,509
the a Linux running on this system
there's little web server as well so

74
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,860
I've not been digging into this device
if you wanna have some fun go for it

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,860
I'm sure there's lots of books this is a
piece of software which you could use to

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,550
configure subsystems huge

77
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,290
see just an overview how many meters are
actually talking to data collector

78
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,780
and what they are talking to it

79
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,860
that a meter so it

80
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,050
to special mediator is a can strip
electricity meter

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,039
you can basically plug any sort of
communication

82
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,060
PCB on it so there P cities for sick

83
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,210
be for awhile assembles for GPRS

84
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,880
and its plug-and-play sorry you choose
you choose the interface you want it to

85
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
look to correct PCB on it

86
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,919
and you're ready

87
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,120
what you could do nowadays with such
meters issue could for example

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,600
enforce payment so people who are not
timely

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,710
paying their bills could being forced to
pay day your energy consumption

90
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,720
in advance prepayment

91
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,660
you could also actually tell tell
customers but

92
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,210
terrorists are currently but you could
also disconnect someone

93
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:56,210
if he decides not to pay for energy
anymore

94
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:02,240
if we look at the protocol they are
talking so

95
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,660
to collectors basically receiving
information and Dimitris using

96
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,780
the protocol to talk to the collector

97
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,220
on it's basically used

98
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,259
all over Europe I have seen on many many
devices

99
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:25,110
around the US their should be about 15
million devices deployed no

100
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,150
arm

101
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,940
and you could use it for various topics

102
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,169
it's all standardized so it's an and I E
C E

103
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,500
and/or see European or you will get the
standards

104
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,449
from your favorite diesel store I have
been looking at the draft standards

105
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,600
actually because

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,120
the current standards the active
standards

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,259
they don't include any security tool

108
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,520
so I've been looking at the draft want

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,530
when we look at the protocol among
European mainly

110
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,400
see them talking about 800 a 68
megahertz

111
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,990
director lee also from some devices
which are using 169 making its

112
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,759
under 269 regrets you can up make up
2.5%

113
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,949
mines line-of-sight

114
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,569
the you some some easy line coding

115
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:25,599
and there's some sort

116
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,960
protocol packaging like we

117
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,970
know from TCP IP so they have a free
matter

118
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,669
they do some CRC there to detect for

119
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:39,870
something to for answers for example
there's the device addressing so if the

120
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,699
meter sends a packet

121
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,080
then it's gonna tell its own address the
coast

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,080
the the collector must somehow know
which meter actually sent information

123
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,300
there's also were a part of this petty
cash in business

124
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,300
which is called the extended link layer
I'm which this also implies some CRC's

125
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,220
if you look at the actual code then

126
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,180
there's a bite which indicates the
length of the whole message

127
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,599
then there will be information on
manufacturer

128
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,680
and the address of Demeter that the
information is being

129
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,759
sent in plain text all over so if you
are

130
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,699
in woods I would say the two to three
hundred meters range you will get the

131
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,020
information from such

132
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,959
wireless device and it will basically
tell you who has built

133
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,360
the device and what exact

134
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,979
number returns it will also tell you hi
I'm a water meter and the gas meter I'm

135
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,769
in electricity meter and what version it
has

136
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,500
so all we need from so if there would be

137
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,709
an issue in time with this device

138
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,080
you would easily find one ruble devices

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,990
and here we have to first issue
information disclosure

140
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,620
that's what we see in the Internet so
not to disclose

141
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,290
server versions over type

142
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,610
thats what they're doing here

143
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,050
to go for dinner there is a it's called
a day to Hatter

144
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,060
there are three different types of bait
hurt us there's no had a

145
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,760
but this if you if you ever come across
a packet which has no have it is bad

146
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,500
because

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,560
there's no encryption if you have a
shorter than you can signal encryption

148
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,800
if you can if there is a long Hatter and
you could also use it to some sort of

149
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,620
if you're familiar with TCP IP some sort
of not

150
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,290
so you can signal to a collector

151
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:52,290
to be kind of a gateway for some water
meter

152
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,110
if you look at the data Hatter there's a
nexus number

153
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,390
its the p3 here there's a Status field
and there's the configuration feel the

154
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,070
configuration field actually signals
that corruption

155
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,250
type you are using I'm in this case it's
a yes

156
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,680
128 CBC mode and it also say

157
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,089
is the 10x so means basically there's a
single block

158
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,410
a yes encrypt is attached so if you're

159
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:28,410
patient enough to to count the numbers
to gonna be 16 bytes there

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,610
but we don't have sufficient replay
prevention

161
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,990
because the axis numbers basically
telling the receiver

162
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,140
um which number of a message it was

163
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,950
period but if your gonna send

164
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,170
a 255 messages

165
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,720
and the same from access number will
occur

166
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,100
and these meters are configured to send
their well use

167
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,720
some do it every 10 seconds some do it

168
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,100
every minute so it's very likely that
these numbers will just

169
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,260
turnover and start over

170
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,430
if you look at the data they are
carrying I'm

171
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,149
it's very structured so and

172
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,050
there's there are informations of what
what data they are carrying

173
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,050
and what the value for miss this example

174
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,370
shows you basically minutes telling Andy

175
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,529
collector aid mmm I am

176
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,519
a data package which is the current
measurement

177
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,970
and by the way too well you I'm sending
you is an

178
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,550
in what hours and

179
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,290
than the actual value which is three
thousand

180
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,990
341 kilowatt-hours

181
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,560
its kinda difficult to find us open
source me for so I decided to little

182
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,399
to implement a little tightens grip you
could use this little heighten script

183
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:05,889
with

184
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,639
some sort of special hardware mmm

185
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,529
and I just used it to get some overview
on what they are really sending around

186
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:22,230
than I figured okays lots lot of the
vendors are using encryption

187
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,560
I dictating to the standard understand
it clearly states

188
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,370
at least eight bytes of the key shell be
different for each meter

189
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,670
but when just don't care they use the
same keys all over and over for

190
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,870
thousands

191
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,680
of the meters and the reason why what
they're doing is

192
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,360
they explained me you know there's two
technician we're gonna send him with a

193
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,829
handheld device

194
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,589
out to two houses and he's got to
reconvene urine to manage those devices

195
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,700
and we don't want him to hassle with all
the keys

196
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,839
okay so they have to say in key for all
day the wisest by the time one of these

197
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:01,870
guys

198
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:08,680
just loses his team his hand held device
they're lost

199
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,680
so we have in on key is stupid key isn't
right keys

200
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,120
then I went on and Todd most thinking
about okay

201
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,339
what what encryption modes are available
here I'm

202
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,160
and into standard are basically six
modes

203
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,089
mmm than a so okay there's still this
I'm gonna skip that

204
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,110
because makes no sense to have close
look at it

205
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,190
and there's also Christian that the
extended link layer

206
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,889
to use their account removed and ended

207
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,250
the dedicated educational uses CBC

208
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,430
server a yes should be fine right so
every me to render basically it works on

209
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,510
its website ok cool AES encryption
protects you

210
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,779
from fraud if you're using de meterse

211
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,310
it's not why

212
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,329
um it's a yes

213
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:11,440
in CBC the use in all Siro I we

214
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,810
and if you use in all Syrian

215
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,839
then every message

216
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
basically up

217
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,920
every message that contains the same
content will basically

218
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,970
and in the same cipher text so

219
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,630
if you say okay we're gonna consume 10
kilowatt hours

220
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,790
when you apply dile nothing

221
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,000
and there's a static key that's the
issue body I really would however you

222
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,940
wanna turn it

223
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,630
don't forget the cipher text block

224
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,029
and if you're not at home you're not
using any energy

225
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,260
right know much

226
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,510
so it still 10 kilowatt hours it's still
the same I went through the same keys

227
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,920
mmm turns out it's the same cipher text
block

228
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,300
so when you when you try to figure out
whether someone is at home or not

229
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,880
just be patient enough and wait for a
few packets and see whether they are

230
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,279
still

231
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,540
always the same I mean during trip that
you don't get

232
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,199
any clue what what's in there but if
they are just sayin

233
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,220
then you can basically concluded that
there is no one at home because they're

234
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:30,220
not using any energy

235
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:34,910
but they were pretty clever they
mandated to prefix the rally with the

236
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,639
date and time record

237
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,899
and if you flip through the standard you
will come across the date and time

238
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:41,970
record

239
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,949
unfortunately that day and time rectus
just minutes

240
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:50,559
and if you meet there is gonna send you
information every 10 seconds you're lost

241
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,749
so it doesn't help

242
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:58,809
there are more actually but you must
figure it yourself

243
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:04,299
procaine

244
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:07,769
let's give motive I for trial arm

245
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,499
what they're doing there is they still
this still use a

246
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:16,129
yesen CBC mode but they're not using

247
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,529
the a non-zero I V so

248
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,479
to analyze it we basically must have a
look at the Ivy construction

249
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:30,889
I'm they take the IB from the
manufacturer

250
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:37,889
this is a good idea now it's probably
not changing over the lifetime over the

251
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:39,769
meter

252
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:44,669
its mmm not any better so there is the
address of Demeter

253
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:50,039
as this is the serial number of to me to
usually doesn't doesn't change a tire

254
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,429
the only thing that changes is the
access number so every package should

255
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:54,909
have

256
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:58,889
another net access number actually
should be incremented

257
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:02,639
solar let's see

258
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,490
what happens I mean its 255

259
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,419
values so if you meter sensor
information every 10 seconds

260
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:15,569
the access number will roll over after
para about the forty-five minutes

261
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,110
and we have to same packets again so we

262
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,189
just arm be captain of patient and

263
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,179
way to forty-five minutes and you should
be easily able to determine whether

264
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,370
someone is at home

265
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,899
thereafter

266
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,450
okay last but not least we still have
tears and corruption mod-01

267
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,539
a the link layer its count remote

268
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,090
the issue with counter mode is

269
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,100
if some at some point the

270
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,409
initialization back to repeats you

271
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:54,549
you could get some plain text out of it
so

272
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,940
what you do basically is

273
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,119
arm you calculate well in Tripoli I

274
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,269
we and X or eat with the plaintext

275
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:09,320
and if you use the same I V you could
basically do this meant to magic

276
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,539
and this is an example of it so we do
have a plain text of

277
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm an actual packet of 341 kilowatt
hours under three hundred forty one in

278
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,970
12

279
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,940
kilowatt-hours and the difference of
these two plain text X

280
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,250
is born c and if

281
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,820
they have been initialized the same way
with the same I read a stream stand

282
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,330
you basically up can capture to site for
texts and if you saw room together you

283
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,330
get all so different so fluency

284
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,769
know what we're gonna do with this one
sees we figure how much different could

285
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:46,529
actually

286
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:50,019
difference could actually be so will try
to find

287
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,730
the the never first pair

288
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,110
and two to most by the way pair so and

289
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,809
this tells us basically d consumption
must have changed between

290
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:08,809
for what hours and 28 what hours is this
an issue

291
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,360
I mean if you buy shares from a company

292
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,620
it would be good to know whether they
have some

293
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,950
we know Las whether they're better under
way or not

294
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,860
so you must and necessarily know how
much energy they used it sufficiently

295
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,030
futures recognize the use more energy
less energy

296
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,660
because this basically tells you they
are more efficient or less efficient

297
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,700
hopefully okay but

298
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,360
to basically answer the question whether
we could use it as an attack or not we

299
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,610
need to answer to question whether we
could

300
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,900
make the Ivy to repeat or not and for
that purpose we need to have a look at

301
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,940
the idea again

302
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,580
um it's built from some static open and
sodium and effector ID doesn't change

303
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,870
the address doesn't change

304
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,950
and there's a signal communication
doesn't change much and

305
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,660
there is a and field which signals the
session counter and

306
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,460
it has a time field so is one is one is
gonna change

307
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,930
is one is pretty predictable and

308
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,320
is one is also pretty predictable on

309
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,330
so it's difficult it seems as I please
don't repeat

310
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,650
so would mean I couldn't I couldn't
actually run the attack I had in mind

311
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,260
I'm by the way if you can't predict the
Ivy Inc out to mod

312
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,750
and your security FTAs

313
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,860
128 it is reduced to 85 its

314
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,430
still enough today you know tomorrow

315
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,780
however so if we can get the time to
repeat somehow

316
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,250
arm we can get the IB to repeat

317
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,580
that's the bottom line here and

318
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:08,090
if you want to get to time to repeat in
the me to we must somehow figure but we

319
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,120
could adjust the time of Dimitri

320
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,570
and for that purpose I was digging into
two special protocol so there are

321
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,940
special protocols for arms are or
supplication resets and there are clock

322
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,890
updates

323
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,370
and actually said

324
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,540
add and subtract from the clock

325
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,070
countered doesn't need an encryption

326
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,950
or authentication so we could actually

327
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,730
update to clock up such meet prevented
it is implemented

328
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:47,310
we have key stream repetition means we
could get information from the

329
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,320
ciphertext

330
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,960
okay how about integrity so what does
happen

331
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,330
if I can money play packets and thrown

332
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,840
to meet or to the collector from

333
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,340
in general there just to mention and how
to

334
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,850
mmm implement deprecated authentication

335
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,210
from there is some mint refugee
protection

336
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,440
using the CRC's at the frame level and

337
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,800
they propose to use signatures for
consumption values but

338
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,540
actually I'm its a sentence or two a
mention in the standard

339
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,760
there are no max yet

340
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,840
so

341
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,460
basically means there is no integrity
protection so lets try to figure what we

342
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,470
could do because integrity protection is
absent

343
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,510
what we could try as we could

344
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,430
alter IV's because if we could alter and
I we

345
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,020
than we could basically many people ate

346
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,200
to plain text so it doesn't make much
sense to

347
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,080
to all to do any beat flipping on
decipher text in CBC

348
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,980
because if you take a trip to do just
get garbage a

349
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,760
but afterwards tive supplied to the 22

350
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,920
plain text there and so if you flip a
bit on the I read and it's directly

351
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,340
flipped into plain text

352
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,980
so can we do it

353
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,780
I'm the iris built from that part I'm

354
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,880
so if we manipulate that part and
actually the counterpart is receiving

355
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,390
the packet can find the correct key

356
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,950
so no good idea to manipulate over there

357
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,040
a version and type could be part of it

358
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,700
but um I wouldn't use diversion to

359
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,290
to actually look up two key because if
diversion up to me to changes

360
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:51,290
in bad idea and we could actually try to
many people eighty axis counter

361
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,320
which basically is an indicator for the
number of the message

362
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm if we do that we just destroyed a
trailing

363
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
the trailing to us which are used as a
padding for the packet

364
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,560
and but as the Wireless me to protocol
is built

365
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,220
with fixed-length where you basically
where you always tell

366
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,640
on the receiver how many bytes values
are being appended so they don't really

367
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,620
need to have a look at the trailing

368
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,880
2s so I don't think Canada La Perouse
going to have a look for it whether

369
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,200
these are well into two halves and

370
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,490
so there you could be able to manipulate
picture

371
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,510
and if devices share the same key so if
you flip the device address

372
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,810
and 2000 devices there have

373
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,250
narrow device addresses you could use it
actually forbid flippin because

374
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:49,250
if they have all the same address did
receive a bit still find the correct key

375
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,380
so I made an example

376
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,380
if we have an original value and we read
it actually from to me to display

377
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,440
through and 341 kilowatt-hours

378
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,590
and if we'd say okay up this is too much
for my bill

379
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,490
I'd rather prefer to pay less I'm

380
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,770
we can read the standard I B from the
pack it because this is not interrupted

381
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,790
and than the figure how much we're gonna
pay

382
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,050
and keep that in mind because we'll need

383
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,260
to manipulate the Ivy over there and

384
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,030
this will basically turned and the plain
text into to manipulate it plain text

385
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,840
so we have to cipher text block this is
the original cipher text being sent

386
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,500
2/2t collector and just that he will be
applied and here with slipped a bit

387
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,420
and diesel basically also cost to flip
to be trendy

388
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,660
plain text so

389
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,360
we basically flipped it's here

390
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,460
and this will turn numbers and will
finally have a hundred forty-four

391
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,150
kilowatt-hours so you with basically

392
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,390
cops our electricity bill into

393
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,740
whole you could do it the other way
around as well

394
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,650
so you could basically do it in
direction of Demeter so if you wanna

395
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,490
send

396
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,540
for example a comment to Demeter

397
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,230
I'm you could you could use this
technique as well

398
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,570
there's another issue from you could
basically

399
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,610
tell the receiver how many

400
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,910
the blocks are being appended which are
encrypted

401
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,520
and and a go and take this part the trip
did

402
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,470
but you could still up and more on a
trip that information

403
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,860
and some of you might have heard of a
HTTP

404
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,840
parameter pollution what I describe
years basically the same for the

405
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,070
protocol

406
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,200
so will what we do is we have

407
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,960
a standard encrypt it back at so its ace
the length of two packages money

408
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,490
and the the bold text is

409
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,980
the 16 bytes a single block yes in
cryptic message

410
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,950
what we do is we attach a plain text
standard value

411
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,130
a we actually have to adjust the first
bite because it's indicating to holing

412
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,490
tough to frame

413
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,690
we don't touch the encrypt apart at all

414
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,090
and we just append the plaintext so now
we've basically

415
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:36,440
depends on what the double up for dead
within the meter or within the collector

416
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,460
so if they take the first value which is
encrypt it or whether they used the

417
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,000
second will you

418
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,320
which is plain text in their algorithm

419
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,340
so I took basically to plain text and
appended

420
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:59,330
encrypt court

421
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,920
then had a look at the extended link
layer integrity protection

422
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,430
so they were pretty clever day used CRC
undated encrypt it actually

423
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,980
in hope no one would be able to
manipulate commands

424
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,720
what you see here is a common to switch
a meter on or off

425
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,320
the official two months oh and did
basically

426
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,900
you don't say the CRC of CC 22

427
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,830
there's little need to let's call it
revenge

428
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,010
arm which you could use to calculate

429
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,800
use your sis for reals polynomials

430
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,450
and what I did is I basically arm
calculated to

431
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,250
to CRC over this switch on come around
and i also calculated to CRC over to

432
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,790
switch off command which is

433
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,790
first one 47 and tenders metal

434
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,960
again a little meant to match XO you
basically want to send the of command

435
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,320
or you at least you want to let to me
just think it's enough command

436
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,010
will be intercepted this the first part
so the intercept cipher text

437
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,860
the first line we know how the on
command looks like

438
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,690
and what we do know is we have
calculated

439
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:23,690
the CCRC's over these two commands and
we do know some magic

440
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,730
we take decipher text sorry it with the

441
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:32,080
original plain text links are equipped
with actually what we would like to have

442
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,930
and we sent that cipher text to the
meter and its gonna switch off

443
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:41,600
there was never a need to know to key

444
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,600
not at all and all because there is no
integrity protection so this tells us

445
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,300
even in trip to CRC is just no use

446
00:29:53,300 --> 00:30:00,300
and there's no integrity protection at
other parts of the protocols well

447
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,540
so

448
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,750
time for them I'm its kinda difficult to
bring

449
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,960
meters and stuff when you arrive

450
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,130
biplane so I brought some

451
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:23,260
little sniffer devices that have to have
time to look into my computer

452
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,880
um there is a collector deweiss

453
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,980
which is actually a piece of software
running on my computer but behaving like

454
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,310
a real world

455
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:38,500
collector Andheri since the diff to me
today is little simulator deweiss

456
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,330
this is over here so if I switch it on

457
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,940
so it's on now

458
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,160
and it sends it's startling to
increments or sends an increment that

459
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,640
number it simulates a barter counter

460
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,640
but what I do know is basically used as
infrastructure to show you some attacks

461
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,440
so the meter is gonna send its
information to the collector

462
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,030
which is a piece of software on my
computer the

463
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,770
and I'm gonna send it to the sender the
US so to repeat information or to

464
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,180
manipulate it or whatever

465
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,450
I'm you could use those pics

466
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,790
there's also a little transmitter device

467
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,260
it's called the CC 1101

468
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,350
from TI a which you could use

469
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,730
but you could also use general purpose
radio equipment

470
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,850
there is a new radio project actually

471
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,740
you mustn't take photographs it's all
it's all on our block afterwards

472
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,790
and it's not just ask me I am

473
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,360
there's a canoe radio template for
wireless and this as well

474
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,980
okay so I do have a virtual machine

475
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,510
arm we do have piece of nifty sniffer
software again

476
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,970
it's all written in Google go the
problem

477
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,170
I start my

478
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,770
my device now so you see and

479
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:20,770
chips and status and information

480
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,059
welcome

481
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,850
yet here we are there's no such device
this is not very nice

482
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:43,850
better

483
00:32:56,499 --> 00:33:03,499
you know he's probably right I'm sorry
it's a bit difficult so if I plucked

484
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,259
them the wrong way

485
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:13,259
than you gonna go for coffee it's all
disconnected

486
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,600
you

487
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,600
one is here

488
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:48,980
you know the one as well

489
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,480
here we go

490
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,800
so it's sending you messages here it is

491
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,010
should be more or less right time the

492
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,490
there's a new popped in and you will see
some

493
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,860
some basic information so how long frame
is

494
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,120
the control byte what manufactory it is

495
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,780
so it is and for way less mmm

496
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,530
dandy I D and its gonna tell me hey I'm
a radio converter

497
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,340
actually it's a simulator usually you
see here whether it's a water meter gas

498
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,680
meter heat meter

499
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:39,710
whatever it is arm that's the access
number I told you

500
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,200
should be incremented yes and here's the
Ivy

501
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,290
computed and

502
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,970
there's not a device over here so that
this is the

503
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:57,030
emulation of the collectors so the one
who is collecting all the information

504
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,260
I you see here 2-meter sent us

505
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,850
the well you 600

506
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:11,500
84 over here and here's the key

507
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,160
for the device and if we

508
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,640
just run it again so it's counting up
alright

509
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,640
so we are with 687

510
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
what I do know is

511
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,830
just go to Disney for a

512
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:47,830
take one of the old packets so

513
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,070
just replay id

514
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,900
go to that once and

515
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,300
basically we sent in all the while you
an old well you too D

516
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,320
to the collector again it's just the
uterus repeated

517
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,670
the message again and he's gonna pick it
and takes it for granted

518
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:16,670
that's it

519
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,500
have another need them up

520
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,570
I told you there is there's a plain text

521
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,350
a pending issue and actually do i sry
assimilate over here

522
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,200
a behaves the wrong way in real world as
well

523
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,750
I'm but I can show you how you could a
key

524
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,610
is attacked with his little too so what
we're gonna take as

525
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,090
1 of 2 messages and you see here

526
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,640
it's called its gonna send information
it's called and the wireless

527
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,300
test mode you a will put something fancy
here

528
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,710
i'm for dat with me to do some

529
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:10,710
chick again so

530
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,170
choose to value you like

531
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:21,990
for example I like King Paris so we need
to reverse it and we need to have

532
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,340
the hacks numbers of it

533
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:32,340
you know

534
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:39,900
so

535
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,529
you see here is the the hex
representation of that string

536
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:48,619
and the first three bites are actually
indicating hey this is a string

537
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:51,770
some gonna pick that and I take an old
message

538
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,020
take an old message

539
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,130
I'm gonna pick to hey I'm string

540
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,380
I'm gonna pick divides who

541
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,069
you know put him over here

542
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:08,400
need to count 'em 12 sry

543
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,440
for 678 9 turned

544
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,720
11 12 13 should be OC right

545
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,250
no

546
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:24,970
be PC doesn't really matter and

547
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,599
wanted to let Julie does it just
suggests the frame linked

548
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,619
automatically I'm gonna send

549
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:38,619
that to

550
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:47,020
back in Paris

551
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:58,080
so but you may be recognized that just
stopped the

552
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,190
Demeter because in real world it
slightly

553
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,680
more difficult arm pictures

554
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,890
when I just send another well you to
meet a real stills and its original

555
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,530
value

556
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,040
few seconds after so what you need to do
is basically capture a packet

557
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,050
and somewhat Eder shields the meter or

558
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,330
take big hammer and break it and then
repeated

559
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:26,050
but it it's a little its kinda difficult
because

560
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,550
utilities to employ some sorta fraud
detection so

561
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,130
if you're energy bill just drops 10

562
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,120
be a you lost so what you need to do is
capture the

563
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,790
all the packets in time and just delay
them and send them

564
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,630
that's far better or you could also

565
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:51,010
figure what T actual delays between two
packets and jammed the packet and send

566
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,850
your own packets in between but make
sure you don't use my

567
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,750
more energy that you were actually
gaining okay

568
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,390
yeah so what would you do then go and
wardrobe so drop your devices capture

569
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,130
packets

570
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,600
or drive around install a big

571
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,540
sander makes a good picture for this
column

572
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,790
and then you're gonna send or repeat

573
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,630
to disconnect message just I'm yes make
sure

574
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:25,370
you bring flashlight it's gonna be dark
I tried to sum it up and I stumbled over

575
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,340
the company they basically

576
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,710
from specialized in violence and persons
relations wired and wireless

577
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,190
and their company name brings it pretty
much to the point

578
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:41,390
in so we have low key size Susa

579
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,810
silver consumption detection disclose of
consumption will use because

580
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:51,400
easily see a rose and alarms there's
information disclosure man in the middle

581
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,900
disclosure you could manipulate
consumption and you could also

582
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,120
organize for a black cat but

583
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,120
people have figured it as well the

584
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,800
published a new standard in January
busier

585
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,080
they have two new mod seven and 13

586
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,420
7 to some require some

587
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,540
integrity layer which does some CBC Mac
I guess

588
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,690
and the does rotate keys

589
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,450
it calculates Keystone anyplace so
should be pretty fine and they also

590
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,650
figure to pay we could use TLS

591
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,050
want to support for one assembles

592
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,240
so if you buy your enemy children please
call for this too

593
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,720
types of protocols that's it my battery
pack is empty

594
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,980
here
