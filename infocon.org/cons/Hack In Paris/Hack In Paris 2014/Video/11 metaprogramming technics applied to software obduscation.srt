1
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,780
up

2
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,450
like amid welcome everybody

3
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,330
a complete presentation about citrus
please

4
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,680
with the program and and a physician my
name is

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,450
the best and regret I'm so the families
activities

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,050
professionally are specialized in
reverse engineering

7
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,340
and doing or so some contest

8
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,870
especially on my nineteen nineties US
and Android

9
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,070
I'm doing or so some currency and

10
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm citrus whose the seashell objectives
to differ

11
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,000
since the beginning of this month I'm
working for a company called

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,130
SERT in Switzerland euros on

13
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,560
and SERT the organizer

14
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,620
of and some neck in geneva so I am
talking about

15
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,750
a position what is the problem I'm
supposed to I was supposed to make a

16
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,980
demonstration but

17
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,520
the you know that this isn't had some
problems with my

18
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,680
laptop so I record a video

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,680
sorry for that

20
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,430
and this is ida

21
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,890
I the is a brosser the best

22
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,280
the the compiler and disassembler and

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,260
opening I the and the US a petition it's
an agent from

24
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,500
amo by management system well-known

25
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,010
move and device management system and
the

26
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,690
and my body as management systems miles
out to

27
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,950
in falls company policies and in this
case is

28
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,690
rate and false the it makes Jedburgh
detection

29
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,480
and enforce as a integrity of the device

30
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,720
and I we show you I would too find

31
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,980
the gazer called responsible for this
detection so I was dotted with you

32
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,640
so this is I then

33
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,680
and ourselves for a stranger the
stringer we looking for

34
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,790
we look for Jesus in John said is

35
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,240
well-known just that we do here a singer
is a well-known

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,190
the equivalent of the Apple App Store

37
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,260
on Plaza jailbreak market

38
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,770
and the the ideal is to

39
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,680
instead of compiling and try to
understand the war

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,160
a gentle application I will just tried
to find

41
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,290
where this trend is used so

42
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,830
I find as a stranger

43
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,530
and we'll in and we look for

44
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,760
cross-references so code which is using
this train

45
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,000
so no I ever and as a stranger and
objected

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,390
stringed and I find very quickly the
code

47
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,540
responsible to detect if the devices
jailbroken on that

48
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,770
I can even use a Decompiler

49
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,590
and we not get objective-c code but
something which is close to seek or the

50
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,300
and you see a a list of three innings

51
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,450
I'm and a little bit

52
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,800
later lucie fire exist

53
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,970
at bus so this application is

54
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,100
just looking for a list updated list of
five

55
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,270
and if the fire one of the times exists
between suppose that

56
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,220
devices jailbroken it's very easy to
patch

57
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,390
this function to always return false and
then you can resign

58
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,780
the binary reinstall on your device and
you are

59
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,020
a device which is it jailbroken and
which seems to be compliant

60
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,550
for the MDM and this is exactly the
situation

61
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,169
I wanted to avoid it's too easy to find
this kind

62
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,650
of of court and I wanted to

63
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,010
make something and 1up's when

64
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,010
solution is execution

65
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,310
so what is the position I'm

66
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,650
if you take a softer an application in

67
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,800
for example in this case a petition will
be called Katy Perry

68
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,360
and ewing you

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,650
you havin not his Gator who which is
like a

70
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,750
mathematical function and your bride

71
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,370
these up his data to kitty purry and

72
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,470
you get and as the kitty purry it's
still Katy Perry

73
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,639
it's really the ferry

74
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,669
it does almost the same scientists
antics I was the same side effects

75
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,949
drops it's a little bit slower or thing
like that

76
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,740
and its obfuscated in a more for more

77
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,400
way a physician is that'd be raped

78
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,409
acts of creating source code or

79
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,280
mention code difficult for you meant to
understand

80
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,810
and implies that it's not difficult for

81
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,949
mission to understand and to execute

82
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,020
there are different classes

83
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,380
up his Gator you can transform the
source code

84
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,960
and you can transform the binary code it
corresponds smallest

85
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,639
to use a different faces up for a
compiler between the front and on the

86
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,219
back end

87
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,250
and insides the

88
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,020
filth class source code transformation

89
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,539
you can manually make your physician but
it's a difficult to manage

90
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:41,360
though it's difficult to debug the
application you can

91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,159
use a preprocessor you automates the

92
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,539
for example for for strings liter rolls
to a first date

93
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,419
increased between the two rows you can
tried to make her

94
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,539
least and your property the person so
we'll replace

95
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:03,400
each string by and as a 1x the truck but
it's not very easy to manage

96
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,729
and it's very difficult for the
developer to

97
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,969
to be back and you have or so

98
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,979
obstruction textfree up his day terms

99
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,909
in when you compile you depend

100
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,370
the language but normally when you
combine source code

101
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,940
it generates an intermediate
representation the source code which is

102
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,630
independent of the platform

103
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,409
and you can office Kate called

104
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,900
at this label and for some languages you
are more

105
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,640
faces more possibilities and sickness
because

106
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,380
is a case UFC crispers template

107
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,400
instantiation and I will use that

108
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,040
for visitation and be from

109
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,370
going into an implementation I we'll
explain a little bit what is

110
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,800
business templates if I take an example

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,480
love like object a monk to

112
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,920
develop a class some codes to represent

113
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,990
such a like a project you off

114
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,650
two methods Bush to push and not an
object on the top

115
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,180
up the stack and your fbook

116
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,670
to remove the object on the top of the
stack

117
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,760
so if I try to

118
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,250
to make a class represent against thanks

119
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,560
the stack of anything and

120
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,070
I have I'm declaring my class with
strict

121
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,709
its almost original enterprise and

122
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,870
and they have to miss it push and pop
and you need

123
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,980
to pass as Burma to the objects and

124
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,180
I'm want to make only one implementation
so I have to accept

125
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,790
anything so I put to avoid went up a
break point is a point

126
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,430
to anything and to use my stack

127
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,650
simple for example instantiate

128
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,779
in a cloth coursing deals

129
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,310
senior and with this in the valuable

130
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,540
called witness beals I can push Britain
is built on the stack

131
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,800
and letter in my coat I can retrieve

132
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,140
this object canned corn method %uh

133
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,649
singer a single sink and it's working

134
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:21,649
because investors the singer is
Britain's if I take an exam

135
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,459
example this time I is done she ate an
able

136
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,490
and I put my a poor on the stack on the
same stretch

137
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,120
it's possible because I'm accepting
anything

138
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,860
and letter in my code I'll pop

139
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,089
is a objects and I

140
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,420
good this in valuable Justin

141
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,480
and it's a a single

142
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,010
and I can call sink on my object

143
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,540
because a single usable to sing but
between not

144
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,949
not rocket require show it to you

145
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,500
beer very strangely because in this case

146
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,890
I have in a poll I don't have a singer

147
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,329
this is exactly

148
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,610
I'm why year the dismissed employees

149
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,880
have been design its to avoid this kind
of situation

150
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,240
to the goal is to have only one
implementation

151
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,520
which is which you can apply to

152
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,829
in the object but mistype safety

153
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,900
so instead of declaring avoid pointer

154
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,670
as parameter you declare a template for
that name

155
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,069
call T you can with any name

156
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,110
that convention is to put as a

157
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,930
on the 1-liter and in Purkis

158
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,980
and to replace your VoIP by T and this
time

159
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,420
if I tried to bush and the poor

160
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,610
on the stack up singer I we love a
compilation

161
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,880
iraq not a runtime error on the crash

162
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,589
have a compilation error

163
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,170
so different kinds of templates invis
presentation that we for cues on class

164
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,689
templates

165
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,839
and uses that you declare template with
the syntax

166
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,260
you type template and angle

167
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,760
brackets and you have a list of prime it
does

168
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,980
you can put types wheeze as a privilege
tightening or class its

169
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,079
exactly the same are you can

170
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,569
integral types like into girls shorts

171
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,760
long enumerations exit row it's not
working with his

172
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,089
double in float because I'm not into
group

173
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,760
and data in the integral types

174
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,290
you can also put point earl's and
references

175
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,040
and you cannot to passed as a parameter
on Nov

176
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,650
templates you have a template of a
template

177
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:57,990
its some times use but it's not very
often

178
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,800
I was given an example up for class is
an integral

179
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,500
perimeter for example I'm trying to
represent

180
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,620
the Fibonacci sequence at compile-time
not

181
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,959
at runtime: at compile-time so if you
can achieve

182
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,130
sequences related to the gold number and

183
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,410
thing like that is simply the sum
observe previews

184
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,399
to number to two items in the sequence

185
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,399
and if I tried to represents biz

186
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,160
weasel zippers please templates I'm
declaring

187
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,029
stricter a class goldman et Cie and

188
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:41,279
I'm I have and an end to go which is
called value in this case is

189
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,680
and value is simply the sum up reviews

190
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,250
to items in the sequence and

191
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,360
and to reference

192
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,790
to to compute biz

193
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,139
items I'm referencing to the same

194
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,050
template so it's a reclusive template
and the recursion

195
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,350
us to stop somewhere so I'm the crowing
after

196
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,480
to special values for 1&0 reserve value
10

197
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,540
and and this way when that instantiates

198
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,579
for example to Wenatchee for to any

199
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:24,250
and it will iterated it's not in
addition but it's a recursion a tweet

200
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,320
rituals in instance that templates for

201
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,899
the different values and it will stop
with

202
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,430
value one n0 and if a luchar out what I
am

203
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,070
in in the binary I will on the the
result

204
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,220
everything is made at compile-time is
there

205
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,790
very different from decoration which is
a no more function

206
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,839
its most important but its own normal
function

207
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,720
and this

208
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,830
function is evaluated at runtime:

209
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,120
so the compiler would generate code for
them

210
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,650
and what is in in red arrange

211
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,330
is evaluated compact I'm knows the Pew

212
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,660
nothing everything is at rent
compile-time

213
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,430
so missus what is called met %uh
programs

214
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,420
you able to manipulates

215
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,060
the compiler the citrus this compiler to
generates

216
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,190
too many both types to generate programs

217
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,420
mean its return with a subset

218
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,830
upset was because its but completely
part of the stand-up

219
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,410
it was proven to be touring compatible

220
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,610
and it's very close to functional
programming

221
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,240
for example you don't have the loops you
see

222
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,400
in the producer example you have to use

223
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,780
rich ocean to mid to emulate sloops

224
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,590
and

225
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,220
will know you sure you felt
implementation

226
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,760
in the more to do assure you

227
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,910
at the beginning you see that is very
easy

228
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,020
to find some code I'm

229
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,330
weasel strings you just follow who is
using

230
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,200
a given string and you find

231
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,760
interesting called and like I said it's

232
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,709
what they want to avoid and this is some

233
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,290
some

234
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,639
to say that this is my goal

235
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,339
with my implementation I wanted to
observe the strings all regional strange

236
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:34,579
in the source code otherwise it's too
difficult to manage

237
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,819
and that would be back original string

238
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:42,630
us to be in the debug builds both as to
disappear completely from

239
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,829
willie's fields and I will show you how
to

240
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:50,329
implement his with met up running so

241
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,380
this is Affeldt implementation I will
describe

242
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,730
which line so I'm dickering

243
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,540
class this construct thats like this a
class

244
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,589
as the differences as everything is the
village

245
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,789
and it's called with a strained

246
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:10,610
one because it's a perception and my
best friend it's just to store my

247
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,179
obfuscated between and

248
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,140
the second line is a constrictor and
with the Prime Minister

249
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,470
which is my original strange I need to
stall the office stated

250
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,909
string some way up so I declare above
before characters

251
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,400
we will see the links after and

252
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,490
in michael's Twitter I have to feel
these but for

253
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,610
so I'm declaring side

254
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,740
the better it will be field reason the
values which I'm

255
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,320
which I after also braces and

256
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,240
what they want is to encrypt each
character some

257
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,150
I'm taking my string mosier original
string which is as Joe

258
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,180
and af2 take

259
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,190
each director if I am just

260
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,160
if I take an example if I of three
characters

261
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,860
what Anita is with my kids the is a
character a position

262
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,930
0 than position 1 and for

263
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,720
each case is I have to call encrypt and

264
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,540
I don't know in advance the length of my
strength to walk

265
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,000
Res in the spring and dealings so

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,770
I will use what is called a value-added
templates just put three dots

267
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,880
after the in in the means the template

268
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,720
and then I'm using the three thats

269
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,940
in the constructor and the combine over
judge replace

270
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,360
this three dots I'm

271
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,420
Res each index I have

272
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,400
and in May templates so I will call

273
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,090
my templates with a list of index zero
one two three et cetera

274
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,140
and the combine our jobs iterates

275
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,260
these in list of index and we'll replace

276
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:08,790
those retards by this cold I have also
another operator which is

277
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,350
sizeof with three thats and it will give

278
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,510
me is

279
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,650
%uh the links size of my list of indexes

280
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,950
and put because one

281
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,950
because I want to put and will bite at
the end I ever and encrypts

282
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,290
function in the crib complexion member
in this case it's just an example

283
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm doing XO with up could add value and
since

284
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,100
is XO the decryption exe exactly the
same

285
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,000
and everything in blue

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,600
is evaluated at campaign time so the
compiler

287
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,950
real take much strain will extract at
compile-time each character will encrypt

288
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,740
each character and restores a result and

289
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,530
I need to decreases at one time so I'm
just the crowing

290
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,590
the crips implementation of the cutest
rural it's just a loop

291
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,840
and I just have to call the crypt for
each character

292
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,840
and to use this trend

293
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,380
him declaring to my crew and you see a
list of index

294
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,760
and I'm so it will create

295
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,890
an instance of this class Res the

296
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,190
origin is to bring and than called
eclipse

297
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,440
so everything is will be the

298
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,660
evaluated at compile-time accepts
decryption

299
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,540
and to use my strange just

300
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,870
with this kind of pressure except as
stated one and my

301
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,800
original story however

302
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,830
a more Parham who is this implementation

303
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,300
like to see list of indexes ok good

304
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,030
and I have a string which is longer it
would be truncated

305
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,500
and if the

306
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,760
this trend is shorter depending on the
compiler

307
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,960
you could produce very strange things so
have to enhance

308
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,350
my implementation it what they need is
to be able to generate

309
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,620
at compile-time alleged of indexes with
a future version

310
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,620
up to disperse it will be possible it
will be part of the standout it's called

311
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,130
index

312
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,460
sequence but unfortunately it's a future
that's enough for the Spurs

313
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,600
and needs to use compiled of today

314
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,430
so have implemented myself very
simplified version

315
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,200
up

316
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,890
I'm this template I will not explain how
it works because it's a

317
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,290
little bit complicated met what is
important is a result

318
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,290
defined call make index

319
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,810
bees prometo in to in the

320
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,030
Intego and I retrieve the Thai that

321
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,220
I get template called indexes

322
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,410
and the perimeter of indexes Mike
sequence

323
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,080
of number so in my first implementation

324
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,540
I can replace Soliz up with at least

325
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,870
of into girls by this make index and it
works

326
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,060
but I still

327
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,370
some limitation in my

328
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,990
implementation because as you see

329
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:36,990
suan the keys accorded what they want is
to be able to generate a different key

330
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,800
for it strange and if possible also for
each computation

331
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,950
and to be able

332
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,020
to do that I just adding the new
perimeter to make them critical

333
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,220
kid and I have

334
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,580
meet the strings 3 and

335
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,600
I need to generate at compile-time

336
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,490
so the run them number rose or random
numbers

337
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,270
to simplify so have created I know as a
template

338
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,630
which is called mitterand them we're not
going to the detailed

339
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,000
up that it's not very complicated to
implement

340
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,720
in this case is its implementing lean
our congressional

341
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,690
in Jain I'm it's not a uniform
distribution because

342
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,670
it's not so easy at compile-time to make
sure you need from the solution

343
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,390
and it's not very important in this case
think it's not very important

344
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,770
so there's a plus is very small in this
case

345
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,000
and it's a recursive template

346
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,400
so to use met at random you but

347
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,900
and you have a maximum for example you
want to generate a number between 0 and

348
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,860
the five

349
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,370
you re you will be put six for

350
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,260
in because you generates a random number
in the third

351
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,850
of 6 the possibility and to

352
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,960
gets a first random number you just call

353
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,390
the template wheeze and

354
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,570
equal 0 excedrin and

355
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,450
in the case %uh means a when

356
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,910
the and is a0 I need to see the

357
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,370
it's not are true random number
generator

358
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,230
it's absurd around and number generator
also I need to see it

359
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,250
and see those to be different for

360
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,170
its completion and you have on the a few
possibilities inside this place

361
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,740
I'm at this time find these
possibilities

362
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,960
its to use to micros which to

363
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,110
predefined macros we one which is
standard

364
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,290
its the time the computation time and
the second one

365
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,690
which is called canto it's not stand a
lot but its

366
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,700
implemented by the majority of
competitors

367
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,580
it was

368
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,150
felt introduced by Microsoft I remember
well

369
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,540
come to you love when you call on

370
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,080
when you instantiates when you

371
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,710
refrains fourth time can tell you up
zero and when you

372
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,750
we france is the second time you off one
exit right succumb to

373
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,740
so

374
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,870
thanks to time I we love I can generate

375
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,990
different his voyage compilation and
thanks to canter

376
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,990
I can generate different keys from each
strange string literal so

377
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,100
I have almost the perfect solution but
why not go further

378
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,620
in what you see in this example

379
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,870
my in my careerism

380
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,230
to encrypt is always the same its just
60

381
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,909
but why did not using different a reason

382
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:52,279
for which three Inc and for each
compilation

383
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,649
and it's possible with exactly the same
principle

384
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:59,490
some I am introducing and as a permit to

385
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,039
call a and we lose what you want is cool

386
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,330
templates special and bus rolled

387
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,389
specialization I will make an
implementation for

388
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:14,850
special value of be so

389
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,070
my first implementation you will is when

390
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,100
is equal to 0 and the second one will

391
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,059
when it is equal to 1 exit row in be

392
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,870
example

393
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,890
i've only three implementations but you
can imagine

394
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,210
a lot of different implementations in to
use

395
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,770
to choose around them a reason

396
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,990
just for using to gain mitterand them in
this case is

397
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,380
only to possibilities to different to

398
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,940
a reason so I have value to a bit you
can

399
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,950
implement the number you want and

400
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,730
this is my called without a physician

401
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,830
and Michael with opposition so its

402
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,470
the sin taxes not so nice but

403
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,550
it's not too widely and I will

404
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,720
show you and as a result again I was
supposed to

405
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,260
do that in life reside at unfortunately

406
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,410
I was not able to use my laptop so

407
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,950
I would just show you some gunships mmm

408
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,220
so this is the original implementation

409
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,320
and you see original strain witness
bills

410
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,620
and this is with the Cleveland after my

411
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,220
encryption perhaps it's not

412
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,280
burial just two to see but and

413
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,880
I have a mix of instructions move

414
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,470
and a office stated values because it's

415
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,280
generated started by by the compiler in
May implementation I have in the red

416
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,200
%uh correct earl's but its optimized by
the compiler

417
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,170
and as a result you have a mix so

418
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,630
in my binary I don't have the original
string

419
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,690
but I don't so was a if his dad that
string

420
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,310
it's mixed with inspections and

421
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,740
then I have felt lucky and this is a
decryption

422
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,570
so it's very small because my
implementation it's very simple

423
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,210
in protection caught its

424
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,750
not but to have something which is
simple because you are introducing

425
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,200
some computer vision which are not part
of the original program

426
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,220
so you have to find

427
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,830
a good balance between complexity in
speed

428
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,679
I was and show you

429
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,530
quickly a second application love this
principle

430
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,740
and my goal in this case is

431
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,309
up is Kate's calls I have a function

432
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,100
in in this function I want to call
another one which is called in this case

433
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,630
production to protect

434
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,790
and one to protective is

435
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,960
against static and that is and

436
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,160
even dynamical analysis of course

437
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,770
it's not perfect what I want is to slow
down

438
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:18,000
reveals engineering father

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,860
I will use if in its its mission
principal

440
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,710
is to generate lot of court complicated
called

441
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,780
and difficult to follow I have a very
simple

442
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,190
units that mission in this case is in
production

443
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,919
it will be more complex and might entry
point to be president

444
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,900
as a the core at the source and

445
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,590
in my example financed it represents

446
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,480
call in the target and in the middle I'm
generating

447
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,200
the compiler regenerate a lot of called
to do that

448
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm using mmm library from boost

449
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,380
boost is a collection because libraries
and CR

450
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,610
library which is government usted
mission

451
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,260
and and a growing simply

452
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,650
transition table its

453
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,740
the it's still sit whispers and it's
completely

454
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,080
evaluated at compile-time so the
compiler will use these

455
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,140
state this transition table

456
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,780
and with that it will generate code to
implement

457
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:41,280
a finished its mission I'm

458
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,480
things like stated or evens are classes

459
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,590
I'm not values so no meaning

460
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,040
at runtime meaning only and

461
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,320
to compile time and to

462
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,440
use my

463
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,780
obfuscated column again I have
introduced

464
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,870
my crew and normally you cool

465
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,730
the thing show nude pipes and the man's
attention you put the parent is

466
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,929
parent is and you have the permit earl's
with my office did

467
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,200
confiscated call you up to with his
press leaks

468
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,030
obviously did call and the name of the
function is the first permit

469
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,880
no what is a lot like you function so
the syntax

470
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,610
is not so nyse: but its in my point of
view it's not

471
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,820
to likely and if you want to combine

472
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,840
the position up the call and the
opposition

473
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,809
the permit earl's you off last and

474
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:46,400
last line so I'm

475
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,470
this is a cordon result a physician you

476
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,720
simply I'm you do in this case you don't
have a %uh natural call

477
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,240
it's a gem because it was optimize buys
a compiler

478
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,450
but its agreement and

479
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,080
if I take for example %uh my obfuscated

480
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,610
call its on the a small subset

481
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,830
of the court generated by is a
complainer inmate implementation

482
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,060
I have even this gated address

483
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,500
up the target because in I W C's that's
it's very

484
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,690
is the I days able to compute cause
cross

485
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,710
references so unify us the address

486
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,330
somewhere it will find it and I will

487
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,560
and we'll be able to make static
analysis and no

488
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,720
who is actually calling distinctions so
I of his cage

489
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,110
its simply a shift ups is a value

490
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:48,770
and using the same

491
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,020
principles it's possible to go even
further

492
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,380
like I said I

493
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,830
office stated the the address

494
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,420
up the target and it's possible also to
use several

495
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,790
different minute state machines its
exactly the same thing

496
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,510
like for the met us to enforce those
between confiscation

497
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,590
I can define a set of units that machine
and

498
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,200
at compile-time the compiler which was
one randomly

499
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,480
and the you can imagine that it becomes

500
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,130
more complex for realz be able to
reverse

501
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,620
it's still possible but it's far more
complex

502
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,090
and something which is interesting
reason is to missions

503
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,820
is that you can combine transitions
wheeze

504
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,790
values like

505
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:45,220
in like typical detection all get on
mission

506
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,410
the texan so home in

507
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,210
in a transition when you execute the
business that mission

508
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,650
if it detects that the burger for
example is running

509
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,510
it we follow a different bus the finish
that mission

510
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,510
and in you can into a loop

511
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:08,230
infinite loop for example or something
like that some

512
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,770
world about compilers supports and what
I've implemented

513
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,640
its well supported by people LVN

514
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,330
concealing evens latest

515
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,250
version it's when she belted bison
regulars and no more

516
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,320
alleged p.m. it also supported widget
with gcc

517
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,350
and spit interim service plus compiler

518
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,840
for internalize things that you have to
lose

519
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,430
later this chin unfortunately it's not
supported with

520
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,400
measures to do because as a is yours to
do is not supporting whale

521
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,340
cyberspace 11 serve lot of difficulties
to implement

522
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,650
constant expression expression which are
evaluated

523
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:57,020
at compile-time only and it's an old
compiler

524
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,130
and parent results some difficulties

525
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,550
even in the latest latest fashion

526
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,100
Technical Preview 1 it's still not
working

527
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,839
I think it's possible to change my
called

528
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,890
and to in to port is to

529
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,000
visuals to do but it will become very

530
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,190
a Glee it we know more cities because

531
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,240
11 and did not have the time

532
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,000
and me emerges I was using

533
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,460
people a VM so just do is not so
important for me in this case

534
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,730
and you have to be careful with you

535
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:42,610
compiler options because if you are not
paying attention

536
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,140
as a combined 0 me generate some

537
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,550
the book called in into the because you
love the original string for example

538
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,780
so it's important to use in rallies so
the right

539
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,460
options religious issues you

540
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,420
it's not said dispersal even by default
your to specify

541
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,960
his on the command line and you have to
use

542
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,170
optimization function I think that I
have a mistake

543
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,300
its not its its minutes its

544
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,660
for Xcode just have to

545
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,250
change the deployment papers things
processing

546
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,840
otherwise lot of optimization are not
apply

547
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,900
to use a in the record and

548
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,460
in some cases it's better to is able at
that

549
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,910
city on mmm into biz biz

550
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,450
your able to at front compiled trying
times

551
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,950
or you are able to knows a

552
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,150
ones exact type your

553
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,260
you we are able to interrogated I'm

554
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,780
you on pipe system and it will generate

555
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,369
lot of information for at the kills
unfortunately the

556
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,650
my in its state machine implementation
is using

557
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,920
after GI so it's possible to remove them

558
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
for is that it's raining but not to a
fisted calls

559
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,150
a cool sell some drawbacks

560
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:19,260
Mike implementation you got to use as it
was because compiler

561
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,220
and whispers 11 a companion compiler

562
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,250
some part of your position has to be

563
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,750
in sees despues objective-c it's working
well

564
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,640
very well with objective-c because at
least if you are using

565
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,480
able exco the and this ripple

566
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,920
materially what is called objective-c
please please issue

567
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,369
take your normal objective-c I'll which
is Reza

568
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,490
dot and extension just rename to

569
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,720
dot in and you have an objective
sleepers please

570
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,069
fine a mix %uh see

571
00:37:56,069 --> 00:38:00,289
objective-c and cities the

572
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:05,180
opposition will increase in the
executive executable size you see an

573
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,109
example

574
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:11,099
before and after a physician so it's not
a good idea to try to a fifth straight

575
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,140
up truth the

576
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,450
we think it's better to for cues and
accused

577
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,480
committed to getting its better tuned

578
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,130
mmm that on mine which is really
important in your court

579
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,069
it will increase completion time its

580
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:31,230
the father a physician upstream sheets

581
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,160
not so much for the thinnest admission
each other be

582
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,750
units that mission it could be a problem

583
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,380
especially with the Intel compiler the
Intel compiler

584
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,470
is little bit through and

585
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,680
when major drawback is that's

586
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,180
office later this kind of code is
complex to write

587
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,730
and complex to the back in

588
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,970
you are not the beginning with one or
more debugger because the big orange

589
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,779
it runtime: instead drove

590
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:07,950
list of strange the wrong messages and

591
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,980
I'm it's not always views to understand
them

592
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,570
weighty what is wrong it's better wheeze

593
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,750
the latest compatriots mean there are
messages are better ways template

594
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,960
with no it's not so simple and

595
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,230
I didn't find the way to apprise some a
physician

596
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,390
techniques with MATLAB programming
especially

597
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,660
Contador to a graph flattening I'm

598
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,550
it's better to do that and as a label at
the level of the intermediate

599
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,750
representation

600
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:45,950
compiled code and I'll some

601
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,730
benefits you don't have to use in the
next a lot to learn

602
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,250
you don't have to use modified compiler

603
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,710
there is a project which is called

604
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,260
million a.m. obfuscator

605
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,280
which relies on modified compiler its
develop

606
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,900
in Switzerland in that you don't know
but each time

607
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,660
April is releasing a prolonged anybody's
raising a new version of the compiler

608
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,280
you have to we apply to retest exit row
the advantage

609
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,090
my approach is that it's completely was
told

610
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,010
so you don't have this kind of problem
its

611
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,060
dependent on the target platform but
missus

612
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,920
from the compiler and the sophistication

613
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,210
is not the source called level its I

614
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,360
live on so it's possible to med

615
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,930
some very complex a physician for
example

616
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,010
and ideal is to split finish that
machine

617
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,200
in two different places to execute these

618
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,230
at different I'm evened indifferent
spreads

619
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,380
and I'm you it's not

620
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,440
eg it's not completely i'd and to the
use of the library but on most

621
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,180
so you cannot things which are very
complex

622
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:10,010
and code which remains manageable it's
also possible to

623
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,320
use this kind of techniques in with

624
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,020
a US and Apple App Store I'm there are
some

625
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,480
as a opposition techniques large virtual
machines

626
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,470
also decryption at runtime: of portion
of court

627
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,630
but this kind of things are not possible

628
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,110
if you want to publish on Apple App
Store its

629
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,920
its forbidden by up and using my

630
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,470
techniques its possible to make up his
position despite of this limitation

631
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:45,530
I'm continuing and continuing my
research is

632
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,340
mmm tried to applies to adjust give

633
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,540
two examples and not try to apply mill
of efficient techniques

634
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,580
I'd try to find a solution to apply

635
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,700
these to objective-c objective-c

636
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,190
is a dynamic language when you commit to
its

637
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,260
invite you are send a message and this
message is the name of the method

638
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,470
is in the binary and it gives lot

639
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:15,730
of information for an attack a and I try
to find a way to

640
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,510
the to be able to encrypt these

641
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,860
math and then and I'm also working

642
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,820
for a solution for Android of course
Android is written in Java

643
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,470
but it's possible to call miss some

644
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:35,360
calc crispers called and I'm working on
the solution for this but from

645
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,660
or the court presented

646
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,020
year available undeterred and

647
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,900
and the the code contains office later

648
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,200
and some examples it's released on those
Abused the

649
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,000
license so could be used in

650
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,250
almost any project I ever saw a white
paper

651
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,840
which is also available on get up which
describes

652
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,700
in more details min up is kato

653
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,580
and this is

654
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,110
my made contact million

655
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:21,680
email address and my Twitter account and
his

656
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,680
by the end of my might ok

657
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,440
and the question

658
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,500
no okay thank you

659
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,740
but it back to

660
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,220
on compile-time sorry dinner what's the
impact a compile-time

661
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,310
it's very dependent above the compiler
mmm

662
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,560
frankly don't have in the

663
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,110
clear numbers because the dip into the
you try prying

664
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,300
these techniques to there's a accord

665
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,380
everywhere of course you are some impact

666
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,230
what I sees that we as a people a VM

667
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,430
it's not noticeable but for Intel

668
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,420
compiler

669
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,770
it will increase it will double a
compile-time

670
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:28,770
with the finish that mission and as a
question

671
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,210
ok it thank you
