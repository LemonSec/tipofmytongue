1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,580
module up

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,220
I don't blame you I'm not even that way
usually this early in the morning so

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,740
Flickr a so today is my cock

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,049
on solar flares and the impact on the
SCADA systems

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,590
and the dangers are therefore brought to
me by which world powers like at

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,210
autozone important topic

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,470
that we don't cover enough about solar
flares so I will be discussing that non

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,210
turbines are

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,220
it like I know this is a a darker

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,640
as you tell me the kittens a it's about
traveling

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,149
and a different perspectives and as you
can tell that use to the

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,250
cat have a different perspective arm

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,579
so basically I don't get the whole thing
on a woman talking about one explain how

14
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,489
I how I operate on my talks

15
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,500
one year I'm going to give a talk

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,020
on technical like hacking your social
engineering or how I do step in our

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,870
break things

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,570
then the next year I give a rant worries
about the community about how I feel

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,320
weird you noticed something I can just

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,140
me to get off my chest well last year I
did talk on spear fishing so guess what

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,119
this year's ranked I'm

22
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,530
so are so this is gonna be my rant on
how a hat and cultures are different and

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,350
how they change

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,909
a basically the only thing that you need
to know about me

25
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,090
is I like to travel a lot

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,100
II don't just like to go to the
conference and see the people I am in

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,400
here which is a great thing

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,409
but like to explore the city that I mean
I like to walk around I like to be a

29
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,329
part of that culture something on
actually see what goes on in the day

30
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,060
they think I don't just take the tour
bus

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,490
drive around all their the fights you
know it's like it's been 11 hours

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,119
walking in a circle New Zealand

33
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,450
I'll the damn thing wrong with the dang
district in a

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,049
Beijing it like I want from me Coptic
area

35
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,890
a Cairo all the way through up the Nile
to the

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,259
Tyrone Power over six hours it's like
I'll walk ministry to march in a parade

37
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,399
hours and

38
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,009
didn't get the pockets are very happy
about that it's like a but it was just

39
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,590
a great great time I love the experience

40
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,420
I love seeing the people I love my I
love being part in that area and seen

41
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,520
what the places like

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,550
the same thing with accomplices I like
to see the different cultures

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,250
but one important thing I wanna make
sure that we understand

44
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,170
I'm not speaking for any body but me

45
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,599
these are my perceptions in my
perspectives

46
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm not trying to say this is how the
world works for everybody

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,599
so I think Press writer so that the best
he says I like tacos that means all

48
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,110
hackers like tacos right

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,010
no I like pizza but you know that's okay
if I so we are gonna have varying

50
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,200
degrees in differences

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,400
okay so one of the things I want to
start where

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,860
is you get one thing how the talk i'm
talking about. cultures

53
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,910
and the globe in about different
cultures different countries in the

54
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,290
first thing that we all have to go to is
what

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,470
nation-states well guess what my talk is
about nation-states but I want to

56
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,129
address it right off the bat understand
exactly how secured we r stuff you know

57
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,120
when it comes to that

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,540
because you look at that wonderful
rising report and write a report is a

59
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,370
good report I'm not calling the the baby
ugly and stuff you know it's a great

60
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,019
reported a good reports got good detail
on Instagram

61
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,230
but let you know there's something
missing from this report the really

62
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,209
covering the whole area

63
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,500
it let you know that was last year with
this year

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,519
this year that they have a different
port which was cool it cover more area

65
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,690
but love the way they did it they're
able to cover more area because

66
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,769
basically what it means is that and

67
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,959
but say are arm of the Michelle

68
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,360
there was an incident let me to cover
all France

69
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,900
reiker that one will spot it all France

70
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,260
we talk we've got plans cover now so i'd
like

71
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,659
one will please my place in podunk
Mississippi

72
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:54,200
got attacked all-america that's how they
do it so

73
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,650
they got a good cover was less goods but
this dog is good detail they're still

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,099
good numbers in there

75
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,569
but the thing is you have to remember it
is not

76
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,000
all the numbers it's not all the details
it's a

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,760
snapshot of it it's just a this is what
we've seen

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,620
Trustwave got a great report I mean come
on that's a great

79
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,299
the graphics department to get a bonus
that is an awesome work and report

80
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,720
I mean seriously who doesn't like lai I
love my charts

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,970
you know it's like a cool cuz they those
numbers and they

82
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,710
obviously have to be official right so
that was that was a great report I love

83
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,470
that report

84
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,570
once again maybe not quite covering
everywhere

85
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,870
possibly you know just missing a couple
places here and there you know

86
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,850
not major just a couple commenter to but
you know that's great you know it still

87
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,770
gets detail

88
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,300
and this year I don't know their
graphics department was really good last

89
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,560
year stuff you know but something
happened someone got a memo they decide

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,100
to jazz it up a little bit is this is
this year's

91
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,009
wall buddy that looks like I don't know

92
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,389
medfly I don't know if I'm like reading
an inverse that information secure

93
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,580
reporter going to a rave invite but you
know

94
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,539
there you go I do with the fact that you
do see the United States is the attack

95
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,889
source IP addresses

96
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,360
the predominant one so go go America

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,320
yang from but we're still get this
report

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,490
and then it want two things I like not
like reports many numbers but we need to

99
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,900
make sure that we understand

100
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,120
those are all the detail that's why I
like this website the most

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,470
hackman getting dot com gives a report

102
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,039
I love I and it got a pie chart remember
I love my charges that you know but what

103
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,090
I love more about this

104
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,690
my chart decided being a pie chart is it
got the flax

105
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,639
because let's face it in america's that
we know we don't know another country's

106
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,430
flag into which are invading them and
stuff so this was great

107
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,759
that we actually got to see what up the
flags are stuff you know on on the on

108
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,900
the parts are to be gets more
information

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,060
and we gotta a nice lesson in and
flagged ship though

110
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,570
but look at what I really like about it
was the disclaimer

111
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,419
on how to get inside and it read

112
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,050
again no need to repeat the data must be
taken very carefully since they do refer

113
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,620
only to the discovered attacks

114
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,400
the so-called tipped the iceberg in
hymns do not pretend

115
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,120
to be exhausted but only aim to provide
a high-level overview

116
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,720
at the global cyber lights kit landscape
I love

117
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,440
that disclaimer I will for give you the
fiber because that disclaimer so good

118
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,009
he says he's not trying to pretend to be
exhaustive

119
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,759
Parnevik honorable unlike some reports a
try to be the de facto standard

120
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,479
the Bible all the information security
this guy is saying straight-out

121
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,479
this is what I see I don't see
everything

122
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,180
but from what I see this is what's going
on thank you

123
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,620
for some honesty and clarity that's what
we need other reports

124
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,930
our little bit more specific not trying
to cover the whole globe order trying to

125
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,930
be more specific you're trying to do

126
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,449
some paint a different picture with
their data

127
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,780
this seems to be like a this is not a
thing for more games

128
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,900
up but this does seem to be like a a
directed

129
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,130
attack based on the numbers which is
good

130
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,300
because that empirical data that show
something

131
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,190
it's like if you've gone three days
later

132
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,259
you could probably see the reverse
attack going on

133
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,940
an average shown more data is that you
know that in back by your cleverness

134
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,270
which is great it's like my problem is

135
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,949
in this is where things i wanna talk
about when we talk about culture and

136
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,419
perception

137
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,699
is some reports seem to be a little bit
more targeted

138
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,289
I yeah you know I'm bringing up the the
Manning report I don't know about you

139
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,419
but me personally I honestly believe
that at some time went house security

140
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,940
was a little child and stuff you know

141
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,710
China came over and stole lunch money
it's like right when I mean I really

142
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,990
wanna look in and talk to him and say
dude like tell me on the map

143
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,449
work words or China you know touched you
could your networkers

144
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,220
him as a man that it's like because it
seem so directed

145
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,810
so prejudiced against with the
information that they they were

146
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,370
most to the information rap to go with
thing with their singles burger but it

147
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,370
was very slanted in on as I just my
opinion

148
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,669
that when I actually did a Google search
for the man to report

149
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,860
this was the first slide the first image
that came up

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,039
so I'm not the only one thinking that
maybe the main airport was a little bit

151
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,470
too you know

152
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,410
directed I or obscured film

153
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,910
other good another thing I just received
yesterday

154
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,990
which this next slide shows you
everything that is wrong

155
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,060
with information security marketing he
shows you what are the major things that

156
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,019
are wrong with our industry

157
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:40,000
this is disgusting

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,849
you're saying that the only this is like
from

159
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,560
lousy company and I don't my column
outfits that you know that's why didn't

160
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,050
censor anything

161
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,459
it's like this is what they think is
considered

162
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:57,470
okay billing in OK marketing

163
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,240
what is wrong with us on that

164
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,380
that is irritating because the fact they
think that what is your engine do think

165
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,830
basically what the forensic engine is
basically some teenaged the tech Chinese

166
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,570
characters in the 2008 BET

167
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,290
seriously it's like that's the only kind
address their coming through

168
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,380
that is a lousy company that allow the
technology

169
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,779
I don't need that that's what they think
the bread is they obviously don't know

170
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,620
what they're doing

171
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,240
and they don't know what are our address
really are out there

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,399
a good to me that polka in that
determined well it going today

173
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,670
for a moment that you know we're gonna
go after and what the guy say

174
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,209
it started right now letter of getting
nation-state out the way

175
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,940
the Chinese are bad because up all these
things right these promises bondar

176
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,420
countries the impact on the nation's

177
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,580
with malware that right is the press
they try to suppress voters

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,019
let's let's review that Xiaohui let's
review

179
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,269
the first what they do they find their
citizens

180
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:59,170
let's talk about that for a second
because that's not cool right

181
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,990
awake ok

182
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,160
long flight I guess that was right will
my bad I love the fact one right here

183
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,370
anything admits employees by Don
husbands boyfriends and girlfriends

184
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,490
so basically the responses we need to
get spies to spy on the other spires

185
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,700
they're spying on people they should be
spying on

186
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,560
even the worst bike and everyone how
does that work

187
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,149
right it's like I love the fact that
they get to do all that spying and stuff

188
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,110
you know because it's like

189
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,640
the show that they're doing their job
right well what was the second bullet

190
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,310
something about them spying on other
countries

191
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,200
all that's not good and other factors
like they

192
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,140
there's the US courage to shore up
spying on russia because the fact that

193
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,430
they didn't even understand what was
going on in russia

194
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,540
there cubans by a boyfriend and
girlfriend to figure that out

195
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,750
another you look look at Merkle lookout
fascias you

196
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,940
of that is the make a German that's sad
that bad

197
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,240
that lady wasn't that sad since George W
Bush broker

198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,190
okay it's like there's a horrible thing
to do it I feel bad for them

199
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,630
and look right here a time magazine says
the US by

200
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,670
their US spies listen to the Pope the
Vatican says their own work

201
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,250
come on people I don't care what
religion you or I don't care if you're

202
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,110
eightieth I don't care what you believes
or you have to admit

203
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,329
we've got a pretty good pop right now
okay that a good poem

204
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,600
I like this pope he is a good guy

205
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,610
I mean Spina other guy with the red
shoes maybe with the single

206
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,800
get you be okay but this the good bro we
liked as Pope

207
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,029
why spying on him it's like you know
this is not cool

208
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:41,930
so for their egos I so we would not
those two down

209
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,000
both the next one

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,910
well that was in it there we go

211
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,029
lol they infect other nation computers
with malware

212
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,529
that a horrible thing did do group

213
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,510
I am you on the things I love about the
stocks that part of it is

214
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,029
like that's the great part is america's
like when when they're doing in 70

215
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,389
usually when you called out that there's
all these denials about

216
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,300
dare you accuse the conductivity America
was like

217
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,660
how Jerry accused activity

218
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,560
that is a horrible they would accuse the
first such great workmanship

219
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,139
to accuse over such a highly targeted
and sophisticated

220
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,700
in advance beautifully executed program

221
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,660
that is just ludicrous and beyond thank
you very much we have to wear our work

222
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,279
but yes that is horrible how dare you

223
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,360
you know you get there is like so will
the

224
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,190
whoa that another like theresa we're
almost there for their turn it into the

225
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,920
press that warble thing

226
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,889
but we've got our first amendment right
it's like you know the freedom of the

227
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:46,670
press

228
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,700
that's a good thing to have usually

229
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,899
sometimes it's like if you can get away
with it

230
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,120
so there we go that's an that's another
problem that we're having faith

231
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,410
the 1i I really have an issue with right
here they try to suppress protesters

232
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,180
that's not cool right

233
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,810
well crap I love this when I hear the
picture in the far right is beautiful

234
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,100
that is what George W Bush called a free
speech

235
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,279
down there is a more well and stuff
right there you know

236
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,180
if you can't tell what the three species
on it that's right there by the machine

237
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,670
guns

238
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,880
in the steel barricade it's like you may
not have noticed it but it's right there

239
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,959
that your free speech zone it's like and
the other one here

240
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,130
should love the look the new evidence
that the US Army hired

241
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,240
wise to go undercover among the local
anti-war protesters

242
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,170
what they don't say is true that was
protesters were there with the Quakers

243
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,240
own bad going to the pope you go into
the Quakers I mean seriously and that

244
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,990
little

245
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,260
living room coffee collection stuff you
know what they're both the bean coffee

246
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,370
that the disturbance you have to be
worried about

247
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,130
so it just this is really sad but yes
also what we've done hopefully

248
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,399
and what I wanted to show beyond a
shadow of a doubt

249
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,880
is we're all doing it

250
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,420
every country for look at this map
showing Star Command Control areas

251
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,399
view 38 in one local country only

252
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,889
are you being attacked by one country

253
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,170
no your unit being attacked by Canada

254
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,459
cather I mean I can just imagine that
hacker over there right now gone like

255
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,680
excuse me I'm going to have to be on
your machine I'm sorry

256
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,870
the if you don't terribly mind is that
you know I'm going to the store your

257
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,959
infrastructure

258
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,019
you know it's like a i mean car even
Canada getting in on the action

259
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:39,019
everybody's doing it people this isn't

260
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,079
a one country issue this is an

261
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,730
a One Nation problem

262
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,860
so basically this is the way it goes
it's like the good common thing in

263
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,839
america is your friend would jump off
the bridge would you

264
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,670
well yes because it seemed like the
thing to do with time

265
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,220
so we're all doing it so no more
nation-state I'm not talk when I

266
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,649
topless dress this talk it is about what
matters is about hacking cultured about

267
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,480
hackers it is about the actual

268
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,649
art a packing forget the government part
of it

269
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:14,550
forget what ideas we're talking about
what matters in this bout being us

270
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,810
so let's start this trooper around the
world in 80 days

271
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,570
that's where I got the title because I
wanted to start talking about how

272
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,949
different cultures are

273
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:27,320
so what I'd done basically is I'm going
to share a story from a different region

274
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,300
and then I'm gonna have someone from
that region answer some questions about

275
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,889
it your survey that I gave out

276
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,100
so my first Bob up

277
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,490
round up there is going to China it's
like 2008 was the first time I got my

278
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,709
passport

279
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:50,160
I got in September 2008 November 2008 I
went on my first trip to Beijing

280
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,579
cuz you gonna go big go big you know
it's like so

281
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,910
I went to ex-con a wonderful conference
there

282
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,259
it's like it was a great comedy very
formal comment I was I'm used to like

283
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,910
you know the rowdy like that congress

284
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,709
do you know her everybody was very
warmly it's like they had like

285
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:09,430
odd teacups and like really cool was
very early as the real

286
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,670
we was very nice there with people that
were sharing information they were

287
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,459
talking

288
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:17,769
I had a conversation with a guy brahmin

289
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,620
the Shanghai police force and he was
talking about some the challenges that

290
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,660
he pays

291
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,320
dealing with cybercrime within China
there is the issue of cybercrime going

292
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,680
on

293
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,940
within China it's like they have limits
and they have a responsibility that they

294
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,860
have to go through

295
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,089
it's like it if I can you see that going
on in your eye

296
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,839
talking to this guy I mean seriously
happen to the conversation went to go

297
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,079
bring in your body York I know it's bad
ill

298
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,610
it's just this way in america we have
the same problems don't worry with

299
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,449
I'd noticed on that moment on that trip

300
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,459
I realized how close-minded her house

301
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,990
changed by the way that the media's
shows how the rest to the world is

302
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,839
I was so in the dark about it showed
that became my mission to start

303
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,179
understanding the cultures

304
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,490
stop listening to what I was told and
raised on

305
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,839
and started trying to go with a fresh
perspective in C the country from the

306
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,309
people that are actually there

307
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,439
and get that other side to the story
because obviously I wasn't getting it

308
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,949
up until then so that was my

309
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,669
in my purse experiences as well as talk
to someone that's up from that area

310
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,950
he says well what country are you
familiar with the guys from India

311
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,080
is how did you find out about hacking he
said the Matrix movie

312
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,950
cool people hacked into the majors
indeed cool kung fu

313
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,169
you know the other word a in your region
house acne thing by the general public

314
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:44,010
negative attack in your region seems
more for crime had to this nation's

315
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,010
deter other

316
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,049
just simply crime

317
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,080
that a lacy hacking in that region

318
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,660
crime wasn't happy about that answer

319
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,140
but thats is answered that's what his
perset perception was

320
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,660
that's not my perception that's not what
I want my perception to be

321
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,200
but I have to go with what the survey
says

322
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,210
let's talk about look represent that
mean Nico

323
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,669
that compares couple years ago lester
about Europe

324
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,080
it's like me or my purchase period is an
icon year was a

325
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,090
actually in with the hat I'll talk about
my at my first

326
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,090
new attack four years ago on believable

327
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,929
and I'm not saying that because I'm at a
place where there's some people tonight

328
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:26,799
we're here

329
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,510
it's like i'm saying because it's true
it's like it is a

330
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,549
encapsulated concentrated

331
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:38,220
a drug deal just one I mean this was
like going to Def Con for three days you

332
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,179
do it in one night

333
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,210
it was awesome their workshops there
were

334
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,190
the CTF barrier there were people
meeting and talking and learning

335
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,419
that is what it's about and that's when
I was overwhelmed with in the

336
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:53,289
friendliness

337
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:57,360
in the acceptance that we know from a
guy who doesn't I tell people stuff you

338
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,289
know it's like I'm sorry im from
America's only speak English in from

339
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,419
Texas I don't speak it very well

340
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,850
and is like but people were willing to
come up and talk to me people ruling up

341
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,039
to share information with me

342
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,320
it was awesome I had a great time there

343
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,429
answer that was when my purse
experiences in Europe what was the

344
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:17,660
that conference le talk to our

345
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,120
the let's go back to the the survey
again what country more familiar with

346
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,070
Belgium

347
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,970
how'd you find out about hacking was
connected to the BBs and B da net

348
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,970
by donor like that old school so the
guys been around

349
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,679
for a while I in the region house
packing seen by the general public

350
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,910
the term hacker is immediately into bad
guy due to the bad uses the word

351
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,500
the a and the press go figure

352
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,880
is hacking into regencies more for crime
had to this nation state or other

353
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,780
crime first and foremost to activity was
anonymous campaign to get well known

354
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,720
companies

355
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,530
that was massively rigged relayed by the
press once again the press helping shape

356
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,600
the story

357
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,780
hackers are bad and the bad guys so

358
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,929
as the next one let's go to South
America

359
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,320
my my only experience with I i went to
Brazil for conference there

360
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,250
and want to play its part to the whole
conversation without that the speaker

361
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,309
dinner

362
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,030
M-one the Brazilian hackers are was
actually talking about the back

363
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,350
that he didn't have any proper streak
red you'd like

364
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,070
yeah I'm not even seem like government
seems cool here is that you know because

365
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,640
hacking

366
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,390
not illegal so we're not the Mike is
like the cool guys really weird issues

367
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,330
but should we didn't

368
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,770
nerd cuz it's like we're not committing
a crime to Mike I'm sorry

369
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,850
maybe you'll get arrested one day I I'm
I don't what my book that they do this

370
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,400
is like but the good news is they
recently a pass laws against

371
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,150
packing now so he should be happy right
it's like so

372
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't really know how to address that
situation but once again it was a

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,159
different culture them I just accepted

374
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
okay so let's talk to %uh someone from
Brazil

375
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,559
ages how did you find out about hacking
and I love this answer

376
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,919
trying to get things done because what
exemplifies a hacker more than that

377
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,179
statement right there

378
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:11,470
trying to get things done the you read
it house hadn't seen by the general

379
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,130
public

380
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,000
nowadays the midterm good and bad people
sort of understand it back in the day

381
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,900
early 9th

382
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,120
internet wasn't quite widespread PBS's

383
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,120
a stolen credentials universities are
the way to go at that point I mean let

384
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,669
you were doing something he wouldn't
really be aware hacking

385
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:29,860
with online banking being in implement a
96 97

386
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,780
bankers actively start increasing
quickly in Brazil bank effectively means

387
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,520
that no credit card fraud and stealing

388
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,710
from the banks and stuff so I attacking
region seems more for crime had this

389
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,110
nation state or other considering those
that don't know anything about it

390
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,289
just eased up in the news mostly tied
the crime

391
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:49,480
and sometimes activism in the corporate
world a better understanding to at the

392
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,230
hacking

393
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,010
do theater in your forming

394
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,460
I did my talk started changing is like
my my attitude started changing

395
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,080
let's go to Africa if I after to cheat
on this one

396
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,309
okay because the only place I've been to
Africa technically was

397
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:09,350
Egypt and I'm being told from other
people like back toward the middle east

398
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,570
asians like pay

399
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,110
geographically it's Africa so I been
there okay accounts

400
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,830
okay I'm not good at all and one thing I
like about this is be

401
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,440
in cairo the I feel so bad for the
egyptians I really didn't mean to be his

402
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,340
website

403
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,270
they put me in a suit so all the
attendees had the false impression that

404
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,549
I was mature

405
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,850
in like a business-like person okay as
you can tell from the pictures I

406
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,990
tolley disabused a move that notion
quickly as like a one my papers is up

407
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,320
does

408
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,130
the in Egypt the comp ridge was like it
with a straight up packing conference

409
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,260
but everybody was like this was a
business function

410
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,900
this was like this was where you
exchange business cards and you talk

411
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,220
about

412
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,950
yes I crack dat doe program is up you
know with the zero day that I

413
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,020
implemented in stuff you know it was all
very number very well done

414
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,360
and I'm live was way too formal for me
might be my favorite moments though I

415
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,270
have to be on my their Obama's was

416
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,440
ace won the students here in the picture
it's like

417
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,390
but he never been to a hacking
conference before so he doesn't like

418
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,070
awesome so

419
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,799
he take that picture you know the
pictures I've done this picture in a

420
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,010
picture for the banner

421
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,900
that cock another the I'm here

422
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,919
at the conference you know he did he
took that picture like that

423
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:33,919
not realizing 20p behind on I within the
frame going like this in my sleep

424
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,860
of them polo bomb I love that picture so

425
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,230
without about my experience the to

426
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,919
to egypt is up you know and and the
continent Africa let's talk to them that

427
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:45,470
actually

428
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,520
a bit more you know resident there he's
without African

429
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,720
they how'd you find out about hacking
when trying to call you K long distance

430
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,100
numbers from South Africa during
apartheid

431
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,279
so he drowned a problem

432
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,950
he look for a solution moves like any
founded

433
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,090
true hacker mentality in your region how
packing seen by the general public

434
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,320
there is still a stigma attached to
hacking as in hacking into network

435
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,740
adapter overbuilding

436
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,090
is seen as more criminal than anything
is hacking your region theme for more as

437
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,730
prime had was nations that are other

438
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,120
the media have dictated the view hackers
in most countries

439
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,950
so it's hard to put a positive spin on
it also kernels and you when hackers

440
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,679
are put in the same category

441
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,110
really move on

442
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,059
let's talk about the Middle East it's
like I'll 10 very experiences from the

443
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:36,779
reasons like a

444
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,140
when I went to a Beirut Lebanon it's
like I was only a conference there

445
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,220
and are means brands there and when the
guys

446
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,549
I met there was new hackers
up-and-coming studio

447
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:50,590
anyone to show me something I have not
come without some new account working

448
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,080
working on is that you know

449
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,279
and the work he was working on was the
ad for access to the nation's telecom

450
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,220
system

451
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,620
on his laptop I might

452
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,940
cool hope anything like yeah I'd like

453
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,730
a guy I have like four years unlike what
are you doing with it

454
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,570
they would you not like he's not met
with his bill replaces bill regularly

455
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,679
he's not you drop in other people's
conversations are trying to do jitter

456
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,659
just have access good why not

457
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:27,090
well i cool it's like it is literally
the wild wild west out there

458
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,750
it's like when it comes to Hagel's there
are so many the technologies have been

459
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,529
on the actual computer

460
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:36,720
network intrusions in the in the
securities that you know if not really

461
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,940
out there right now there's a based on
physical security and worried about that

462
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,490
dealers in the other to protect their
networks as well okay

463
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,870
I'm not gonna talk about how many
nations statements that you know how

464
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,720
Cisco Cisco for their routers the other
at the edge

465
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,010
other countries okay there's a lot

466
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,279
as large as the Middle East it like is
just one those things

467
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,610
so let's talk to someone from those who
is right she did cuz I G

468
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,210
because I don't mind it's like a is like
nombre don't say that the gypsies the

469
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,140
Middle East because

470
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,480
this was a good a response is white work
under more from the web aged

471
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,360
the how'd you find out about hacking I
love this one caught a virus in 2005

472
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,929
because they

473
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,400
certain person downloaded pirated games

474
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,260
and it was back toward I wonder who that
was I wondered how those bars

475
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,960
worms work learn some programming first
by viewing sample parses sources and

476
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,600
walk that wrote it never went back

477
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,720
take that in for a second is like he was
compromised

478
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,870
is that it is being the big time just
consider being the person that was like

479
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,559
oh I'm

480
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,980
I've been attacked he was alive mom

481
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,419
on how that works but let's but reversed
and see what happens

482
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,250
but see what goes on backs the hacker
mentality

483
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,990
if I in your region house magazine by
the general public hacking is generally

484
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,470
viewed

485
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,950
as packing people's Facebook and Yahoo
accounts

486
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,150
how sad is that they're still using I'm

487
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,390
makes you wanna cry okay start and
you're reading How tacking seen by the

488
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,580
general public

489
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,440
are you KK vacuna region seems more for
crime accusations that are other

490
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,460
most viewed as a crime do you know about
activism

491
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,500
and that's after proper square only if
you know about activism

492
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,130
so letter about North America it's like
a.m.

493
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,659
i were now with the covers I want our
problem talk about

494
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:35,850
and what my talked about his black
community it is about people

495
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,600
getting involved in stuff known about
hackers and what happened

496
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,990
to be a happy really means I had to talk
about Derby Conn

497
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,149
not just because the guy credit is
actually showed up

498
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,240
up particular so

499
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,270
I go there is like you go to Derby Conn

500
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,870
and the one thing that you know about it
right off the bat

501
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,429
is that everybody is on the same plane

502
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,710
everybody's on the same field it's like
you have HD Moore sittin in the lobbyist

503
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,279
up working I learned a new trick

504
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,370
on a hard disk encryption for me on
which was awesome uses that in the lobby

505
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,659
is

506
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:12,320
working on his laptop work on
presentation Egypt rameriz

507
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,470
17 rapid7 was like playing chess bring
by this showed up

508
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,549
all in all matters in the night 70 and I
think the more

509
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:22,890
drunk he got the better he played chess
I don't know how that works

510
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,929
okay but it works preamp girls like

511
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,490
good on him it's like bad on a minute
ride a challenge from

512
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,590
it's like but there was a city there
were

513
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,070
no egos there was no

514
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,720
all that that person it was hey there's
that person

515
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,120
with come over and talk that's the way
it should be

516
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,690
everywhere we're all here

517
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,630
to learn from one another I have learned
stuff from this program from this

518
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,919
conference

519
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,919
is that you know and I hope the learned
something for me it is not a one-way

520
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,870
street

521
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,740
is for both of us all this together to
start talking in meeting everybody

522
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,070
there is party responsibility is being
100 like to get to know in connect with

523
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,770
other people

524
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,270
everybody in this room has the same
passion they have an interest in what

525
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,870
we're doing or they wouldn't be here

526
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,149
and as they want to be your business's
way to talk to family doing I don't know

527
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:21,429
but most everybody in here that should
be their main goal

528
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:24,490
that should be the reason

529
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,279
so let's talk about the surveyor 100
more familiar with the USA

530
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,850
how'd you find out about hacking first
movies then probably through an

531
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,700
instructor

532
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,970
instructor in vocational program in high
school which I thought was really cool

533
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,799
I love the movies parties like let's
face it Angelina Jolie the movie hackers

534
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,789
got more people into hacking than any

535
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:45,799
by man your book out there okay month
that's just the way it works

536
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:49,700
a in your region house Magnussen by the
general public negative

537
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,210
it hacking your region seen as more for
crime had to this nation state or other

538
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,110
crime people think the bill that anyone
who make something behave outside how

539
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,799
was the binder automatic committing a
crime

540
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,789
the same people during the forties in
the sixties been a good amount of their

541
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:04,279
time

542
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:11,279
working in building hot rod my buying
cars

543
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,059
this is really the point where I get
pissed off

544
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,390
because Mike talk was not about this

545
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,529
might talk with bows to be about how our
cultures were different

546
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:28,470
how the Malaysian hackers were more to
happen spaces the German hackers are

547
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,970
more about privacy right

548
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,299
how others more reverse engineering is
that no one remembers is the other

549
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,820
this is not a talk about how we're
criminals

550
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,120
this was not supposed to be a talk about
one the biggest unifying things that we

551
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,330
have in our

552
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:51,179
a community is that were seen as
something back

553
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,710
that a pins me

554
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,179
this is art history lesson people be
either hackers

555
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,679
this is where we came from

556
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,750
Alan Turing the master encryption

557
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:15,370
said thousands alive during world war 2
gripping the milling machine

558
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,690
he was a hero and good social life style
wasn't built into the public nor mister

559
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,120
bean only with castrated committed
suicide

560
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,370
by the public any faint

561
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,539
what about neck like Tesla

562
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:35,429
the father open source the reason why we
are denied a lot of his inventions is

563
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,510
because he didn't want to make money on
it

564
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,450
so people didn't want to invest in it

565
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:48,000
he died alone in his hotel room took to
make two days to figure out it was dead

566
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,610
the greatest love is like with a pigeon
that he say did New York

567
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,200
Central Park that was his reward

568
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,640
paul got let Belgium sorry guys

569
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,740
al gore didn't invent the Internet he
did in 1934

570
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,130
creating though the foundation at what
the internet was supposed to be

571
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,330
and what it was like a major

572
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,440
massive peace activist that wanted
nothing but to make the world

573
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,899
better we still uses indexing system

574
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:28,669
die destitute 1944 because no one really
believed in that dream

575
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:32,080
Ada Lovelace let me did mine

576
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,740
only comin I'm going to make on

577
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,149
the women in tech industry okay

578
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:44,269
she's the first computer programmer she
started the computer programming

579
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:45,940
movement

580
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,260
because he was you know even after that
she was of a sidebar banned commercial

581
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,019
believes that we know and she died
mister richard Miller cancers to the

582
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:54,620
actual

583
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,880
cancer itself but back

584
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,059
is who started it women

585
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,149
have not been allowed into tech people
women let me

586
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,919
into tech they started it

587
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,240
this is very industry I got to be a part
up

588
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,710
what about a another one my famous
Cooper hackers

589
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,970
leonardo Da vinci:

590
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,370
he was like that the consummate goal
what a hacker should be

591
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,370
but he died really well loved by
everybody around him stepping on a

592
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,970
prince came up Alistair to retire in so
it into my married and I'm trying to

593
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,179
manipulate your emotions

594
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,250
but our be a so we won't talk about him
okay

595
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,500
on so here we go

596
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,309
that's where we started though from
Dover hackers

597
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,640
it then urged artist creators

598
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,950
they solve the world differently think
this is the way people tell me it's

599
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,970
supposed to be

600
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,549
let me do it somewhere else

601
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:02,470
so where do we go we go to this

602
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,860
bernau the billing in the store

603
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,379
review they were the bill I'm look at
this

604
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:15,570
jury handed to you and I'm not gonna the
bank and I'm not trying to comment make

605
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,510
a commentary

606
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,300
on it they were guilty or innocent or
not not part of this

607
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,369
conversation the day is the third in
think

608
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,530
Jerry him in 10 years for hacking

609
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,060
we got ten years for hacking was
overturned

610
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,500
finally all he did was browse the
directory

611
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,989
let's face it when you're in the
nineties in certain places maybe you

612
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,000
should search you want to go to the
picture folders

613
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,139
you did the same thing so

614
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,810
we could all be criminals at one time or
another by browsing the directory

615
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,230
structure in a row

616
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,149
max ray Butler 13 years for hacking
Roman baguette eighteen years for

617
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:55,700
hacking

618
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,829
Albert Gonzalez deserved twenty years
tracking

619
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:04,589
that was the crime

620
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:08,160
was a risk whether reasonable sugar then

621
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,839
I don't know but I will give you maybe a
counterpoint

622
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,230
maybe a different perspective may leak
Richmond one year for rape

623
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,270
your heart backer one year for
involuntary manslaughter a firefighter

624
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,440
Trent Mays two years for rape

625
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,579
set warren burger 36 years from
voluntary manslaughter was pleaded down

626
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,190
for murder

627
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,390
Jessica ratio five years for murder a
23-month-old power that she was

628
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,650
babysitting crashed his head in

629
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,680
that's a crime

630
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,140
she's probably already out by the time
the stock has been given

631
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,450
those hackers most ovum still in prison

632
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,720
where's the justice now and the problem
is

633
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,460
us as well one thing that I hate

634
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,849
about the way that we talk about hacking
in a talk to a judicial

635
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:11,700
is that we like to be that mysterious
hacker figure guess what people

636
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,609
what humans don't understand a peer what
they fear they tried to destroy

637
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,050
so you get a jury up your peers

638
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,540
who don't even know how to turn on their
computer or respond to AOL properly

639
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:34,540
and knows the people me giving you
sentences for things that you've done

640
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,250
let's talk about some other criminals
here's bill gates

641
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,390
1970 in the nineteen seventies when he
was in school

642
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,560
but big are they brought computer Tom in
high school

643
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,530
they actually stole the administrator
password they won't say how they did

644
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,480
but it's a fact that they stole that
mister a path for their taxes into the

645
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,940
II third party companies says Tom to get
more computer time

646
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,180
how many years in jail did they get

647
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,119
they got to computer time revoked its
cool

648
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,040
and they created Windows on which is
greater offense but you know

649
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,849
there you go so that's what they did

650
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:19,700
okay we're talking about another
criminal if I go about these two guys

651
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,280
these you guys to jobs and Wozniak so
blue boxes

652
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,790
even legal telephone devices to
circumvent the system

653
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,280
to make free phone calls to defraud ad
business a reputable business company

654
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,410
trying to make a living was never even
funny about it but a warranty inside the

655
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,920
box

656
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,490
for the Gotye was one of three a
guarantee on an illegal d legal product

657
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,660
which he submitted

658
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,390
and such a quirky ok well way appeal to
walk back to the view from

659
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,750
it kinda strange in itself that kind of
unusual but I thought it was worth a

660
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,550
joke

661
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:56,540
not the prison time but the joke it's
like between 1973 in 35 through the

662
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,780
Oktober are the Berkeley blues customers

663
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,270
that stir hacker handles because they're
your cool I were

664
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,390
the Barton wound up at the FBI
laboratory where they were def them

665
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,579
disassembled and analyzed because they
were

666
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,640
criminal devices but they got like three
years since is

667
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,280
no I'm jokingly got iPhones but you know
I'm

668
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,280
that's what happens back are rewarded
those criminals back in the day

669
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,099
what about 2010 another young man who'd
already

670
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,520
founded a multi-million dollar company
broke into utility closet at the

671
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,579
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

672
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,410
hook up the laptop to the campus network
and downloaded four million academic

673
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,430
journal articles

674
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,930
most a VM in the public domain from a
paid

675
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,329
archive to which he had a description he
was arrested

676
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:49,859
indicted twice on multiple counts of
fraud in a trial that was to the gun

677
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:50,510
enable

678
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,710
could have faced fifty years in federal
prison and a $1 million dollar fine

679
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,980
his name was Aaron Swartz he was hounded
to death

680
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,390
by governments up you know that he was
trying to do something on a page

681
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,990
description

682
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:10,030
forty years ago guy breaks into a
network

683
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,190
instilled credentials get the pound a
million dollar company

684
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,320
nowadays million dollar guy who owns a
company

685
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,829
get down to death for prosecution over
crime like that

686
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:26,420
wat went wrong

687
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,770
I can understand in a change in a
hundred years

688
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,810
from being artist created in hackers

689
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:39,470
but forty years ago it wasn't like this

690
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,770
this change the media's perception that
how we are

691
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:49,089
that we've helped fuel look at the
picture this is an actor the National

692
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,579
I mean I'm on Thursday I ever gonna see
the picture I get the inside the program

693
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:55,140
had it

694
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,329
I mean it's crazy this is what they're
saying

695
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,040
Packers are my computer room is cold

696
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,150
I have never hacked with a 34-yard in
the ski mask on

697
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,240
is never that cold

698
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,130
wire these media getting these kinda
representations about

699
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,410
in wire they spread in this image well

700
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,099
we help a little bit you now these are
actual hackers

701
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:25,430
is like a i think a massage I'm not
gonna too much when I want the

702
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:31,569
but it's like this is actually you know
don't volunteering for this picture

703
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:35,020
and is now the media represents the good
guys

704
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,260
welcome to fiber you rate John joins
with colleges to train the next

705
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,780
generation

706
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,040
that ninjas so if you're a hacker here
now

707
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,359
role if you're a geek and a keyboard
that you know doing the good stuff

708
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:51,060
you're a ninja I am personally offended
that image because

709
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,410
I'm a ninja okay not the way we go

710
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,099
okay we'll work out like that so I'm nom
nom

711
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,450
I'm not going to miss a ramp what about
this story

712
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,190
Glenn Beck criticizes watchdogs the
video game from promoting hacking

713
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,069
what the heck is wrong with us what the
heck is wrong with him

714
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:13,660
first what have you ever seen from the
show's if not don't try

715
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,670
okay please don't Google that one okay
this guy

716
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,790
is just being on the wrong side going
back is big on the right side history

717
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,710
okay I but yes I would like but that the
best response

718
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,200
the best response I saw this morning
from Bravo hacks

719
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,440
he said I hear watchdog teaches you how
to hack going to expend for educational

720
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,450
training purposes

721
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,280
as the Metra CISSP creds that is awesome

722
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,680
because you know what I think about
trying that that might actually work

723
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,310
that's a good response a better response

724
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:50,500
with what happened here I'll last yr
Derby Conn

725
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,619
there was this guy asked during rigs
jerk off

726
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:57,660
up from this Sat TV station that's the
nicest way that I can talk about them by

727
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,869
the way some sorry

728
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:02,710
but he wrote this thing on its Facebook
page about the Derby Conn hacking

729
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,680
conference

730
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,010
and I'm a try talking his voice game

731
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,839
I don't know how I feel about this Derby
Conn happening at the Hyatt downtown

732
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:16,609
it's a convention for computer hackers
sessions include

733
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:19,680
password cracking hacker war games

734
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,160

754
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,280
we gave them information we educated
them

755
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,210
this was an opportunity to educate the
public and make them aware

756
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,349
what we really were about

757
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:08,589
there was a reasoned response people
were being shown

758
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:12,250
this is what we are this is who we are
we are human we are trying to learn were

759
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,480
trying to place better

760
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,530
I mean for hackers are still wasn't
rolling okay but still

761
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,730
overall it was educational opportunity

762
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,630
so sterling rigs jerk off that the only
thing that he possibly could do

763
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,900
in response to that kinda overwhelming
support in and sorted information on the

764
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,190
subject

765
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,460
he deleted the Facebook post

766
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,210
it no longer bit his narrative what
hackers were so he had to get rid of it

767
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,869
I know you tell me a time but when it
going I'm sorry at like

768
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,280
so let go are we the only ones
responsible for that

769
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,720
are just the media are we just gonna
blame the media those hypocrites

770
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,000
guess what I'm a hypocrite

771
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,660
I'm a hypocrite because I loved making
fun at mcdonnell's

772
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,470
I populated every no bridging the Reno
the cop lady please

773
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,069
others just American thing well back in
the day

774
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:10,750
the reason why you have to have coffee a
pot on the cop is because this lady

775
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,329
supposedly and urban legend is she
filter coffee while driving is that you

776
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:18,220
know and she soon be down for 2.9
million dollars

777
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,720
because our coffee with hot boo hoo our
coffees hot

778
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,589
she was turned into a joke in the
national press

779
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:30,980
about how she's built her coffee on her
cell and it was too hot

780
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,980
and the press rain with that story they
make that story

781
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,819
up MoneySavers obviously it was just it
was all over the place

782
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:43,210
all over the news it was in the talk
shows Jay Leno you know johnny carson

783
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,599
river was at the time like saying the
jokes about it

784
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,720
it was hilarious if you didn't know the
fax

785
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,349
like the fact that she burned fifteen
person ever body that needed skin grafts

786
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:58,640
that mcdonald's served the coffee at a
hundred and

787
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,099
AG-two hundred ninety degrees fahrenheit

788
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:07,079
to keep it hot during the transport the
fact that all those people highlighted

789
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:07,650
in pink

790
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,380
were admitted to emergency rooms because
the scalding on coffee

791
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,950
did it become so funny didn't indeed.com

792
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,319
that message that we hear in the media

793
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:23,540
just what people let me put it simply
I've met the McDonald

794
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,970
a hot coffee lady she is %uh us

795
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,560
we're letting the media show what they
wanna show about us

796
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,410
and not fighting back with it we're
living near him

797
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,890
tell us the narrative we're leaving the
ERM turner's

798
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,520
into that image that we want them this
say

799
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,880
that we're just the National whiskey
math himself on a computer keyboard

800
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,160
it doesn't have to be that way

801
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,400
it doesn't have to be that way at all

802
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,470
once we accept our limits we can go
beyond on

803
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,930
and it's not like we don't have people
showing us

804
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,980
is not like we don't have people
directing us the right way

805
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,040
the great %uh market embarrass people
cuz this is some other people that are

806
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,530
actually

807
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:13,880
leading that that are trying to change
the narrative that are trying to take

808
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,500
back

809
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,880
the word hacker and make it something
good again

810
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,760
it's like dOMAI I know Dave Kennedy he
was on Fox News

811
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,819
it's like i you also may seem on MSNBC
and Fox News

812
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:30,280
I also missing on CNN inbox news he's
also been on Bloomberg in

813
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,859
box news and I think once I'm he was on
the cake your show

814
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:37,440
before he went on the Fox News again the
every time I see you in real life I'm

815
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,780
amazed that there's not a whole kyron
going behind up seventy give me stock

816
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,569
quotes

817
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:45,520
as i've you know I suspect that see that
but look at all these other guys

818
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,730
gonna go ahead and Kaminsky 13 Kevin
Boothe they're out there

819
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:53,660
giving that image they're saying were
hackers

820
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,770
we're trying to educate you we're here
to protect you

821
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:01,420
were from the internet we're here to
help you know it's like that the kinda

822
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,839
messes that we should be giving

823
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,930
and the other question I have is why the
Jets this small group of people

824
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:15,599
why not you my bio says on the time
person the year for the World Cup for

825
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,400
the year

826
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,270
out for 2006 guess what so are you

827
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,589
wired to talking to your local press
your local newspaper your local

828
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:26,780
television show

829
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,720
with the news winner news breaks about
some kinda security thing

830
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,720
giving them the actual proper
information

831
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,470
noper frame but for education

832
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,670
start being a boy in your community

833
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,770
about what happened in years because it
you don't become a voice you're going to

834
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,869
lose it

835
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:51,780
if you don't start showing the helm
wanna true hacker years

836
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,230
they're going to go with you got the the
biggest image who got the biggest

837
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,200
representation

838
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,210
and right now that's the media

839
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,680
that's not the way it's supposed to be

840
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,030
we are from hackers we're from creators
your artist

841
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,760
we are not this guy

842
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,190
because it you do not stand up and start
telling people what hacking years

843
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:19,490
what security years you have people like
this doing it

844
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:24,619
can I just don't like the guy very much
personally so

845
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:27,619
what can we do about it

846
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:31,579
do you understand what hacking years
what the culture magnet is trying to

847
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:34,510
make things better

848
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,990
you do not start hacking by going think
well that goes with it

849
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,359
I wonder if I can make it works no

850
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,500
I would if I could maybe do something
differently sometimes they don't make it

851
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,119
worse in ago I learn something

852
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,650
awesome other help someone fix that the
wood they don't make it worse

853
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,010
in everybody's doing it works

854
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:58,859
but what else do we do we try to change
the stuff around us not just the

855
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,059
computers

856
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:03,380
this is blood coated the blood drive at
Def Con

857
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,300
started three years ago to the loggers
whatever hackers in our community

858
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:12,710
was very sick so what'd hackers do when
that happen

859
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,730
they try to find a solution they had a
blood drive

860
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,670
the first blood code happened one day
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

861
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,099
at Def Con the lady from the Blood
Institute the

862
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:28,690
the blood donation place was in tears
halfway through

863
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:33,339
because they reserved all the spots for
blood donors before 9 a.m.

864
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:37,589
she has been the rest the day telling
people she did have reform

865
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:40,950
that many people tried to come out the
second

866
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,349
you're a blood code was the largest

867
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:49,010
blood drive in Nevada State history

868
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,400
also the injured networks was giving up
party passes so that might help too

869
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,260
but it's like but the third blood code
which was last year

870
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,730
knows which takes no giveaways nothing

871
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,280
it was donate because it's the right
thing to do

872
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,849
second-largest by driving Nevada State
history

873
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:11,410
because that's how hackers do they see
something wrong

874
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,859
they wanna fix it

875
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:20,460
about joining along got johnnie Longview
the missionary in Uganda

876
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,950
he see the problem he went out there
trying to fix it he started out

877
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,609
workings I tried start of you know being
the great happy that he wasn't like he's

878
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:28,500
trying to turn off

879
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,450
I'm gonna pick everything they me
realize okay maybe I'm gonna add support

880
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,470
help detect

881
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:38,829
work for everybody else and and help
provide even more coverage

882
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,050
that's what he does n is great because
it's like you got a certain hackers for

883
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:42,790
charities

884
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,500
another front the circles as i hack
charities I could be like how dare you

885
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,819
help your you had charities known to
know

886
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,930
i hack charity the charity I'm not a bad
guy

887
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,369
as I cannot advertising I commit a crime
stuff you know and i hack you know poor

888
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,160
defenseless you know nonprofits

889
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,020
I and what about this guy right here
this is China evil

890
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,280
it's like he's to johnnie longer China

891
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,550
it's like he goes and puts out computer
systems in school networks missed up in

892
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,069
the western part to China

893
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:16,200
he's a patriot who he hates cybercrime
he

894
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,530
want more people to be more page you're
on and turn away from that kind of stuff

895
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,690
the problem americans that you know you
see is that it's like

896
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,880
it's okay to be a major it they don't
seem to realize that

897
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,760
other countries have Patriots to I'm

898
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,290
for the idea that one that was when
their problems than our stated like

899
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,700
these people are great these are
humanitarian

900
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,059
first exactly where people first effect
we should be hackers

901
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:48,200
first and in the whole country thing is
not is not based my country does not

902
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,200
resolve

903
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,300
on the geographical location I'm at

904
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,089
my family MI environment stepping on my
community

905
00:52:56,089 --> 00:53:01,760
is global because I'm connected by the
Internet to all of them

906
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,510
and Nash the way I see the world that's
not the way I see my country effort to

907
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,750
st. my city

908
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:13,510
that's the way I see the world because
that's where I'm from now

909
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:18,920
and we have to do a quick people because
hackers are breeding

910
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,970
think about that for a second it's okay
to be

911
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,300
the National it okay to be the scary
hacker

912
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,369
and the start realizing that's what
you're leaving your children

913
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:33,380
that's the world you're gonna leave your
children that they're criminals

914
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,329
that their hacking what you're doing
something illegal something mysterious

915
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:38,319
something bad

916
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:42,470
now they need to understand

917
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:45,589
that what hacking years unleashing the
creativity

918
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:49,950
unleashing the believe that to solve
problems and create solutions

919
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,750
won the best moment I've ever had in my
life

920
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,150
was walking down an elementary school
with my daughter hand in hand

921
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,130
whatever school makes walks by she looks
at her schoolmate looks up to me and

922
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:01,579
goes

923
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:04,700
that my dad he's a hacker

924
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,760

925
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,760

927
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,210
I started over the ninja gun trouble
school for that one but but I'm still a

928
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,870
hacker for sure okay

929
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:26,230
that still good and I'm proud of that

930
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,610
and my children are proud that and they
want to be creative

931
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,330
they want to be inventive day want to be

932
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,640
a hacker maybe not for the whole career

933
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,230
but they want to be hacked my my son's

watched YouTube videos million designer

935
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,730

wants to the bell

936
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:57,730
he wants to create and one thing that we
need to let people understand

937
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,870
were not special you're not a special
snowflake sitting in that chair

938
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:06,660
your human hacking

939
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,640
is not something that we just
mysteriously have it's who we are

940
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,710
the children in Ethiopia were given a
box

941
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,980
unopened other Android tablets within
five months

942
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:22,660
not even knowing that the English
language they had hacked the system to

943
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,530
bypass the security functions activate
the cameras

944
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,710
and other restrictions on the machines
vero instruction

945
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:33,840
not even knowing English language

946
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,530
they'd learned it take part themselves
and then they learned how to hack it

947
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,930
because they wanted other feature they
want other things

948
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:45,010
they cleared out a way to do it this
five year old kid hacked into attacked

949
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,160
by the camp because

950
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,360
dad women into the game now with the
motivation

951
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,460
he found a flaw that Microsoft rewarded
him for

952
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,590
because the actual security flaw

953
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:02,840
not the hacker this girl's grandfather
couldn't hold a cup because our

954
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,030
parkinson's disease what does she do

955
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,170
she designed a cop that he could hold

956
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:12,250
there is being marketed now

957
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:16,650
and gonna be on this earth that's gonna
benefit thousands of other people that

958
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,070
suffer the same disease

959
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,260
hacking

960
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,450
is who we are if part a BBQ minutes in
your DNA

961
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,990
is not a mysterious RT you acquire when
you're

962
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:34,500
when you're given a hoodie want you
completed the trial it is

963
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,390
who we are and other humans

964
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:44,950
needed know that so go out there and go
for Tempe that message

965
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:49,450

way to sum it up I think if you kevin

966
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,340

high school

973
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:19,130
start being a community and start
learning showing other people

974
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,460
out there that are in the community show
them what it is

975
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:27,350
and show them why they should be a part
of us because we should be accepting

00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:31,310
everybody not just the ones there the
