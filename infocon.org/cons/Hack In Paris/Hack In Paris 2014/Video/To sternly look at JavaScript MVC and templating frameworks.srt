1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,490
arm my name is Mario and my dogs gonna
be

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,460
similarly emotional them to talk before
but unfortunately but Javascript or it

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,250
might not because you too many people
would let the

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,920
we're gonna talk about JavaScript
model-view-controller frameworks

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,380
oh my friend George and others reason
for that but first for me

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,390
arm as much amor UAE live in Berlin have
a small company with 222 stuff like that

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,600
scrotum papers

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,599
some articles britt some tools and stuff
and inform you have twitter if you feel

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:29,039
like it

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,079
but important is would be going to talk
about today

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,950
and we're going to talk about JavaScript
model-view-controller frameworks

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,170
and the sounds pretty specific but
technically isn't

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,180
because these things are becoming more
and more popular increasingly popular

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,410
and we even have numbers for that so
more and more websites are actually

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,020
deciding to do more things into the
browser

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,500
in javascript instead of on the server
and

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,940
the tremors a special and we can talk
about whether there are security flaws

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,890
in the sand

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,010
if so who maybe there are some how we
can exploit them and what you can learn

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,489
from them and what you can do better in
the past and the future

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,780
so use a numbers and this is a nice
website there's call trends to build

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,820
with that comment it essentially gives
you stats about

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,850
how many website and people you certain
frameworks

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,460
or not and you for example we can see
the usage stats for angular JS and

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,229
Angela J is one of the frameworks for
going to be talking about today

26
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,650
so you can see there's a curve and as
the graphics graphics upward so

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,380
apparently more more people start using
it

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,840
and this is interesting and

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,880
the next question would be what r
JavaScript to view controller from us

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,119
but I these things what is Jay's MBC

31
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,420
and why do we need it in ways that
special well

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,610
for mostly the written in JavaScript
mean this kind of abuse

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,140
and there was not so obvious that that
these things are actually huge

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,280
if you take the code the uncompressed
unfiltered on

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,390
shortened an optimized code in there
like really really big slick hundreds of

36
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,090
kilobytes

37
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,610
so as a developer you agree on just
looking

38
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,850
tons of kilobytes of code and putting it
into a website

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,710
and hope that everything goes well and
given that there be two of two but

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,270
complex

41
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,800
so they do a lot of lot of crazy stuff
that is not possible

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
in the browser in the native way so they
can often reach the APA's if the browser

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,150
and the make for example sure that
certain properties that you would

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,640
normally be able to address

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,010
dahmer to work with injured on cannot be
exist anymore because the frame rickles

46
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,810
in between the

47
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,129
on API and %uh stuff and offers new
things arm

48
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,110
they are not written by hobby
programmers something that that the main

49
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,879
Julie by

50
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,430
are actual corporations so angel address
for example is maintained by Google

51
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,120
and react JS for example is maintained
by Facebook so there's like a big

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,849
interest

53
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,510
the beast remix get better and more
powerful and do stuff and get more

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,360
developer sexy and up to them and use
them and interesting the most

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,150
interesting thing is what they actually
do

56
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,300
because what they do is they provide
developers interfaces

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,140
to completely enable different coding
styles so you don't work with the pros

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,010
are done many more you don't rip it s
website an emerging have a new API and

59
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,730
news types of code in

60
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,629
you objects and properties and functions
to work with and often these

61
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,640
frameworks actually forbid you to work
with the classic way to work with the

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,080
actual

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,110
on and select no you shouldn't you
shouldn't have access to that it's too

64
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,670
dirty out there you should probably use
or API because the nice and clean

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,769
so they cannot fundamentally change the
way developers are working

66
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,099
JavaScript and the way developers are
creating web applications especially

67
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:23,849
like the

68
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,909
you and rich finds a replication
including abs and what not

69
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,440
so here you can see small overview of

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,170
or nice low was at these remarks you can
see for example the tears angular JS

71
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,870
then we have can JS and Amber with good
hands your we have

72
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,849
the love not out which is another
framework that is meant anything by next

73
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,590
much simply

74
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,060
remarkably to see the logo of polymer JS
which is like a very interesting project

75
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,920
and the if you think about what they do
it's usually looking for a good first

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,299
step to go to the website

77
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,459
and asked the framework itself like a
from A+ what are you doing what's what's

78
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,599
written on the About page

79
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,489
and they have a bunch of claims and
amber J is for example says look here

80
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,480
with our framework

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,629
if you start using it then you're going
to be more productive are the box was

82
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:07,510
like that's nice

83
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,189
I want to do that like that's not too
bad Angela JS

84
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:15,760
is but more keen says like any
legislator extend the h2o vocabulary for

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,720
your application

86
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,090
but kinda means that the authors of
English as think

87
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,590
apparently that HTML itself is not
powerful enough so

88
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,229
that they need to extend it and give it
more power and more features the more

89
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,680
stuff you can do with that we will see
this in the second but you actually can

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,120
do so

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,180
then there's can JS and this simply
modestly says

92
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,290
and yeah I'm I have as templates
responsive which isn't that that

93
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,870
and last but not least the chase render
bitch appears to be the ultimate tool

94
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,759
tool to Rule two with because it's
simple it's intuitive and powerful and

95
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,300
expendable and lightning-fast

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,160
through everything you can read from
libraries in there so why use anything

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,430
else

98
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,560
on here to see a bit of example code

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,270
and you see code that is basically
fueling a small amber JS application

100
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,940
and you will notice that this is not
looking like the classic reps at the

101
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,320
triple to the don't seem like the
classic header and body and stuff in

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,470
there but you see like script elements

103
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,199
and from script element you could have
used to that execute execute script

104
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,800
but they don't anymore like they don't
in these particular cases of his remarks

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,020
so here is the script element assist
grips type text X minus handlebars

106
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,620
and then we have something in here that
is in close by this funny little

107
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,400
mustaches

108
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,460
but is curly brackets and it has
chocolate so

109
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,680
you could assume hmm that looks like
some come a templating expression

110
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,699
and by why is it in the script element
well

111
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,860
if you take a script element and you do
with no type

112
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,669
the JavaScript if you're given a script
element you could type text/javascript a

113
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,240
replica applications I was good
reputation ECMAScript or whatever

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,250
something somethings gripped not gonna
be JavaScript if you to ever go ahead

115
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,250
however go ahead and give this group a
different type

116
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,669
then it's by specification data
container so it can contain

117
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:57,800
arbitrary data and going to do nothing
with it just gonna have it on the

118
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,520
patient's its gonna rest their

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,870
and gonna wait for something to happen
minutes exactly what they do here with

120
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,860
this template this

121
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,180
through the stuff into a scrapbook that
can execute its just gonna be there on

122
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,610
the page

123
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,210
an invisible unless you activated use it
and fill it with content

124
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,120
the next book a similar you can see we
have again expect an immersive headline

125
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,430
and you're an unordered list in here

126
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,720
an attorney began reading over something
and the rebuilding lives refilling

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,509
update on the week's top

128
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,410
the adoration and close the list because
the script element mark Turner

129
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,130
and he received parts of the implication
that for example this how we create an

130
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,289
application object

131
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,520
out of camera application create and
then restructure of the object and then

132
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,069
in the end we fill the object

133
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:40,080
actual raw data the supposed to come
from the server

134
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,840
then render the entire thing and we see
that there's some kind of list with

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,919
people that injured

136
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,550
pulling on displaying content

137
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,550
and the here's another example in this
example a little bit more

138
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,860
dramatic because it's coming from with
Angela JS you can see that you don't

139
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,190
have these kind of blocks

140
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,080
you don't have any script element in any
templates and expressions like that

141
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,780
you essentially have a bunch of XML and
thus this pungent smell coat

142
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,470
you can see you have one attribute did
you probably haven't seen before unless

143
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,150
you've been working with anger GS

144
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,710
and it's called in G minor zap ng4
Angela Angie

145
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,690
make which orders on school and that
means that the entire thing that you see

146
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,400
here the entire element from top to the
bottom

147
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,370
is essentially an angular application
and can do stuff but other parts of the

148
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,800
markup cont

149
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,770
so we could only see the bill including
eulogy yes does the happy open the body

150
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,620
we have to prove a label we have an
input in all these things

151
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,910
year again you can see that there's the
10g minus model

152
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,360
notes is your name certain alright fair
enough and then you see headline an h1

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
actually that this hello your name

154
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,509
so who you can tell me with this bit of
code actually does because it's quite

155
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:45,970
interesting

156
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,440
well with this code does is actually
render a form

157
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,870
with an input and once you start typing
to the import the headline is

158
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,210
automatically being written

159
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,220
because this relation between those two
and the framerate assumes that this

160
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,610
would be the thing you want to do

161
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,699
otherwise if the specified little bit
differently and you can see that but

162
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,990
very very few lines of code in very few
additions percentages

163
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,080
this this and that you can already
create fully interactive application

164
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,229
so this is quite powerful there's
another example from Nickelodeon's with

165
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,069
more disgusting you can see the dislike

166
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,220
some select elementary fate on mine is
buying attributes apparently they do

167
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,610
something and kinda

168
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,080
trying to create a certain relation
between this and the actual data

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,780
the new some stuff you're all to binding
then again you can see this pattern

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,780
that there's an object coming in with
actual data so we signed the raw data to

171
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,789
what we

172
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,180
expect to be displaying this data and
then be displayed here under it and we

173
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,990
aren't we see this many application
running on the brosser

174
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,729
which is quite nice arm so essentially

175
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,149
I was gonna love you control a frame
burke's do the following: think

176
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,970
they extend the dawn dramatically so
they say so we need more properties and

177
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,630
more functions more methods with some
objects

178
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,899
the heavily abstract defy the dawn
Saturday not supposed to remove those

179
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,180
parts of the dominie more

180
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,519
you absolutely are not because the too
risky or two shaky and you don't know

181
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,470
what I you know the brothers and so on

182
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,459
so they just give you the only be ice
and even take but on the way from you

183
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,120
and of course necessary the prevention
of a lot of new interface

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,060
arm Angela for example is very complex
in terms of what it allows you to

185
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,260
excess actually in terms of objects in
terms of data so they give you like a

186
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,980
certain school open you can add to the
bone

187
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,420
you can look at all this goal we can
only arm excess stuff isn't at the scope

188
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,250
so it's quite complex

189
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,720
and as already mentioned the commonly
use these script in place let me stay

190
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,470
two blocks

191
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,589
later shown in the in the second example
we have this problem and you for some

192
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,110
stuff in there external or template is
looking an expression is looking and

193
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,290
that's what they do and that is even
permitted by the specification so it's

194
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,029
not some kind of weird hectares

195
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,360
not going to work anymore at some point
on

196
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,810
the tire the the style they are using to
arm

197
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,540
express templating expressions and
create the assignment

198
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,620
between the data and the view to
acquitted is called mostar style so the

199
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,290
use the scurry records

200
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,290
and into the school records they
basically have a label that has pointed

201
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,829
to some object in the scope

202
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,480
and ones that exist they can actually
displayed sometimes or some other

203
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,130
frameworks use a different style

204
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,100
on that is not so nice in my personal
opinion which is better restyle

205
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,110
arm and some other frameworks for
something completely different so they

206
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,250
have a completely different template
expressions with a completely different

207
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,240
limiter something that someone but most
importantly most of these members are

208
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,149
actually using

209
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,320
mark-up sugar that means the take the
HTML that is being specified and then

210
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,519
offered by the brosser

211
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,480
an extended and give more functionality
so with different

212
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,690
and often unknown attributes that you
can only use with this prime rib you can

213
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,279
do stuff

214
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,440
you can from the few Mexican JavaScript
in that it would want to do when talking

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,700
about security

216
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,720
you can even create a custom elements
you can for example creature elemental

217
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,630
Scott Hello Kitty in the distant serving
as the widget and

218
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,920
giving very specific functionality you
just have to use the element no markup

219
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,980
and the rest is being done

220
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,450
automatically when the framework and was
at the prime rib actually make use of

221
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,250
the age 15 data attributes or the custom
data attributes because they allow you

222
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,829
to choose the come up with your own
stuff

223
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,839
in the HTML and still have an a cappella
mark-up

224
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,269
which is also quite useful on

225
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:10,130
this would you can see here is clearly a
good massage look it goes from here to

226
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,870
here too few to hear

227
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,720
and for those who don't have enough
mustaches it doesn't like a really good

228
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,500
mustache

229
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,540
on users like the moment people to
protect themselves like you

230
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,170
but and I have this with us are put
interesting arm

231
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,940
the have been specified in the year 2009
by a guy called once per of

232
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,839
on that happens to be the same guy who
invented get up so he's quite prolific

233
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,529
and he thought about manly Leagues you
to mess with WordPress

234
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,440
on the treaty templates and everybody
gets compromised in this is like a

235
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,339
really bad idea to have templates that
have too much power

236
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,980
so what I wanna have I wanna have like a
standard on my own that ecological as

237
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,839
templates

238
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,269
and is a very good idea because this is
the get templates are not supposed to

239
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,250
have the same power as the controller of
model or anything

240
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,339
they're just templates adjust the post
to display stuff

241
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,990
and great like a bridge between the
user's eyes and the control of the

242
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,070
implication

243
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,269
so he says that you know we need
something simple and something very slim

244
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,899
and something that is secured by default
so whatever you express with this

245
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,730
templating

246
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,339
engine or with this with the standard
that the specified is always

247
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:13,490
escape by default you cannot have XSS
anymore this

248
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,720
this problem the soft but you can't have
it anymore because this is

249
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,480
always edge milling called if a basic
moves in with the conditions that you

250
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
can do when you can see that this

251
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,380
language or the parser for this for this
or alleged list template language

252
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,980
is actually available in a bunch of
languages for your systems and Ruby

253
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,459
JavaScript and Peyton /url on PHP Perl
and so on so

254
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:36,750
people seem to be liking it and superbly
implementing it and like I said it's a

255
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,480
great idea you secure by default

256
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,920
well let's have a look on methodologies
and with the security

257
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,540
and the actually this talk

258
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,040
was inspired by arm last year's

259
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,730
addition of this conference because we
were sitting outside these the quail

260
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,959
lodge number so

261
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,360
talking to with the role who k stock
yesterday

262
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,519
you select yeah I had a look at nugs
they do something weird with styles you

263
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,510
should have a look at that

264
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,450
much would you take a look at that and
no I'm here one year after and giving

265
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,130
the stock so there was something we are
both sides

266
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,250
and the this was the kind of the initial
rationale for the security research that

267
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,779
someone told me you should have a look
at this this is

268
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,050
kind of crazy what they're doing you
doing mark-up stuff so check this out

269
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,630
and I was like no cash should do this
and also it's trending like everybody

270
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,420
starts using it it's very very complex
is like huge monsters of code

271
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,940
and it's different because the kind of
start their own ways in the different

272
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,010
coding styles and

273
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,639
that was mean something so I didn't need
more as a Russian of restoring security

274
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,829
research in this thing

275
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,440
and wasn't there was lazy or select all
right I'm just gonna pope first

276
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,850
and just like take some existing
applications are using these frameworks

277
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,649
kick them a little bit and put them a
little bit and see if something's

278
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,040
something's happening somethings

279
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,790
opening for the website and it was
pretty views to find good example to

280
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,760
others

281
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,240
but then discover to do NBC which is
very very nice effort

282
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,990
on but some people who sell okay we have
a very very simple ap

283
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,690
that is basically to do list but this
app is online in like 20 versions

284
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,680
and each person is composed with the
different primer it's an app it always

285
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,570
does the same

286
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,820
always different primer you can have a
look at these things find out about the

287
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,870
coding styles have like a running
example right away don't know if this

288
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,959
whole learning phase

289
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,139
that was awesome really really nice
application

290
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,420
on my goal in the very beginning was
rather simple

291
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,720
because I just want to have a look into
Latin maybe a confined on common ways to

292
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,800
execute JavaScript or two use the
craziness that they too may be a bit

293
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,570
more

294
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,600
and I want to do this by just using the
JavaScript love you

295
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,310
control of Ranbir capabilities like the
extra stuff that they at

296
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,110
and maybe find more and the after some
time

297
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,949
160 phone stuff I decided that this is
pretty messed up and then we need

298
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,399
something else and maybe kind of

299
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,579
you write the metric for developers or
something but the issue can work with

300
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,190
unrealized

301
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,500
how safe are not safe when all the time
summer from are

302
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,010
but this is for later on what at first
it was having a look at Michael J

303
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,370
yes because it's very very simple an the
acrylic is more than a bit

304
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,180
and it's basically including nOCO genius
make the numbers were 2.3 you know it's

305
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,399
version 3.0 something went through the
very same thing and

306
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,779
then had a development and then I gave
the development a daytime minutes by

307
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,220
attribute and in a field the data
demands find a tribute with

308
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,600
piece of code that says X called into
work one

309
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,750
so to afterwards I have the from a
friend read the stuff and say look no

310
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,190
coat

311
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,740
apply bindings and then surprisingly
this actually you can read one

312
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,199
Clayton okay so that means that all of a
sudden when you use this framework

313
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:44,100
that data minus bind is equivalent to an
event handler or script element because

314
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,250
the technically evaluate script

315
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,550
like even it's nice I mean if you're
confronted

316
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,660
with the repetition pen test and you
have an injection scenario but you can't

317
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,970
quite get your injection

318
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,440
in the nothing really happens but you
might just test if they're using this

319
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,579
member can you just injected at
attribute

320
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,240
because its equivalent was cryptic in
interested

321
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,730
but also by Pashtuns are things that
bypasses the easy access Twitter it

322
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,350
bypasses crumbs XSS filter it bypasses

323
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,259
about every single existing server side
XSS filter and that's like not good so

324
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,310
the Spring River somehow extending the
functionality of the pros are of the

325
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,870
bomb

326
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,110
and enabling us to have more about
things that's those come

327
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,310
interesting and breaking existing
security assumptions

328
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,910
on I like this I like this picture
because when it was going to the bottom

329
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,570
of it

330
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,190
on I kinda realize what they actually
did so after checked

331
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,709
the frameworks public your code that I
could execute ahead look and why is this

332
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,209
would execute

333
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,540
and I was kind of horrible because it
turns out the budget actually do is

334
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,120
they just use a bulb that on bridges
have the sanctions call pars binding

335
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,709
spring

336
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,259
and then you go in here to see that
they're creating a huge grin

337
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,490
on the doing doubles coping with with
and then they're basically taking what

338
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:57,740
is

339
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,420
inside the attributes but you can find
here and throw the whole thing

340
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,100
into the front room instructor and
throwing a string into the function

341
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,530
construct and executing it

342
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,329
is the same thing as a naval so

343
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,679
well we haven't even again and maybe
people know it may be that would only be

344
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,819
people don't like even try to avoid evil
in their applications but there it is

345
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,309
again

346
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,549
so the framework reintroduced and had a
look at Cannes JS

347
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,260
and was the same thing re-list the using
this template in containers

348
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,839
on the Callington them text DJs my place

349
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,380
and been I started to write some code in
a realize that they have really really

350
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,520
weird ways

351
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,610
accepting calls if Wrexham for example
except arm

352
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,340
operators in their code but don't really
exist in javascript

353
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,820
so they seem to be having a purse or
something just like ending you operators

354
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,250
which is also interesting

355
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,169
and you can see that already looks
injection if some breaking of something

356
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,890
that's completely non working code but

357
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,179
in this framework it works you break up
their own logic and then again you

358
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,900
execute JavaScript

359
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,890
and had a look at why they did this once
again it but that's not what was going

360
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,320
on

361
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,530
they eat actually created a copy of evil

362
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,799
and wrapped it in to function as got my
evil and then they called my evil again

363
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,390
with his weird things like

364
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,080
again another and the interesting why
are these people are using able

365
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,410
aunt man had a look at our Kendo UI
which

366
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,450
is arm released by the company from the
state's

367
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,610
and they went even more crazy so he
could go ahead and for example simply

368
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,630
injected development

369
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,140
and this development would have an ID
and then into this development

370
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,950
you would start the expression they just
initiating would with the hash

371
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,220
been in said that hash it's the same as
with the script element you can use the

372
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,929
execute any piece of code

373
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:43,010
and you and the whole thing and then
because the defendant if the old one

374
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,230
and this is like one of the things would
select this should not be allowed this

375
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,559
should not have you shouldn't be able to

376
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,600
give def the functionality that has
gripped element has just by using was

377
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,700
primer

378
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,240
and of course they also used ever Anaka
Pocan and one of the bigger targets was

379
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,250
actually angularjs because it was huge

380
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,710
and was complex and was hard to
understand because many concepts

381
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,250
have been changed and many conservative
respond Bangla Jason you really have to

382
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,030
get into the modem

383
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,039
understandings roemer and I had a look

384
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,460
Ananda up with this little proof of
concept thing okay we import thing the

385
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,960
JS

386
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,049
and then we have a diff and we give this
to the class

387
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,990
I'm sick last in G minor step turning
the container into liquor

388
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,480
Angela and then we just simply go ahead
and say look opening curly opening curly

389
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
constructor constructor run prints is
closing curly cause injury

390
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,039
across the different we have another
JavaScript execution only that be get

391
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,150
the award twice

392
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,260
so it's to alerts that are coming out on
a real oh maybe one for security maybe

393
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,200
one for safety

394
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,320
but they do this and I followed you can
even go ahead and cook the stuff so you

395
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,200
can have a diff

396
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,150
in your injection that this div class
and GF and then the encoded

397
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,750
representation of the girlies it would
still work

398
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,830
because at that point the primary
actually take the inner text property or

399
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,260
the text content property

400
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,510
and this property in the dawn
automatically d coats so this is

401
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,260
equivalent

402
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,799
in a way misled you know when you will
prevent again tax assessor and coaches

403
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,419
stuff no

404
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,880
not not in this world that you miss you
were

405
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,100
on how many of you guys know this
constructor construct a trick

406
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,480
because this thing is important and this
is kind of marking

407
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,830
one of the new woody for cross-site
scripting victors the church using your

408
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,679
tests

409
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,870
because what this remix do was probably
obviously heavily using if I'll

410
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,980
and the go-ahead to these templates to
these expressions the grip the value

411
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,350
and then they executed in some sort of
scope so

412
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,159
usually they're checking in some sort of
object whether the scope is being

413
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:33,690
applied

414
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,000
with his rival the to developments to
put so there's an object me

415
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,630
usually have an excess or to the subject
so if you wanna have

416
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,960
write code execution from a plane object
in javascript we can take the object

417
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,049
and we can ask for its constructor and
then we get the construct of the object

418
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,330
that could be object or could be string

419
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,390
or could be something else depending on
how the book the code

420
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,169
and if you take for example the second
constructor if you ask for the first

421
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,770
constructor and get back object

422
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,480
then you ask again for the constructor
of the subject and you could function

423
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,970
and the function constructors actually
acting like an evil

424
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,760
so we can in fancy a fun trip
constructor you can pass the parameter

425
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,940
you can execute the result and then you
have a string to God

426
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,020
this is where we're using this and I had
to look at the code want to find out

427
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,480
arm what they are doing internally and
of course there's another

428
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,500
even to go here Oracle for each there's
a string that has been built up

429
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,650
strings being filled with stuff and the
throat into the function construct and

430
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,130
we have

431
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,659
good execution the greasepaint about
like 10 years of teaching developers

432
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,070
that evil is bad

433
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,510
and then the hip JavaScript members are
coming from reintroducing them yet but

434
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,890
we do do so let's look at the list back

435
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,840
great on I had a very lengthy discussion
with

436
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,059
the arm negligence developers because a
reported those box

437
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,120
and they won a Brit to be about this and
didn't know the section on security box

438
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,940
because no one would ever injected like
we would anyone ever do that it's like

439
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,120
min maybe have to remind them let's talk
about this

440
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,490
and then be treated like a discussion
talkin was like several days that has

441
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,970
been to talk to them next to explain the
way this is Dax

442
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,700
and by this is problems and I really
like this one statement

443
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,490
which is kind of going to view it is
that why shouldn't be a billiard include

444
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,260
expressions wise for the security hole

445
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,070
I do not remember you tell me are you
can follow this discussion that's linked

446
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,780
in this life

447
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,159
and commercials little bit the
development of what we've been through

448
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,440
this whole process

449
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,020
but anyway on eventually they realize
that it might indeed be attacks and that

450
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,100
you can fix them

451
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,610
and the funny enough some days later
when we had this discussion they were

452
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,360
like very convinced that it's not a
security block

453
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,990
you human from Berlin found annexes ass

454
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,400
on WWW dot Google dot com and was
exactly using the specter

455
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,419
so even on the main tumhain they had
about that was using these techniques to

456
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:49,840
kinda realization that would indeed be
about the pics that they did was

457
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,620
brilliant was a really good fix

458
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,750
armaments can talk about this
constructive thing this is the fix

459
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,760
for the Bach and the sticks keeps us
from being able to

460
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,690
execute arbitrary code with this crazy
statements because they make an object

461
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,870
check they say look ok am getting an
object

462
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,970
and I wanna find out whether the object
and its own constructor

463
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,530
is the same because when this is the
case the must be the function

464
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,360
constructor

465
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,299
missus only the case for the function
construct from you cannot get your own

466
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,909
place like this check is always going to
work if you worked with the front

467
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:20,690
Reconstructor

468
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,400
little bit you for bringing this
functionality is that you can pass and

469
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,140
function constructor anymore and abuse
that

470
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,659
it's quite nice on there's other ways to
fix this if you're deep into JavaScript

471
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,289
you can for example you set on property
or stuff like that

472
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:35,450
depending on how your friend was built
but this fixable like you can do

473
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,049
something about it as a developer

474
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,419
and as a friend would maintain a rally
none of them so far did except for

475
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:41,850
angular

476
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,450
and Amber on and there's big problem

477
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,809
and this problem was called issues P
content security policy

478
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:53,929
Cespedes quite awesome and really you
really really makes the attackers life

479
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:58,159
hard because he is P basically gives you
is a website on the possibility

480
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,110
to deploy HTTP headers that will then
instruct the browser tool not

481
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,370
execute anything lightly anymore but
only execute certain scripts

482
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,440
sir scripts that trust that strips the
coming from what was that the main

483
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,400
liberal also take away the possibility
of foreign to go to for example create

484
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,159
an open channel

485
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,700
so it's like a two component security
solution that says no interest at

486
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,220
scripts

487
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,750
and even if you get something running in
the open channel two different remained

488
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,580
leave a lot calmer something that that
was blocked and you cannot extricate the

489
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,039
data so it's not really a pain in the
ass

490
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,950
on a big problem is but most of the jobs
promote you control frameworks will not

491
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,679
work

492
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,460
alongside Cespedes absolutely not
possible because they as we just saw

493
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,270
all IOU's about or the front room
instructor and in CSP

494
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,299
evil and the function construct and
several other ways of turning cause

495
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,770
brings into cold are forbidden

496
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,820
are being blocked the possible to get
you try to use a bowl

497
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,010
but no you shall not deny for bit this
and your code is broken

498
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,070
so are not supposed to resemble any more
but all the same issues about

499
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,960
and so they won group C SP anymore so on
the one hand you have like this high and

500
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,360
security military mechanism

501
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,130
on the up the other hand 50 high and
frameworks but they were brought

502
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,690
together

503
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,950
and that is a problem and I think we
recognize this problem and they build in

504
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,159
remote into Angela JS that is capable of
dealing with Cespedes

505
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,090
so you can have an energy is application
that is very high and

506
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,880
and you can at the same time UCSB
there's even a reason for that because

507
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,039
Google is recommending annual JS

508
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,630
for or chrome extension and for prom
packaged apps and the in for Cespedes

509
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,990
so you can get your aunties p.m. these
absolute and you can kind of kind of

510
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,570
lower the security level of fees and
stuff like that so must work together

511
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,340
and the way they're doing is actually
quite smart man who look at how this

512
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,419
works

513
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:45,500
arm its kind of magic but when you think
about it

514
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,559
it actually isn't actually quite clear
how they did this and by this works

515
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,049
and the it said to be a little bit
slower because

516
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:56,460
evil is actually quite fast and the
country's able to the few something else

517
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,929
so people are reporting about 30 percent
slower maybe it's even less meanwhile

518
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:04,100
but in the end it enables languages
occasions to work

519
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,820
in combination with a very good security
mechanism that the CSP and that is that

520
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,179
this

521
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,120
that's pretty crazy that is pretty good
pretty nice for developers but idk also

522
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,570
is kind of a breach in logic because in
a way

523
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,690
the spring spec script injections you
must select my

524
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,700
why would that be the case let's have a
look on

525
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,490
here we see a very simple website and
its deploying all the possible to use P

526
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,320
Henderson

527
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,299
deploying three of them because not all
brothers except the same headers yet but

528
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,150
it's kind of

529
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,799
almost ready for Kronos almost to the
brothers are using condom and security

530
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,610
policy

531
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,500
but back then we need a dollar them to
have a break for all brothers to

532
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,299
conceive header

533
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,419
X minus content security policy and
default source

534
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:46,610
a self so the best third in the brothers
being instructed

535
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,950
to only execute script but it's coming
from resources that are on the same two

536
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,350
main anything else can not be executed

537
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,929
event enlist on work arm inline script
doesn't work

538
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,539
only script that was coming from the
very same domain which is quite secure

539
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:00,260
images

540
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,600
leaving the attacker with the situation
of having to do more than just a simple

541
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,820
injection

542
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,900
we've doctype then we have national
element we have the

543
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,230
engine men's up but as clearing the old
document as being and replication

544
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,309
then we have an extra to do that is
called engine minus ESP

545
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,770
and this enables the application to run
sees P mode which is

546
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,149
as much different mode and then we have
like the gorilla Man 3

547
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:26,020
to you including you itself we close the
thing we have a body

548
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,730
and you're in the body we have an
injection like a nocturnal injection and

549
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,880
the attacker just injected the spike it
for a minute or something like that

550
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,659
and would expect but if you click on the
body

551
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,700
after this code has been injected but of
course there's going to be an alert

552
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,120
however there is no willard because CSP

553
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,899
suppresses that missus pieces like no no
contenders i cant

554
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,399
allow you to do that so I'm just gonna
do anything at all you could look at the

555
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,690
Consul morning till you

556
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,799
no just work however nugs is kinda
special

557
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,370
and it has own event enters ands those

558
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,010
are being prefixed with NG minus you can
for example just go ahead and say

559
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,440
engine miners most over and then do
something

560
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,140
and this means the technically you can
inject stuff

561
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,640
but not classic event honors anymore
which would inject this actually

562
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,940
framerate functionality so the attacker
would just have to inject engine miners

563
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,370
click

564
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,740
or and humans more mom almost over in
still supposed to work because otherwise

565
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,620
the framework for break apart

566
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,220
know the interesting parts which kind of
have and scope inside this

567
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,110
expression inside the temple expression
because with the English people offer do

568
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,750
here

569
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,330
was a reference to the actual event
object that is being available or made

570
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,480
available by using donor event

571
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,779
and who knows who knows the event object
in the DOM

572
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:46,940
because they have like a very very nice
property every event object

573
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,260
that you have in the DOM always leak the
window object

574
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,350
with a rival view so they have one
property that is called you in that

575
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,460
contains window

576
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,630
and if you have Windows if the entire
web application and you have are a true

577
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,360
script execution again

578
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,480
so all that was necessary here with the
silica can we expect the rear

579
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,399
accessing event better than existing you
the existing number two

580
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,549
that we have four blocks from execution
again and see is peacefully bypassed

581
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:13,010
by the library and by the extra
functionality that the library its

582
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,340
to the DOM into the brosser which is
quite interesting

583
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,210
on and the the questions like how do
they how did they do this this kind of

584
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,620
magic how are they

585
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,029
able to bypass a technology that is like
deeply seated deeply rooted in the

586
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,880
browser

587
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,179
and keeps the browser from executing
anything that is in line hope that the

588
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,419
for the cat across this in addition a
bit hard because with the anger people

589
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,899
are doing is they have a parser

590
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,450
and if you have a parcel than you can do
a lot of things and they actually just

591
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,710
powers over the content of the NG
attributes

592
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,309
and the grip the first part of it which
people example

593
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,399
the stream event and then the group the
second part of it in the third part so

594
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:50,460
this pleaded by the dot

595
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,789
and have like an array of strings the to
go over

596
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:58,049
and they basically passing through the
engines elect okay we have something

597
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:00,350
here that is the string dollar event

598
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:05,350
do have something in Scopus alter names
like this if so I'll return it

599
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,240
and keep using it and then they go to
the next part of the streets a local

600
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,980
band we have something that is called
view

601
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,799
but after that we just got doesn't have
a few if so return it

602
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,070
and move on if not aboard execution and
then we are inside the window and they

603
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,630
just legal there there's a string that
is called convert 1

604
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,720
and did we have an important window and
yes of course we do

605
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,270
so they can just like return it and then
executed and %uh this is the entire

606
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,370
magical they do this in Holly bypasses
be at this point

607
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,799
because technically not in line if
actually fully legitimate

608
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,460
and but its work and no evil as the you
see the disperse the stuff and then

609
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,669
check references return the references
execute the thing in the end and done

610
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:46,919
very nice but that also means that
enabling a javascript love you control a

611
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,830
framework to be working together with
the SP

612
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,409
also bypasses the SP so you kind of
don't need to use P anymore and this is

613
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,149
kind of weird

614
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,289
because if this program is X providing
event enders and you

615
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,480
reload them then my to give the
protection and even

616
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,860
but yeah arm

617
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,299
I actually contacted them we talked
about this and they fix some parts of it

618
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,450
so this is good

619
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,909
but it was thinking maybe we can do more
and maybe we can kind of leave the

620
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:17,330
boring conduct the web applications no
was good luck stupid alert and stuff

621
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,820
like that maybe there's something else
that can be run and removing a GS we can

622
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,730
cause more damage just for the fun these

623
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,809
and then a discover packaged at scrum
picture may actually quite amazing and

624
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:30,110
on the website it says package shipped
deliver an experience as capable as a

625
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,340
native app

626
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,000
but as safe as a web page which is this
really got no

627
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,080
essay for the perpetually wet pictures
have proven to be so safe in the past

628
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,769
but it's over the web page just like Rep
ups package separate management 5

629
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,570
JavaScript and CSS

630
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,760
okay so there's something kind of app
thing but to run somewhere

631
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,230
and then it can do little things but
it's essentially built in 2005

632
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:55,090
JavaScript will turn up on and then it
suspects after

633
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:59,140
x2 chrome APIs and service is not
available traditional web sites

634
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,330
you can be a powerful taps the direct
with the network and hardware devices

635
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,309
media tools and much more

636
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:08,760
singers like okay so you have like this
execution environment and its use an

637
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,159
external and JavaScript

638
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,409
but then again in Cannock excessive
devices and a camera and

639
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:17,950
your USB devices other than that it's
that is interesting

640
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,320
and the good thing is from Unitech
rivers a text point of view

641
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,460
that are on the documentation who
recommends

642
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,299
to use angular JS for the youth

643
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,570
with compact so it's okay we we actually
have like a bunch of

644
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,600
levy extensions you that you can just
the crap and play with

645
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,309
and the over with English JS so that
means that

646
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,720
technically you can apply all the same
attacks that you can use against web

647
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,870
sites was English jazz against these
pictures

648
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,080
and the the picture of themselves have a
very strong security model because

649
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,080
the in foresees peak you can't to
anything

650
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,049
to turn it off like it has to be there
like it's it's fixed you cannot get

651
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:00,880
around this

652
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,080
this is of course making projections
against apps very very hard because

653
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,039
injections would

654
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,090
projects acute goat coming from the
outside and see if people to block it so

655
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,019
whatever injected gonna work

656
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:15,010
however since those things are using a
eulogy if that means that we can maybe

657
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,029
combined the so we can maybe combine the
functionality of angular Jess bypassing

658
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:20,440
CSB

659
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,640
and thereby taken extension and a
privilege good execution

660
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,950
and this actually works so let's have a
look at the quick example and

661
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,120
the this is basically the outline like
TV structure of a very very simple demo

662
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,549
app so we see your doctor X Milan gf and
uses P we get the angular day as we get

663
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,539
the comptroller Rita Patel cheats

664
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:41,789
and you have some kind of 22 thing that
is doing stuff in showing items

665
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,120
nothing very nothing more specific you
receive the controller code

666
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,370
that is composed an angular GSM select
to controller and dust off as a school

667
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,730
project and

668
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,500
justice and that's that fair enough and
then we see the manifest that is

669
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,190
basically

670
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,909
defining the properties in the meditator
North security properties for

671
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:03,450
the extension for the package to happen
again we see there's nothing spectacular

672
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,049
and your man first person to

673
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,079
arm the thing is the name some
permissions his aversion

674
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,159
looked in the transcripts and that's it
in no way is to manage action

675
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,869
insulin injection that we have that
would technically not work because it

676
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,450
would have to be in javascript

677
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,169
but your we know this is the attacker
miss a ride to the beach is gonna inject

678
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:25,589
and logistical and the injection a sears
is like Angie minus click

679
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:29,679
and get interesting because then we have
something that is like an invalid non

680
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,879
existing functional

681
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,339
it starts here and answer

682
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:38,510
and what I'm doing and he resembles the
doing some donor semantics here in San

683
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,119
MW equal to confuse them

684
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,240
obviously kind of grabbing window than
creating a new element in the AM sending

685
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,389
this thing to summer I'll

686
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:48,589
leading data so whatever day to the
application contains and displaced I'm

687
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,050
leaking into the October

688
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,570
and the interesting thing is that
angular JS or the parser a finger JS

689
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,829
and that version for bid you to use
assignments

690
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,880
your template inspections are you
couldn't go ahead and select equal to be

691
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,480
there was forbidden from ever

692
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,570
over if we could take the whole thing
and rapid 22 function call a function

693
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,540
that didn't exist

694
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,010
an abrupt and there's more demand for
that so that's a look

695
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,829
I hope this works arm

696
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:17,770
this is the lows were from and you re

697
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,790
the demo extension and

698
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,440
you basically assume that the injection
already happened I have the source code

699
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,450
of that right here

700
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,520
you can see here's our injection

701
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,940
and what I'm doing right now is starting
this thing and checking if the injector

702
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,329
JavaScript is actually executing its
coming through

703
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:38,320
what I'm doing here is sending this
stuff to my books and basically

704
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,450
seeing something arrives

705
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,079
this and 30 extension

706
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,190
Paris you can cross chrome organs moved
away because it needed more

707
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,570
just like rough around here and click
and oh there's another kitten

708
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,589
so for me something happen something
with egypt court worked

709
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:00,400
and I can have a look at my locker and
CEO there's a lot of stuff in base64

710
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,030
which is effectively the entire mark-up
and the entire time of the application

711
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,130
just in a string representation

712
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,220
and I can start looking deeper work with
that an attacker

713
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,520
so we can infect injects

714
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,750
arbitrary code into the extension

715
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,990
in case it's using a glittery as because
we have the possibility to use

716
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,710
injections again despite these p

717
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,980
and that it's quite nice and the kind of
got me hooked and had a closer look at

718
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,410
this

719
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,450
arm and there's much more to find on

720
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:32,000
one thing that I really liked is this
thing here

721
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,250
so essentially says def class and Angie
minus including the

722
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,700
use something that looks you relish and
that actually does something

723
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,089
so energy is already emulates the
feature a fictional imports and gives

724
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:47,260
you the possibility to fetch

725
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,450
HTML from a different domain or any
different place

726
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,900
get it back from that place months it's
available

727
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,119
and then put it into your own website so
HTML know has important includes

728
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,839
not sure if that's a good idea but this
little piece of code already

729
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,450
excuse for lunch I was good because it
pulling markup from the domain who don't

730
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,869
PW which I actually own and put into
europe

731
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:13,010
so if you can get this injection through
and the website that you eject

732
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,320
into is using the GS then you have a
bypass and then you have something that

733
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,980
is only using the class attribute

734
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,750
and nobody nobody for dessert with the
classic because classes harms

735
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:27,680
anyway on I was thinking the maybe I can
turn this into a difference is P bypass

736
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,140
based on this particular future

737
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,250
and actually works and as the final
attack that we're gonna see today and

738
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:32,829
the stock

739
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:37,119
on ended assumes that we have three
conditions given

740
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,089
we have a website the bedford is using
angular JS

741
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:45,160
the group that has an injection but it
features everything that is harmful to

742
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,820
go to the script X

743
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,380
iframes event and was like everything
that you would filter

744
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,500
in the regular website for security
purposes perfectly fit

745
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,790
however it does allow you to use HTML
like div class and stuff like that but

746
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,420
because

747
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,060
I wouldn't it and the third precondition
we have to have on this website we have

748
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,589
to be able to upload a file

749
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:07,349
summer like to do for avatar image or
something like that or document

750
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:10,410
so we have to be able to control some
content of what is residing on the

751
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,380
server

752
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,810
and with the upload and the combination
of

753
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,750
a GS and some action if I features

754
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,560
we can even get if Reese's PB a possible
that so even if the best that is running

755
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,500
very very strict use P we can still make
an injection

756
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,070
and still execute arbitrary code and
still eager to the Auto Mart

757
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,619
a little book arm years like the kind of
a map

758
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,320
of what the tech is actually doing
because if a show you the attack ads

759
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,210
family and spectacular and some really
doing anything except for showing the

760
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,020
good ordered one just like yet another
19

761
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,420
so we kinda wanna see why the alert
comes and Eurydice

762
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,839
goes the tournament arm so we upload a
picture

763
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:54,230
and I think this is some I don't know I
don't know who this is

764
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,490
and I think I think it's Baltimore

765
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,880
not and he likes to dance and be up with
this picture

766
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,130
and every look at the source of the
picture we see that some

767
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,730
something fishing is going on and
something something weird is in here

768
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,190
so we see the gym 264 Jeff

769
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,390
says give you sick a node

770
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,579
so we have a diff --git for this Jeff
and we see that there's the classic

771
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,220
interviews the first magic bites as the
Giff

772
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,290
8980 and then we have something in Zante
equals mun

773
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,930
and then at some point we're having like
stuff again that indicate that an actual

774
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:30,750
image

775
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,880
and then again we have some HW so

776
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,270
the crazy part here is that

777
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,650
we want to create in a blow to give that

778
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,390
is a valid give and develop JavaScript

779
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,320
and develop is a bitch email at the same
time so everybody loves to millions

780
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,859
right now in this is classically
wannabes chameleons

781
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,119
so if you take this gif an object
reloaded

782
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,829
and we'll tell you just I have
dimensions I'm pretty big but I have to

783
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:56,320
mention

784
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,380
I'm bill it's a look confused here

785
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,460
alert so this is what the diff is
looking like a legit

786
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,270
and you can also see your like all the
other stuff isn't your on the weird

787
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,220
things

788
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,609
and if we just display it she's heard if
you just display it

789
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,430
click on it we can see yes we feed it to
some image library in the middle overs

790
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,500
as love you that's perfectly valid and
has like

791
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,980
with 15,000 pixel and height of pro 1000
pixels so

792
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,670
songster minutes BB and you should
cannot get suspicious when you see such

793
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,160
a big if but

794
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,369
it's still a village know what's
happening is

795
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,619
we uploaded and we have all the stuff in
here

796
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,420
would be then do is we use the injection
that we have on the website like the

797
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,270
harms Ajmal injection and we inject the
string

798
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:46,260
span class equals Angie minus include
and the point for that gif

799
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,290
that instructs angular JS to request
that

800
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,710
if to prep its contents and put the
conduct in the DOM

801
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,170
that's nice because technically we could
just like with any other true JavaScript

802
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:57,980
into that give

803
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,750
and get executed but we mustn't forget
that we're still having to deal with the

804
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,069
website that is perfectly sees P
protected

805
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:08,020
so we can just execute arbitrary
JavaScript we need to execute something

806
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,069
special

807
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:12,069
and that is exactly what we doing here
so we have

808
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,230
this ban that is having the class that
is using the engine to the describing

809
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,849
the image

810
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:19,000
and then displaying its content now
would be making of

811
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,150
you have a woman making use of your is a
special feature that is called

812
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,390
that is already implemented and drums
nightly and has to be enabled perfect

813
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,260
and that is extremely imports the
current specifying that there's a lot of

814
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,589
discussions about that

815
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:32,760
but the actual imports a very powerful
because then of course

816
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,859
can also import themselves and they can
also be used in combination with enraged

817
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:37,390
email

818
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,920
which is being used for this
functionality is a this request the

819
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,599
image

820
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,849
and then writes the content of that
image back to enrich the mail this has

821
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:46,670
this to appear in the website which is
the actual import

822
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,940
which is then again proving itself and
then grabbing the style element of the

823
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,640
script element

824
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,859
displaying the script element in the
website which is then again

825
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:59,390
requesting itself so first we fixed the
image damages including itself it's

826
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,170
again including itself but always in a
different context

827
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,550
and this final step years basically
saying script source tells gif

828
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,790
an activating the alert but I have
hidden inside to give

829
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,140
so its community here he with magic
bites and

830
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,740
basically we need to make sure that the
content of the file as both fell a

831
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,569
javascript and both will it give

832
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:22,329
so we turn this whole thing into labor
laws that give 8980 equals 1

833
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:25,920
the JavaScript to restart a comment and
said to give head area

834
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,530
we and the comment we at the actual
payload that we want to be executed with

835
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,480
JavaScript

836
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,790
we create another comment we go up to
here

837
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,200
then reenter the actual payload of the
cute like the actual pics information

838
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,119
which is here

839
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,150
which is still inside the JavaScript
comment so we can have in there whatever

840
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,099
we want

841
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:45,170
and we and the comment down here in in
to be also if the link

842
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,369
so first with this thing be fetched then
it's including itself a link

843
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:52,740
than its including itself a script the
executing its ok because it has the

844
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,160
continent's like 35 comments at the same
time

845
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,569
so and that's it that's the attack on

846
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:02,050
I reporters back into guys this is not
so cool because it's turning every

847
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:02,940
single harmless

848
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,790
Ajmal injection even if these peas onto
something really nasty

849
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,540
if there's any possibility to influence
any file but that machine on the domain

850
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,210
because then we have bypassed the router

851
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,410
bypass the brother by successful bidders
the service in Texas as voters

852
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,890
CSP and all of the protection mechanisms
are not birth

853
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,099
anything at all and i can reply in there
was a bit sad because it said

854
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,660
it looks like we'll disagree to disagree
we'll agree to disagree on the

855
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,710
importance of the Asian imports issue we
don't think it's possible for her party

856
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,940
to execute arbitrators good for the
process to describe

857
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,550
so the risk of continued as a channel
would be the one that the delivery was

858
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,930
taking on deliberately

859
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,000
and I don't certainly I don't understand
agree on that

860
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,440
and we were talking about to fix and
there's the possibility for a fix but so

861
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,010
far I'm it has not been implemented yet
so let's see

862
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,079
to right now you can start playing with
us

863
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,960
on and there's like another issue that
is pretty crazy arm

864
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,410
two years ago I was talking about night
you 1 year ago was talking about an

865
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,930
attack that is called an excess

866
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,369
thats takes into consideration that the
DOM sometimes transforms

867
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:05,180
and you take stuff is happening on a Web
site and

868
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,849
this was the same situation with English
GS and this is another and fix doc

869
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:12,589
because what you can do is you can use
the engine includes to fetch fights

870
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:16,520
and if you have an injection that is
encoded and part of his inclusion

871
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,550
then interesting thing happens upon
angular parsing over the stuff

872
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,750
and putting into the website because
this is a sin krone's

873
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,460
and for a synchronic operations a
JavaScript library doesn't always know

874
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,550
where it was

875
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,349
and the word still has to go in terms of
the country so what they do is they

876
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:34,460
create some kind of small bread crumbs

877
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,010
and the Creative Commons inside the dome
to remind themselves where they were

878
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:38,920
with the parser

879
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,930
even was nice and transaction so what
they do is they create comments in the

880
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,480
comment

881
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,490
con pains parts of the state of you

882
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,930
and they throw it into the function that
is called document create comment

883
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,300
and the beautiful thing with the
commentariat comment is that if not

884
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,020
where

885
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,420
if the comet itself is closing itself
through you could use for example the

886
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,290
dash dash greater than inside

887
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,220
the parameter for this function: and
then the comment that you create has

888
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,619
already close itself

889
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,640
and that is exactly what's happening
here so then the method to the dawn and

890
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,470
the only thing you have to do is mutated
in original ones

891
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,690
with whatever trick you can use for that
and then have another another

892
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,890
possess however this does not buy passes
be

893
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,970
on this is just like a small smile
tricked you can use

894
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,180
so rivers mall recap about this would be
seen so far as we've seen a bunch of

895
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,490
libraries the two crazy stuff

896
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,359
and that was like right market really
because they think it's a good at you to

897
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:32,369
actually extend HTML be smarter than the
specified hours and two more

898
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:36,339
band The Brothers supposed to do we've
seen JavaScript execution that is coming

899
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:37,690
straight from better at reviews

900
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:41,560
I was persecution from retreat elements
like a diff and kendo

901
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,430
I was good execution with inkatha
mustaches wanna read note waffled on CSP

902
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,410
bypasses one of them already fixed

903
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,160
and we've seen the reasons for these
which is basically people using about

904
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,319
an interesting thing is just the tip of
the iceberg because there's many

905
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,050
many live resort there and many of them
I use have frequently and many of them

906
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,839
use it well and have a lot of bad coding
practices

907
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,359
on this is a teacher that I got at the
developer conference in Norway

908
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:07,760
and it kinda says evil just look in a
black metal way

909
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,369
I from the slicks ok was the kind of
perfectly catching the Spurs

910
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:15,050
arm another problem that we see in the
wild

911
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,190
this even if there's fixes in this
library's

912
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,210
than doesn't mean at all the developers
of the use

913
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,890
the fixed versions of the live religious
go with the old one because the problem

914
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,480
is that

915
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,560
many of the spencer libros actually
break API's again with a new minorities

916
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,540
but it's gonna totally break the API

917
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,400
so whenever you want update you have to
change accord that support shit I mean

918
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,810
that's

919
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:38,210
something you can't do and that is
moralist the reason why you can see that

920
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,839
the majority of web site that are using
an alleged are still stuck with version

921
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:42,859
1.0.1

922
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:46,950
the use on the 21 there too and so on a
bunch of them are anyone's arrayed

923
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,510
but none of them is running want well
one to

924
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,760
18 which is the most recent one
meanwhile for your

925
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,300
so adjusted to the old stuff the status
by the way love it because the cure

926
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,819
you can see book was about this on
anything when learning that we can pull

927
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,970
from this is that's

928
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,650
sugaring you mark up in extending what
saddam supposed to do in which members

929
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,440
opposed to do can be very dangerous and
security context we shouldn't lose

930
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,680
but the question is how can we put this
into metric okay with you write

931
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,589
something that is actually general
usable for people out there and you for

932
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:17,339
developers

933
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:20,349
or pen to those who want to find out
which is the good news

934
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:23,460
through a credit small leaky on Google
coat

935
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,599
and I credit the metric to be able to
measure the security features or

936
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,710
security

937
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,960
properties of the JavaScript frameworks
and because it sounds cooler decided to

938
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,599
call the next ashtec

939
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:38,130
okay and this especially a would be the
question are the temp reading

940
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,900
expressions equivalent to JavaScript
about

941
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,359
if yes fail because that mustn't be if
no good

942
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:47,990
some primitive know and they win they're
sick be is the executions global

943
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,410
isolated or sandbox so do I have the
possibility to break out the scope

944
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,579
that the framework is dictating and get
back to window

945
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:58,910
if that is the case fail if it's not the
case nicely done

946
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,619
win and so on until two special sexyy

947
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:05,780
just asking does the free movement in
every security program

948
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,559
some do some don't arm J crew people
mean when I really hate us because we

949
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,730
got in on them and

950
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,640
after that we selected just like we try
to contact you but you don't have a

951
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,170
security at jcrew.com address know they
do

952
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,730
Peyton Hillis anomalies we have special
F

953
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,710
asking with the framework is capable of
dealing with these be or not because if

954
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,660
it's not

955
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,890
intended to use that did not search and
seize the which is a bad thing for your

956
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,290
website

957
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:33,589
and we created the rekey and in this
week EU basically have

958
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:38,170
all the tech sector's that I was already
showing and significantly more because

959
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,270
artists altogether 13 libraries with
everything could be in place ready

960
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:46,130
so you just can't but the possibly to go
to this place and for example say him my

961
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,700
website is using

962
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,640
you jerry is for example and you want to
find out hope you chase performs

963
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,250
fields in every regard and you have a
bunch for example snippets that show how

964
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,420
you execute JavaScript

965
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,730
and then you have abrasions on that and
the reason for that and you see where

966
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,260
the records are broken

967
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,609
and that the records likes completely
broken the for example try to

968
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,640
Mitch unique code with only decibels
which is

969
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,960
doomed and so on and then you have to
this from the culturing you where the

970
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,650
box its

971
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,890
and what the fuck does and for the
victors look like it's a super angler JS

972
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,160
were even started to spread by versions
anna koch et

973
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,270
your is the example victors from the
older versions

974
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:26,650
serious example Victor some newer
versions example Victor Susan cashing

975
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,829
using template thing and so on to all of
this is copy and paste ready if you

976
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:30,880
wanna tested

977
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,079
and all the victors are all too ready
for you that you could just like go out

978
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,339
at this to your

979
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:40,520
repertoire vectors answer working with
them and you might find fresh box

980
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,450
so arm that is already the end of the
talking we can

981
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:48,430
reached a conclusion I do believe that

982
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,359
JavaScript love you control frameworks
require a new security program when we

983
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,000
go

984
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,240
some stupid the required you security
requirements because they break certain

985
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,210
security problems that were formally
given that we need to rethink certain

986
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,720
things because some stuff that was
formerly not

987
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,250
possibly execute a bill know all of a
sudden it's

988
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,359
on one thing that you need to put in
mind or keep in mind when you're a

989
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,480
developer that you cannot

990
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,490
ever have reflected content from the
server: ever again

991
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,190
like this kind of thing that you add
something to the URL nachos and your

992
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,809
website you can't have that anymore

993
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,390
because if that has been picked up by
the framerate you have a problem that

994
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,809
you can fix

995
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:25,030
so you have to isolate your stuff you
have to separate your stuff you have to

996
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,010
put everything into template containers
and make sure that the data is really

997
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,630
separated from the content

998
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,470
and this is like actually the small
glimpse of hope that isn't here

999
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,309
because those framerate at least make it
too easy two separate content

1000
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:40,900
and to separate the entities that are
driving or that are making a web app

1001
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,180
and that was not the case from early so
maybe there is like a good chance that

1002
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,109
cross site scripting has been implicitly
fix but people who are using these

1003
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:48,790
frameworks and using them right

1004
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,550
because then there is no surface anymore
like the entire exercise surfaces moral

1005
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,430
is gone

1006
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,579
unless they do something really really
wrong on the server

1007
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:59,950
so well maybe we have a chance to
actually see progress on this and

1008
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,630
realize that it's killing X as

1009
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,790
although it doesn't really have this in
mind and there is a kind of a positive

1010
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,359
aspect

1011
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,800
on and I think there's like alone a
superfluous be done so

1012
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,230
aid the asthma research we can do be the
freemen authors need to apply to more

1013
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,420
coding good practices and not his worst
practices that the using right now

1014
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,390
because this function construct to use
the

1015
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,400
shit like they shouldn't do this it's
not a good idea

1016
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,130
on we have a lot of new technologies
coming up I heard that will start is no

1017
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,119
working with templates as well I haven't
had a look at this yet we have the

1018
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,849
components coming up soon

1019
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:32,510
we have the polymer frame it produces
extremely interesting if you like

1020
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,619
JavaScript management have a look at
this thing

1021
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:37,950
with the shadow government that is
coming up custom HTML elements that are

1022
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,579
coming up there's a lot of traction
under

1023
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:43,290
moment in the sector and dusts
consequently we also have few security

1024
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:43,950
promises

1025
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,589
and a few security flaws and we as
prentice urs need to adjust to this and

1026
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:48,720
we need to realize

1027
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,819
that the classic stuff like the classic
injection box they're fading away

1028
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:52,980
they're going away

1029
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,660
and we need to realize but this new
injection back to be confronted with

1030
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,099
and that for example this constructor
constructor trick is true something that

1031
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:01,180
we might be able

1032
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,200
to use daily at some point on a daily
basis and web site because more mirth

1033
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,020
and supports convert X let's see what's
going on how this develops and this is

1034
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,980
basically a statement or

1035
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,030
if you're new questions appreciate
otherwise very much and

1036
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:18,650
by here
