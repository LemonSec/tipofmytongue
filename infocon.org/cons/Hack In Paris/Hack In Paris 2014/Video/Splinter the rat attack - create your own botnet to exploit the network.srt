1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,159
ok excellent okay so looks like we'll
just start

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:06,270
right now why not um when when

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,370
I is in the back so we have our public
service announcements I think

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,490
a set up waiting 15 minutes we'll just
start the debate five minutes after

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,029
I think that's when the alcohol and beer
will be in so I will be happy or so

6
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,029
buddy okay so um enough about so

7
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,400
thank you all so much I'm Solomon sonya
and

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,769
it's a pleasure to honors a blessing to
be here in front of everyone

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,570
I'm here so I've had a good time working
on splinter and hopefully

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,570
I'm will be able to learn something as
we progress through the slides together

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,500
so first I to stop with the obligatory
disclaimer

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,739
just saying that some use the knowledge

13
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,210
I guess that we discuss or use knowledge
in hacking things

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,430
for good user for good enough for evil
so all that text just saying

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,600
as hackers please be nights because if
you destroy someone's computer system

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,980
although I built the tall are not
responsible because

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,550
1 I've your actually execute on the
computer system simply just be say

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,720
be set in the kinds of air fair we

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,280
okay alright I'll take that as a yes so
on this is what to expect in the

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,900
following

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,290
presentation for the most part I think
you'll be obvious what we cover

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,479
just as we go from like to slide but one
important thing is that bastard

23
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,950
I our live demonstration gremlin so in
america whenever we select a crossword

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,220
with excuse our friends

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,360
so if we're in France when we say excuse
my American

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,829
well well that worked %uh I'm not sir
but just in case some any of the live

27
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,070
demonstrations fail

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,409
I'm sorry it just happens for whatever
reason to get up to you try and do a

29
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,460
demo in things fail

30
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,240
but hopefully it doesn't and if so I
have a backup laptop hopefully

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,020
everything will go

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm well from there so the research
motivation

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,229
as we know pretty much as everybody has
alluded to in the presentation that we

34
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,470
spoke about today is that

35
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,770
network security is still falling behind
to stay ahead of the emerging threats

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,710
so therefore in order to be able to be
stronger with a network security network

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,430
defense

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,719
pretty much if you want to be really
good at securing enterprise network

39
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,810
economy to know

40
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,090
exactly the in and outs of exploiting
this could this computer network so

41
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,880
that's why

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,410
I developed this botnet so if you
understand how to use a botnet

43
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,879
if you understand how to exploit
networks with botnets then perhaps you

44
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,910
have knowledge of what's a better look
for

45
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,760
in order to secure your systems in case
you see actually that's malicious

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
are active US index dipped love combine
infection so I'll

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,670
other talk about botnets what exactly is
this botnet I speak up well

48
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,879
this is our terminology that will use on
for today

49
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,140
all of this information is from the book
of Solomon I E

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,610
me so a botnet us pretty much

51
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,840
us another cover Thomas systems agents
their synchronized with the

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,110
command-and-control server

53
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,010
and which which Saint information which
stains commands and then we also handle

54
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,680
or remote

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,590
exploitation of those and systems when I
speak about the controller

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,660
the controller is us we are the
controller we are the botnet masters we

57
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,269
other person who use one

58
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,739
user interface to send commands to all
of our distributed systems

59
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,319
across the network or across the
enterprise the dropper

60
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,700
the dropper I'll we have a slight on the
droppers pretty much just saying

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,200
that's going to be one way up having an
entry points into that infected machine

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,220
and finally the implant the implant is
the listener

63
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,220
that actually establishes his connection
to the controller

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,090
executes whatever commands that we
receive and send that information right

65
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,629
back to the controllers now we have

66
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,310
arbothnott communication and then we
have other not at the bottom we want to

67
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,909
be as lightweight as possible

68
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,580
so we can establish a cell to the
controller whenever the controller sends

69
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,390
information

70
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,760
on my listeners side I simply
instantiate a new process

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,370
I executes the command that was just
received that I open

72
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,379
three streams on that process and/or its
execute commands the open your standard

73
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:43,810
out

74
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,599
a standard-bearer and then also a print
writers like correspond with that

75
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,319
process

76
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,930
any information that I get across the
standout understand that a run is

77
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,590
processed

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,129
I simply buffer that information and I
centre-backs the controller as a pretty

79
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,599
much how you establish a botnet

80
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,159
so I'm a visual learner I'm also a
teacher

81
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,319
so I kinda like to have diagrams
hopefully this helps less a lot of words

82
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,189
with my hands

83
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,709
but look at the pictures also who I know
understand what we're talking about

84
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,580
so I'm here we go right here we are the
botnet mastery other controller

85
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,419
if you understand using algorithms to
send commands to

86
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,239
wanna be infected machines received a
response from the infected machine and

87
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,790
send it back to the controller

88
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,120
if you understand how to program that
for one instance then if you can use the

89
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,540
same function to execute the commands

90
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,199
for the next incense and the next
instance after that then actually by

91
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,630
induction it means you understand how to
create

92
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,500
and how to control your button it okay
%ah very nice very nice

93
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,940
so where exactly do we begin if we're
talking about

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,759
establishing a botnet controlling
information: and controls and systems

95
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,630
well let's go ahead look at our anatomy
of an attack

96
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,669
most people are very familiar with this
you start with the reconnaissance

97
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,729
then you do you're scanning to
understand my entry points and the

98
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,680
vulnerabilities into the computer
network

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,889
and then we tryin penetrates that system
this is also refers was gaining access

100
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,680
on C one in the infected machines on the
Bonneville missy is that we were sad

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,610
access to

102
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,380
now after you gain access after you
penetrate that machine

103
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,500
and you stop you happy dance because
hacking is not as easy as as um you know

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,289
some people like to make it appear

105
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,650
so once we stop dancing cuz we just got
a shell into the computer machine

106
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,979
now we have options are we going to
escalate privileges

107
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,350
perhaps we're going to pillage and
plunder as mister della mister people

108
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,250
loose earlier

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,740
when I we have access to other sprinters
are any of those infected machines that

110
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,780
were talking about

111
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,699
or do we pay that do we actually try and
propagate I'm hour because from my

112
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,180
computer system

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,770
I'm now whenever I penetrate the network
I now have access to more systems

114
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,250
inside a separate network supply
continue to scan and then trying to take

115
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,620
more

116
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,440
more machines that way or perhaps I'm
going to just paralyzed every single

117
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
system

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,550
out there it all depends on-the-go love
your attack

119
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,680
and then after that we actually moved
down to stop the persistence and

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,750
covering tracks

121
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,500
other diagrams like to have persistence
and then cover your tracks what's up

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,940
with the other or covering tracks and
persistence

123
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,039
I put them side by side because it's
actually an iterative loop

124
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,169
and wits as I continued the attack I
like to try and yes still

125
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,660
as possible or I'd like to maintain
access so it's a

126
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,669
it's something that we go back and forth
is not just you do one and then you move

127
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,720
on

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,139
so that now that we understand are now
turning up the attack let's focus on

129
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,479
penetration

130
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,039
so earlier I alluded to the dropper I
really like the dropper implants

131
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,430
um paradigm whenever I'm technique
computer network so let's see

132
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,810
blew another pictogram so here we are we
are the controller

133
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,479
the controller we have access to a
malicious domain that we use

134
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,139
and her sis served additional malware to
infect computer machines

135
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,990
so what a dropper as soon as we have a
dropper dropper supposed to be as small

136
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,169
as possible

137
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,740
and the only purpose of the dropper
assemblies to break into that victim a

138
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,319
scene

139
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,960
and establish the environment there are
many different types droppers that can

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,830
exist I can use an exploit

141
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,169
I can use a malicious PDF I will be
using social engineering toolkit

142
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:06,509
um created by hacking Dave relic I'll
talk about that more

143
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,530
and a slice to come in which we actually
going to try and steal credentials to

144
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,419
gain access to a network

145
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,819
on that's the worst we have okay so
whenever I have my exploit my dropper

146
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,490
get into the infected machine

147
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,190
the dropper then reaches out my
malicious domain actually pulls down the

148
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,139
implant

149
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,819
that implant is what is establishment to
the infected machine now

150
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,000
and then it establishes his connection
up to the controller and from that

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,050
moment on the dropper goes away

152
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,229
and now I have my to wake a man to
control between the implant

153
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,380
and the victim a scene so now the
implant is connected to my controller

154
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,580
as we spoke about earlier stephan
persistence

155
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,560
that this is um what we call our beacon
but and the inspiration of this was

156
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,620
actually from Raphael much do we know

157
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,620
raffia much is the creator armitage okay

158
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,410
raise your hand if we use armitage
before by this we've heard about are all

159
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,620
good to excellent so there's a a pretty
good

160
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,460
I'm so can sort we're going to use
armitage is a wonderful framework very

161
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,349
very nice

162
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:04,849
origin is Metasploit Psalms actually
handle additional

163
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,979
exploitation the computer machine
Amplats at a

164
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:12,650
presentation that myself and Daryl I am
percent X we're at Packer Hall said last

165
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,250
year

166
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,090
and Armitage Raphael much he was talking
about sometimes

167
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,300
whenever you have access to a network
you don't just wanna have a

168
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,940
long-established socket connection

169
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,680
between a controller and then the
implant because this in and of itself

170
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,879
can be indicative that hey why is why do
I have one on my machines

171
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,120
having an a connection that lasted for
25 hours

172
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,589
I'm to another system why do you need a
connection established for so long

173
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,959
so instead he spoke about creating a
beacon but and you can use a beacon bus

174
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,789
to establish persistence

175
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,700
maintain access to a computer network
but without having a persistent

176
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,180
um a socket connection to control it so
what is a beacon but look like

177
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,800
haha so we have another pictogram here
we are

178
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,810
we %uh the controller on this site and
then we have our victim box

179
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,950
as soon as we establish our beacon on
the victim box

180
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,560
the beach in will wake up and then he
will actually stand a packet

181
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
to the controller your son the packets
the controller to register himself

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,140
saying I am live

183
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,470
I'm active on this infected machine the
controller acknowledges that

184
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,540
beaten request and then the beach in
goes to sleep

185
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,019
it severs that socket connection so are
whenever

186
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,769
up specified period of time elapses the
victim but then wakes up and contact the

187
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:25,470
controller

188
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,000
d have commenced for me to execute the
controller says no so what happens the

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,120
beach and goes back to sleep

190
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,490
then that beacon wakes up to have to
mess with execute he says no okay he

191
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,910
goes back to sleep again

192
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,160
he wakes up one more time do you have
commencement execute you say yes

193
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,620
okay no problem so what exactly do you
want me to execute to now we're checking

194
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:43,890
in

195
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,730
were downloading the command list in
this case the controller says establish

196
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,410
a cell back to me

197
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,300
in this instance the pecan woke up he
took the committee says you wanna sell

198
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,860
okay

199
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,899
I would give your cell and established
his back to the computer system

200
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,850
so um we are going to actually do some
interactive demos

201
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,950
so let's let's go have a look at the
Beacon but real quick

202
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,410
and so we can see what we're actually
talking about

203
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,890
okay so here we are are missus plan
services are but controller

204
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,320
on that we created it's available on get
carbon also um

205
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,810
on Twitter usually tweet about some the
access or how to get it

206
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,510
so on if you want to establish a
controller the first thing you do

207
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,790
you establish a server socket which
allows you to receive new connections on

208
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,100
to the controller itself

209
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,390
and then also an FTP site this allows
its which seems files and things like

210
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:31,910
that

211
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,620
so pretty much after that everything
else is supposed to be a simple

212
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,810
as possible and also you things as we
progress I'm throughout this

213
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,860
demonstration

214
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,769
okay so let's establish a beacon Satan
on see what it looks like

215
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,079
let me you

216
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,579
this a bit yeah this is it okay that's
going

217
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,339
hot

218
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,190
okay so if I do once established the
beach in the promise for the Beacon

219
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,149
I'm the first to say splinter I'm not
yet seen and if you do dash

220
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,480
eights I have a help option that I show
you all of the

221
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,949
options that you can use for this actual
implant so here we are going to use the

222
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,540
Beacon option so if we answer in Spencer

223
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,139
Daz be for the Beacon and then the IP
address to the controller

224
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,649
the IP address the controllers in this
case is one and it's 162 23

225
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,079
not one yes is right here and then the
port that we're listening for service

226
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,490
socket connections as a cross-court
eighty eighty

227
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,959
which is right here established for
sites to a space

228
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,069
8080 and then as going to the next prime
there will be my beacon interval

229
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,459
how often do I want the beat Kansas leap
before checking in

230
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,259
with mister controller and to see a are
there commence first exit you

231
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:45,649
i wills tell it six seconds i'm for now
that our press

232
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,130
answer okay that's my firewall that's on
the school hadn't

233
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,870
turn that guy of the kinda messed up my
demonstrations

234
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,990
don't do that okay I so it's like i RB
ken is connecting

235
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,850
over to a cell at this spot if we click
on the arm

236
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,639
I beginning agent command I'm terminal
best habitat actually see whenever

237
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,589
a beacon sex in it sex at the beach in
I'm second I just been received

238
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,410
and that's the beacons ID and at this
point at this but we don't have any

239
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,630
commands loaded foreign to execute so if
you do one its to execute commands

240
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,690
upon the next check in let me do this

241
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,149
okay to come over here to the right and
then say at command so

242
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,480
to commands let's do Who Am I

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,380
type right who am i

244
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,860
okay and then also as to the VM ICE

245
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,430
OS gets caption a kiss Aiden Ashley

246
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,069
cue up multiple commands whenever an
implant actually texan and then

247
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:47,680
to enable that you just click Enable to
the right it turned green and the sign

248
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,889
so the next time did so the next time
the agent sex and he dollars the

249
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,149
commands list and then provided the
response

250
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,160
so here I see that time work I'm
executing on Windows 7 Professional

251
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,110
machine

252
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,480
and also call my I'm list right now as
an admin PC

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,279
okay it now let's go back to the
connection status

254
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,260
and if you click on the active tab PC
that we have no active connections

255
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,839
and to the controller so the main
purpose other beating right was to say

256
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,810
okay when is it time to establish

257
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,139
I a s sell to us so I just disable

258
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,829
I'll be can commence the next time to
beat insects and he just said look it's

259
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:20,350
akin

260
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,050
0 comments established a key so if you
click on shortcut

261
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,569
I'm gonna say establish a cell and upon
the next time that the Beacon sex n

262
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,360
men from the second ago so he just
checked in I'm so the next few seconds

263
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,980
we should now see the Beacon is going to
return to sell to us

264
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,510
okay and so that's the cell that the
beach and just responded to us

265
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,149
and actually to have been sent

266
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,240
are okay so I actually built in

267
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,920
are a resolution which I can do I'm the
location for the implant that sex in

268
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,100
was just thinking it's sometimes nice
whenever you have many socket you don't

269
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,639
know is computers are so I actually
display a map to show you will this is

270
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,069
the

271
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:03,069
greatest or latest resolution aware that
infected machine actually is

272
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:05,819
so if you want to see that you click on
the Beacon or you click on the

273
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:06,809
connection here

274
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:11,470
and then you move over to google map and
then Google Maps actually display on

275
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,889
your

276
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,130
I'm using your default browser where I
believe that connection is coming from

277
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,189
at I'm connected since I I wish that one
would work might work in the next one

278
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:22,300
but I listen it will discontinue
continues at least

279
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,459
that was an example just a very quick
example using the beach in but it's

280
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,420
communicate with our controller check
and receive commands and then go to

281
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,040
sleep again

282
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,350
okay so penetration payload migration

283
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,170
whenever you build your botnet so
whenever you build a tool that has

284
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,370
command control and sockets established

285
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,149
I think one thing that is very important
is to make your tool extensible

286
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,410
or liking it so this two months ago

287
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,670
or so we released an update sponsor put
it on get hub

288
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,740
what if at that spot we had a beacon
that was established

289
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,899
unaffected machine buts no kidding two
days ago or whenever we flew over from

290
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,230
the United States over here I created a
new alarm payload

291
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,899
and I put into the system so how do I
know I'll get that updates

292
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,500
to affect the beginning agents that that
I've had running for the last two months

293
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,220
well like I see the new update I just
created today no he won't

294
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,049
so in order to have this feature
election update feature

295
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,429
or an extensible feature I created the
payload migration

296
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,620
a payload migration allows you to take
any binary or

297
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,730
pretty much any file migrated over to
the infected machine from the same

298
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,610
socket

299
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,929
executed and now I can continue
additional exploitation onto the

300
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,140
infected machine

301
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,410
so let's say uncivil Safi um I have an
initial connection to that effect

302
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,329
machine

303
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:44,679
and I want to run clear logs or Alex run
any other exploit sometimes whenever you

304
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,360
magically find a cell phone and fax
machine and then you say okay but I want

305
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,010
armitage

306
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,660
on and take Missy not sponsor well I
like to transfer over

307
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,799
pretty much any paleo that you have now
to that same infected machine

308
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,670
I'm using what we have so here's a
diagram up on what we're starting with

309
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,790
so we're gonna start at the controller
we already have an established

310
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,819
connection

311
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:07,760
so the infected machine and now we have
Metasploit we may also want misplaced

312
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,649
have access on fax machine still

313
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,939
so what happens many times I have
Metasploit I say okay

314
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:17,429
Hail Mary or do whatever you can to give
me access to computer machine sometimes

315
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,120
it works

316
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,029
sometimes it fails but let's say
whatever droppers was successful

317
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,149
to give you access a computer machine
let us now find a way to get Metasploit

318
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,199
months than fact missing also so this is
what it looks like

319
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,279
what we will do from Metasploit we'll
create amid reversed matar paneer

320
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,910
and then we will transmit that reverse
matar paneer from the control socket

321
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,410
on same sex machine then we'll executed
uninfected machine

322
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,040
and now will bring a socket over
armitage or overt Metasploit

323
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,559
if that makes sense hope it does if not
don't worry

324
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,990
we have another demonstration okay

325
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,470
okay let's let's do this let's do this

326
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,980
okay so here's armitage we have it
running and then we have our listener

327
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,170
established I right here listener this
is the IP address up the

328
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,360
Linux machine and the support that were
I'm listening on

329
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,610
on because of time I've recreated the
matar paneer I

330
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,140
reverse TCP but if you have any
questions on that I have a house to

331
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,429
I'm from the gephardt link on that will
show at the end so if you wanna see how

332
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,850
did I create that mean it's

333
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,149
is pretty cool or does Google matar
paneer reverse TCP in everybody and

334
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,079
their brother

335
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,380
much to write about how to use
Metasploit okay so let's go ahead and

336
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,510
I migrate the Paleo I'm what we want to
do now

337
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,770
let's use armed I feature from the

338
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,970
implant so this is going to be are
infected machine I'm Fort sitting

339
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,620
let's go in clear that also as well make
sure it worked earlier

340
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,630
let's make this large okay so

341
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,200
if I answer and splinter a kid s I now
Columbus establishing an implant

342
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,929
connection

343
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,690
out my controller and then the IP
addresses 192 168 up to 23

344
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,690
in this case one port is 8080

345
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,110
and then I have um this is optional and
optional feel that the ends this says OK

346
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,200
in case the current socket has dropped

347
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,970
house and you want me to wait before and
pecan to establish a connection

348
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,409
matter the control if you put t5 that
says connect immediately

349
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,169
so I just wanna make sure that I have a
persistent connection okay so looks like

350
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,190
that was successful and now I have two
machines

351
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,340
our windows is it appears to be Windows
Vista this cuz

352
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,940
I did go back and fix that resolution
but we have windows 7 which is the host

353
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,730
and then what appears to be Windows
Vista but it's really a a Windows seven

354
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,880
I'm machine that we've just infected so
this guy

355
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,490
now I the main purpose here was to
migrate payload so the click

356
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,790
right here on my great pay loan we can
now specify any payload that we want to

357
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,389
transfer over to infect machines

358
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:44,350
executed and then bring that sell over
to a different store which we're now

359
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,799
going to connect armitage

360
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,280
so at the spot there's no connection to
I'm it is a must

361
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,820
so this works okay solace in this guy
over there here

362
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,120
so I specify the people that I want to
transfer over

363
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,270
and the one that will be transferring is
this guy just reverse the CP

364
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,290
over to armitage from our sponsor
connection of the open

365
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,309
and then I also allow it to pre-planned

366
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,889
and then arm append any additional
parameters of a separate saw

367
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:16,010
has on prime others to execute you know
something he still had like 10 primaries

368
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,190
I do that option

369
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,020
at the spot and I think if you hover
your mouse to put a tooltip in that says

370
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,190
looking at yeah so it kinda does your
hands soiled and if you're not sure just

371
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,980
leave a blank

372
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,470
and see what happens pickin I clicked
sec options just to see where I'm going

373
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,340
to put it

374
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,879
I'm going to put it on the infected
machines temporary file temp folder

375
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:37,120
and then I at the bottom here you have
an option do you want me to execute

376
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,820
the payload immediately upon
transmission syntex machine

377
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,889
or do you just want to stay there and I
can execute at another time sorry to say

378
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:44,659
yes and no

379
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,679
and so will hit launched and if this
launch is successful

380
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,800
don't be so fast okay let's see if we
can get the connections armitage

381
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,340
so works OK okay good so um what you
just saw

382
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,360
was a separate armitage connection or is
just

383
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,340
any other program that I can now text
chains from my current botnet to allow

384
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,629
other people to have access and fax
machine as well so that's just a popular

385
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:09,879
migration feature

386
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,139
and I don't have to be omitted it can be
any execute a bill or any file

387
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,889
and then fax machine I just thought you
know whenever we establish a botnet

388
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:22,550
and go to allow additional tools I'm to
migrate from the infected machine

389
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,629
okay what's next of social engineering

390
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:29,040
okay this is this is this the favorite
as a favor mine

391
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,389
so if we can recall from yesterday
mister when spoke about the for that a

392
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:34,770
word that's the worst

393
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,470
on in secure into the computer network
right that was supposed to be the user

394
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,690
ibogaine also spoke about was that the
corona on the Sun flares solar

395
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,340
solar flares okay saw this we have two
really good things the users are bad and

396
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,320
solar flares

397
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,760
are just bad kind that everybody okay so
I what we're going to talk about now

398
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,220
is a DNS host file poisoning and the
credential harvesting and spoke USC

399
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,059
I don't think I have time for that but
if we have time at the end just

400
00:20:59,059 --> 00:20:59,590
reminding

401
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,629
in we can show I this moving up the User
Account Control also

402
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,210
on when those missing so DNS cache
poisoning

403
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,200
the main purpose %uh establishing a DNS
cache poisoning

404
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,510
as let us say mister controller over
here he is the legitimate DNS server

405
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,110
okay or he's a legitimate website and
that's now say you sir are now the

406
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,179
attackers malicious website

407
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,580
I am now the attacker and the man in the
middle you now want to go to the

408
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,340
legitimate website let's say you are

409
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,530
Amazon or bankamerica dot com okay so
you want to log into your bank to check

410
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,460
your account

411
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm now I can poison that DNS and sry I
can say no

412
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,419
don't go to him go to him who is a clone
abyss actual website

413
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,480
so you not knowing the difference cuz
they look exactly like you got the

414
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,750
militias website you can turn your
credentials i nasty you could still your

415
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,530
credentials

416
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,700
and I 42 over to the real arm website so
you don't really know the difference

417
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,590
that hey I just had the credentials

418
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,450
okay that's pretty much one of the main
reasons that we do DNS cache poisoning

419
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,730
so back in 2007 2008

420
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,129
we saw that WoW some really bad on DNS
cache poisoning was going on

421
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:07,200
and know what we do we actually patched
it so if I didn't want to poison

422
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,950
a lot of dr. main top-level domains I
believe that was the one that the

423
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,450
I'm attack worked in 2007-2008 and I see
that have to be very noisy

424
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,110
because I'd have to constantly poison
almost every single DNS

425
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,369
top-level domain and also the
authoritative domain servers

426
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,909
across the entire world and say no don't
go to make america here is actually here

427
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,309
again that's very noisy and has been
patched some at least most that's been

428
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,270
passed by now

429
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,179
so we're not going to do that cuz noise
and it just won't work well the next

430
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:36,830
thing we can do is a man in the middle
which I kinda explained

431
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,210
if I'm inside the network and said have
you going to make america dot com

432
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,350
I am now cast poison both view I say
okay you are now the router

433
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,500
you are now the legitimate website I am
the attacker you do not cause the

434
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,570
radical to me

435
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,809
any packet that you send I'm going to
force the router I'm not gonna tell

436
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,980
router do not said anything to him said
it's me

437
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,659
so now back and forth I can continue to
teach control every website that you go

438
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,240
to

439
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,730
this again is very noisy because I have
to continuously sent

440
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,659
gratuitous are packets in order to can t
that man in the middle attack and is

441
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,159
also very detectable

442
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,190
if you're monitoring the packets on your
network so not going to do that either

443
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,379
we're not gonna do that either

444
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:15,250
instead those actually manipulate just
one and three

445
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,929
at one entry to the infected machine and
then on by adding an instance in a

446
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,889
statement saying we're going to target
the Windows host file

447
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,500
actually say okay instead of going to
your main on domain server and then

448
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,159
handling all of our DNS

449
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,210
on request only go to one file if you
see an entry in the file what's that

450
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,480
on goes that location directly so if
that works a lot of people say

451
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,809
you wait a minute what is the host DNS
file okay good i'm glad you asked

452
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:43,659
so the host DNS pile on this location
with a host in this file

453
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,889
actually exist is pretty much an
important file that can be used

454
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:51,040
up to handle registries in locations
very quickly months because next like

455
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,020
running out of time

456
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,889
so on this is how it works let's say you
want to go to facebook.com

457
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:58,990
my computer system a similar thing is
going to work well I

458
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,899
will check its host of course the van
entry exists as an entry exists I'm

459
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,909
going to Paul

460
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,520
that IP address and then going to send
it back to my brows and say okay

461
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,379
you wanna go to facebook.com his
location on Facebook that you're looking

462
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:10,919
for

463
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,850
so go there instead this now means that
we've just on exploitation vector

464
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,669
if I can poison that hosts file I can
now directly to anywhere you want to go

465
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:21,600
base of the initial website

466
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,860
unless you're trying to go to so I'll I

467
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,070
and now for the attack more pictograms
yes

468
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,639
okay so here we are we are the
controller we have access to the

469
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,750
infected machine

470
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,149
all we're going to do is send one entry
to the in fax machine saying this

471
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:37,149
location

472
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:40,750
as the IP address on any site that the
user might have wanted to go to

473
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,760
then we're going to use the social
engineering toolkit very beautiful

474
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,320
I cannot say it's a warm fuzzy the
social engineering toolkit works very

475
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,100
well

476
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,850
wanted one other things that we're going
to use it for in this demonstration

477
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,230
as actually call on a Web site and then
if I can

478
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,330
steal the user's credentials I'm going
to afford it back to the attacker

479
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,580
and then I will redirect the user backs
the lid legitimate website that they

480
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,480
want to go to

481
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,600
okay so let's see so them a time let's
see if this is going to work well

482
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,629
hopefully this works well soco like the
hardest morning

483
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:16,149
I am so let's go back into sponsor

484
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:20,119
yes so this is the machine that we have
so if you first of what to look at

485
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,440
the registry file for the host in this
file click on your shortcuts go down

486
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,480
still grab

487
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,080
host file correct grab when those hosts
file okay so

488
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,559
you successful grab a file to say this
is where I say the location

489
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,710
I gave you a shortcut right here if you
click on open file hi

490
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,179
this is the and fax machine that we had
and then this is the host father we just

491
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,619
I'm grant from the system

492
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:45,840
so it's just a flat file no text file if
I look at it these are the current

493
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,059
entries on them picked machines host
file so there's nothing in there

494
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,550
that means if I want to go to pace with
dot com there's no entry in the host

495
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:52,869
file

496
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:57,179
hour then contact my local DNS server
that handles all the DNS requests

497
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,119
okay so let's go ahead and put in entry
answer that hosts file

498
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,179
so if you want to do that taken ashore
cousin is a a pencil when does

499
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:08,780
compost pile so what I'm using the
social engineering toolkit

500
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,149
on the Linux machine is to mimic a
website that we've all seen

501
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,909
many many many times and this it's this
website has comparison

502
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,059
okay so the IP address and I'll
mimicking on this site is going to be

503
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,110
192 168 8 20 3.1 forty-three

504
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,840
so I go to this website right now on my
computer you might even be able to do it

505
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,059
if anyone is trying

506
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:32,919
because I I'm connected to the incident
looks like arm so you might actually be

507
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,460
able to see the sights who

508
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,840
so on the Plano right before I got on
the plane I want to act in Paris website

509
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,149
I saw all

510
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,340
look there's a user login and a password

511
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,770
let's clone this site and see if we can
use this for so soon and talking

512
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,330
okay so what we're going to do now we're
going to tell that infect machine

513
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,629
the halls com the entry for the meantime
though that happen Paris

514
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:58,540
as actually located at this address and
if this works the usual go there and for

515
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,110
the credentials and I can check

516
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,470
on the social engineering toolkit
harvested the credentials the lessee if

517
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,740
that's going to work

518
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,470
hopefully this works okay so I'm the
first what we did we clicked on a pens

519
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,700
to Windows host file

520
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,379
on this I'm and then we answer in the IP
address that we want to

521
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:17,429
arm clone so right now it's house at 192
168

522
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,110
22 3.1 forty-three right I believe and
then

523
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,290
the URL the URL that we're actually
trying to redirect the user to

524
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,619
in WWW dot hack and Paris

525
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:35,139
dot com Obama talking too fast if I am
just raise a hand in all slow down

526
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:38,399
you that there's a lot to do and I wanna
snuggle okay so I

527
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,780
just a note saying the spear on with
administrator privileges

528
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,869
okay so right now the implant actually
echoed back saying

529
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:49,270
he disappeared as the host file and we
did not report any errors

530
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,700
on the host file now we just sit back
and went and let us assume that this is

531
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,909
the user now

532
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:58,050
on their machine so you have this up we
have the

533
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,570
I'm out but this intentional I haven't
implant that is not so

534
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,500
I'm any up went on inside a decide if I
want to go to

535
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,429
coming over to be dots hack in Paris dot
com

536
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:14,440
okay I had answer and hopefully

537
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,859
and does not look like on anything

538
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,950
ahold yet the user right now cannot tell
that's on you know

539
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,409
anything is wrong this is like the
correct website I'm trying to go

540
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:28,980
I'll let me just do this a case of
latency the

541
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,800
the otherness a kiss on now and it's
like okay well let me go ahead and log

542
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,149
in to happen Paris

543
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,669
the comment so assuming I have a
username let me just say user

544
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:43,260
1 and then a password was password safe
passage a quick

545
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,470
for a I love that one fluffy bunny

546
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,010
right bunny fluffy bunnies

547
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,629
okay okay so that's the answer doing
remember passwords why not

548
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,620
okay and

549
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,640
said sup so I think my internet was
working right this now would have been

550
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,210
the redirect from the

551
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,610
credential harvester redirect you back
to the legitimate website to try and

552
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,460
login so the user my to the HOA

553
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,760
well have this redirect if they even pay
attention if not you to santa hat

554
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,529
compares to come you try and login again

555
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:17,220
too much to say oh well looks like the
login failed well let us now go to

556
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,610
our credential harvester which is

557
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,149
I running let me go to the location

558
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:27,960
any file that we do receive from the
harvester will be saved and

559
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,130
far this week which

560
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,850
var BBW I'm directory

561
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,960
and then we should have a file I'll as I
could not save

562
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,769
I should I run the skin if this didn't
work if that works he would have seen

563
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:47,399
that they're the text ball save at this
location if you open the text file

564
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,070
you have seen that the users name and
their pastor would've been saved into

565
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,740
that file

566
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,760
looks like that live demonstration got
me there I'm not sure why I could try on

567
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,380
this one but

568
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,539
as a que will continue just right on
your own site everything else works

569
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:00,980
though we poison the DNS

570
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,250
whenever the user wants a cause that
legitimate website redirected them over

571
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,480
to the credential harvester

572
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,289
it the files have been there I i I'm not
sure why it's not there it worked

573
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,330
in the back trust him ok just did

574
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,830
just trust just just just mistrust okay
so um

575
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,730
besides that one less do I just one more
sore scorched-earth

576
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,830
source earth is kind of a term that she
is okay

577
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,639
I cannot gain access to a system or I
cannot have something I want

578
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,760
nobody will be able to access this
computer system right score system

579
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,769
burning everything

580
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:35,240
okay so how are we going to use scores
earth and the side

581
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,470
we're going to use it for denial of
service on the um

582
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,730
enterprise network so if I were to ask
you

583
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,100
what is the mileage service mean was
that was the dots if I was there was a

584
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,919
bus was in denial service noticing

585
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,350
was dial service yes

586
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,580
okay es Salaam

587
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,320
with us with a slight so if we read this
says Fensom

588
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,899
well I'd normally we're gonna sent
misinformation that the server can

589
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,450
handle

590
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,570
and many times the cause the server to
Kress right that's that's what we

591
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,230
understand

592
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,020
at the Palace service to be accepts as
the attacker as the programmer

593
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,539
I feel that definition is insufficient
to say exactly what

594
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,809
a DOS means because in my opinion the
definition of sentence misinformation

595
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:20,899
order to let the server crashed as more

596
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:24,669
and affected is more um I guess the
measure of effectiveness

597
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:28,740
if the boss is working so can access the
server know it has crashed the DOS is

598
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,220
working

599
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,500
instead let us refer to the book of
Solomon me

600
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,970
I am for a new definition for DOS
instead of picking up a DOS as senate

601
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,320
much information let's only consider it
to be

602
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,440
resource starvation if I can start the
available resources on a server or an

603
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
enterprise or system

604
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,720
then I can actually have a measured
effects such that access to the system

605
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,169
at a minimum is degraded and at a
maximum is disrupted

606
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:56,820
okay I think that's better so now I can
ask another question

607
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,870
as the attacker as we're developing his
exploits how do I start resources on a

608
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,450
server

609
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,520
well they're actually many techniques
many techniques exist

610
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,330
%uh and 1i developed two weeks ago
another 1i developed on the airplane

611
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,100
I was like a nine hour flight or so from
washington he was like wow let's see if

612
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,240
this works kinda hard dick

613
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,130
I can you know sometimes when you just
in the zone program you're kinda angry

614
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,860
at the world

615
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,270
but some we have a pink four things that
I learned from that process

616
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,669
and the first if we want to do a das the
first is to

617
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:32,169
analyze legitimate traffic so I want to
toss a website let me go to the website

618
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:34,340
and look at it with the packet analyzer

619
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,139
I E Wireshark to see what does it look
like if I wanted of the system

620
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:41,570
okay the next thing is to learn the
protocol and the structure

621
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,200
this is very important because a DOS on
a Web site

622
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,389
in a city website is going to be
completely different than the way you

623
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:50,090
try and awesome FTP server

624
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,679
and I learned this the hard way was like
okay to I just program the website dost

625
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,269
let's go ahead and do the same process

626
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:58,889
for an FTP server and those like punch
slap in the face I'm sorry

627
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:02,510
I miss refers to this RFC 959 to
understand how to first

628
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,429
authenticate with that FTP server and
then to send the command to start its

629
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:07,470
available resources

630
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,720
and in causa das okay so I think are
good

631
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,270
good that such that's our clue for da so
let's do this real quick let's do this

632
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,330
okay so I am also hosting

633
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,539
arm are hacking Paris website on a
separate IP address

634
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:24,129
this is at one 90 to 160 220 9.9

635
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,370
and everything is identical to the main
website that were familiar with the only

636
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:27,809
thing I

637
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:32,600
added was this I'm script at the top so
that if I refresh the page then you can

638
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,039
see that

639
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,460
you know the script is updating
appropriately that means whenever I went

640
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,909
over to the website and said to have you
index page

641
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:41,909
it's certainly the index page along with
the script my brows excuse a script

642
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:44,919
an agency that okay I just received
information from the server

643
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:48,950
okay let us now have a visual of what
that dos looks like

644
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,559
on the actual network how we had a bit
rate before

645
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,240
it for a place in no no okay only one

646
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,649
Wow either AP is incredible it's
incredible

647
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:03,760
so on what do I do with either a Peter
Aitken allow me to see various notes my

648
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,779
computer network

649
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:08,960
and also it how does a visual with some
with Evernote receives traffic

650
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,030
I can kinda see it expanding go big or
small base of love

651
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,069
its bandwidth utilization inside the
network so right now

652
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:18,859
F I worked soo move this over and this
is working okay

653
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:23,359
yet so you actually see that on this in
my system that sent the request over

654
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,369
and then this is the our server not this
my system and this is the server

655
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,889
he sent to the missile request over to
the server the server some low traffic

656
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:33,980
back to the I'm system and then it goes
away because right now we're not

657
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,679
exchanging information

658
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,030
so let us use in Swiss and if we are
going to execute a DOS

659
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,129
on that network when we expect this
suddenly appear on if you're excited to

660
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,490
allow traffic is being sent

661
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:49,119
at at once we've will pretty much expect
this to go completely red because red

662
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,500
as the protocol for HTTP okay so let
some visual what what what is that does

663
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,290
look like

664
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,400
let's see let's see okay so if you want
to execute a website das please again

665
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,300
use this for good enough for evil

666
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,599
house and we're going to use less I'd
ask for good I don't know but you'd

667
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,940
figured out ok okay so

668
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,050
if I come over here and to the shortcut
de dos website

669
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,960
okay then I answer in the IP address
other website you can also use abiam's

670
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,109
the Urals

671
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,030
I think I mean the program the for IP
address and what's best that way and

672
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,390
then

673
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,520
I went 62-20 that 139 right

674
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,910
and you can leave the port of its 18 mom
but others and million

675
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,040
so once I hit answer

676
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,260
%ah other issues one artist that one
implants

677
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,770
executed the holidays guy suffer hip
okay I'll get there goes

678
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,540
okay so what you're seeing is this an
are the west lies that

679
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,520
also what's missing is this implant I
just sent so much information so that

680
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,430
web service thing tonight the index page

681
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,010
give me a in that state's not only that
I instantiate about 10,000 threads

682
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,910
each person saying give me your index
page right now so if that is

683
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,650
arms its that a successful the website
might actually have too much information

684
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,520
that I can handle

685
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,780
and is going to crash okay so let's see
if the crest

686
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,089
a crest I'm so if I were to refresh its
all before

687
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:10,650
that refreshing the is gone so you saw
before that refresh the webpage so the

688
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,990
JavaScript that we wanted to or I can
see the time now I'm tossing that site

689
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,800
it's down that that's ever actually
crashed until will go back and restart

690
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,400
the server but even if we did we start
the server

691
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,750
you see that up how much time do I have
to help

692
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,960
23 minutes okay good okay so

693
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,270
but let's try this let's try this let's
see if we can make this look

694
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:37,060
right if up okay it does not appear

695
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,580
as as I wanted to but let's just say
right now you see that a just the kinda

696
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,240
sleeping

697
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,680
waiting for that server to come back
online so if I go back

698
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,900
armed services the are missing a host
the server also what I use for the demo

699
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,730
I use at this web server I'm to host
that website wanna go in

700
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:00,730
call the doctor that he's finished is
done for okay so if I just restart its

701
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,240
okay if I restart the server and then go
back to yep thought you see the implant

702
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,260
recommend %ah servers up till it

703
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,710
so gonna try television and

704
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,450
and now the server we try to bring it up
but some it happened so fast if I try

705
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,589
and reload the server is

706
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,290
is done for organ still down so they
just wait and wait and wait until he say

707
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:19,900
okay

708
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,380
couldn't stop the Bogside I think
they've suffered enough so if I want to

709
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,099
stop

710
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,859
the DOS army to go over here it's a halt
website boss

711
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:31,200
okay then your so I'm now the agency's
on the implants top

712
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,619
they will stop the bus okay so at least
I give you a halt Peter

713
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,470
the next on it FTP that when I whole
okay

714
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,530
at the you can tell I I like that one
i'd did on the plane

715
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,599
okay so if I want to go to our FTP
website I'm also hosting the FTP website

716
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,140
on 192 168

717
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,490
223 that 139 a kiss of I can lend

718
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,630
I'm not the part that you can see that I
have sought to establish from

719
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,170
about once a 139 that's on connecting to
and let miss

720
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:02,020
login anonymous nice but i right

721
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,770
I didn't cry akin you try that again

722
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:11,530
anonymous okay up to get logged in so
f'in sir

723
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,960
binary mode you don't have to do that
but

724
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,010
while okay are so high you can so that I
can interact with the FTP server

725
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,040
appropriately right the power to close
the socket

726
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,440
um call the connection in this log in
again I can still

727
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,010
login let me is the dacite so get some
logged in as anonymous so everything is

728
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,750
working appropriately

729
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,569
until we Dawson okay so on the so we
added we added the FTP

730
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:41,890
dos lemiux makers larger because they're
additional

731
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,510
I'm promise to answer in some things you
can just leave default

732
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,690
so right here the first thing will
answer is the IP address the web server

733
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,089
that we're going to dos

734
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,220
which is that right there and then the
next is the

735
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,890
defaults on port number for the
controller and then did

736
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,410
default port number for the control and
the default port number for data

737
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:00,990
investors

738
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,230
you know you know might have to pee
protocols on port 21 import 20

739
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:08,150
okay and then the user named I want to
use to try and login

740
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,359
I we will use anonymous for now I'm
going to add more to the speeches just

741
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,400
new that I think this is the most likely
at in and then just a blank password

742
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,750
makes you read the quotes intact

743
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,880
so we know on what the parts for the
password and then

744
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,740
I haven't added more to this gets but
eventually you'll be able to daisy-chain

745
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,690
additional commands that you want that
FTP server to execute

746
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,270
whenever you're we're trying to log in
and of that system but for right now it

747
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,560
works for one command

748
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,000
eats and I would just say list so this
means if this is working

749
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,339
login authenticate with the server and
then list whatever we have

750
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:44,690
but something I did what this does is
that it gets angry okay good

751
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,330
sup size agency are das it starts to
grow bigger and bigger and bigger and

752
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,599
bigger and bigger

753
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,130
so that on eventually what's happening
I'm spawning as many connections as

754
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,980
possible

755
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,359
after I try and spawn are many
connections I been tryin spahn as many

756
00:39:58,359 --> 00:39:59,060
more so

757
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,790
this will go to about 20,000 connections
arm as possible

758
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,080
at the Cannes until eventually on the
FTP server

759
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,400
Wilcrest now on at the spot over here

760
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,490
I put a status this is currently how
many open sockets I have to the FTP

761
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,280
server

762
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,900
okay so you see is this going to
continue to grow and grow and grow and

763
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,130
then every 100

764
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,210
I did your status on this site their
dis- okay so right now we have two

765
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:21,530
hundred

766
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,900
open apps office and it's going to
continue to grow so

767
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,099
ice I'm going really fast I want to show
this let's see

768
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,660
I if I were to show the FTP FileZilla

769
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,750
is low his prime I'm going to um so
forth because it's

770
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,430
it actually freezes in fact the whole
computers reason for this reason too

771
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,770
much information

772
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,180
I open open open opened quickly

773
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,339
400 a kiss right now about 400 sockets
okay

774
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:51,369
so finally you can barely see is what I
cannot interact with this

775
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:55,020
I'm yes sauce is not responding because
our boss is being effective

776
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,810
0 finally look what happened ok I was
waiting for this

777
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,270
okay so let me come back to this side
real quick I like to give you status to

778
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,819
know whenever our dos actually detect
something

779
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:09,390
so we told you that the agents are
sniffing the network to see okay

780
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,670
any time that we have a website das EFX
my agents detect

781
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,099
that the website doesn't affect it
reports back to saying okay I think our

782
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,700
Das is good go and check it out

783
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,830
and hopefully the website is no longer
active das complete

784
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,040
and this case we have the FTP orbiter SR
da spot saying okay

785
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,730
we actually just received a status call
for twenty-one

786
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,950
and if we refer to the RFC 959 status
court

787
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,460
421 means on the connection has been
refused

788
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,490
and not only that the box report what
the server actually says

789
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,560
the server said survey says

790
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,970
that's too many users are logged in for
this account to try again later

791
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,859
in I don't like the looks on that so let
me go back

792
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:54,170
to a just on okay

793
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,280
if I were to try and do an FTP
connection again 192 168

794
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,910
one all that 223 not 139

795
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,400
FTP yeah so I want to login as anonymous

796
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,940
ok yes answer password and refuse my
connection

797
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,390
because it is saying that too many users
are logged in for this account

798
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,880
so you know we're gonna try again later
so was both of effective yessum

799
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,950
yes yes as affected do not let see I'm
so

800
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,280
we wanted look at the network again
they're still having at I'm so they're

801
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,220
trying to bust as much as possible

802
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,589
so eventually let me come over here than
this to be the last one arm

803
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:33,270
often difficult time if you say halts
FTP server

804
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,970
bus okay the agents report back the DAS
were hot in the boss

805
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,369
and now you can see no more traffic is
being sent as much as possible

806
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,690
that FTP server FTP server should be
working OK

807
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,830
so if I were to try one more time to
login

808
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,069
as early as before to the FTP server as
anonymous

809
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,310
password them they were so we can log in
again saw

810
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:58,270
at least thats I'm just a few options
that we added in onto our

811
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,400
are botnet allowed to do as many things
as possible

812
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,099
on this compact here

813
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:09,299
and I want to finish okay so we just
finished demo I we did the DOS

814
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:12,910
lasso additional features these are
additional features I did not talk about

815
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,540
but are built into the arm splint a
botnet I have

816
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,900
and then I also released tutorials on if
you want to do this yourself

817
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,900
how would you be able to do it because
my goal is for you everyone to be able

818
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,440
to

819
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,580
create their own but an exploit the
computer network for good

820
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,540
not for evil okay I'm say your things
that we do not talk about

821
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,980
over a payload clipboard injection USC
spoof if we had more time

822
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,299
I would've I'm so on a few I was really
learn

823
00:43:37,299 --> 00:43:40,910
worse all I'm okay looks like another
time okay I next light

824
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,020
okay if you have any questions you can
um

825
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,420
this a why we can actually grab the
Colts are released the code

826
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,810
and also the implants that we have I
have new updates coming

827
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,480
like the FTP that we saw a just program
that on the airplane sauces I get back

828
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,029
home

829
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:58,420
on Sunday night you'll see the new
version that will be up uploader back to

830
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,549
get help and if you have questions email

831
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:04,710
just a minimal I'm pretty much always on
light will I'm always online six hours

832
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,390
behind

833
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,109
I guess or however many you know in the
US okay and then also um

834
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:12,299
if you have any question you can also
send me an question on

835
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:15,580
I'm get help yes questions

836
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,869
up

837
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,220
its as they want the question is is the
detail in one of the slides showing the

838
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,480
credentialing attack

839
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,140
and you said you had it all spells and
then you simply use that to the wrong

840
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,770
server and then just to redirect

841
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:35,020
actual server but when you do that if
the host file like we use a proxy or

842
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,990
according to the hope it's not okay

843
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,310
so your question was how does the
redirect really work if I just added one

844
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,470
entry to the host file

845
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,000
you but what do you do when you want to
really to the actual website because

846
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,349
you can because it's in the hospital the
was gonna go to the very IP and

847
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:52,170
to change the host but you have to
restart the browser take immigrant

848
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,670
because it catches this

849
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,069
so how do you solve this problem okay so
you're saying if I want to remove the

850
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,130
entry that we s

851
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,670
I'll okay I don't have time but if he
saw

852
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,260
when I did grab hosts file we actually
grab the original host of uninfected

853
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,099
Missy

854
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,109
so the next night you do is poison host
file again

855
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,260
and what you can actually download a
real upload that original host Paula

856
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,660
backs the computer machine

857
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,160
so now the host file goes back to how it
was recently in essence removed but the

858
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,890
brothers catching the information so you
have to restart the brother first

859
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,529
right and that honestly that's okay it's
me if the user has to restart the

860
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:23,950
browser we do it all the time

861
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,260
from so via yes oh that's

862
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,170
thanks to a question you any other
questions

863
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,290
I'll yes home about sun spots or

864
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:40,310
for the Wentworth I'm not that basic
okay

865
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:44,480
I was wondering if you grab a solar
flare out on it to us when early times

866
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,779
all okay yeah so the question was are in
our solar flare

867
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:51,520
added yeah how about numbers in infinity
plus one

868
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,910
okay then you'll see solar flare ok
anything else

869
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,330
anything else alright honestly thank you
so much for your time to question truth
