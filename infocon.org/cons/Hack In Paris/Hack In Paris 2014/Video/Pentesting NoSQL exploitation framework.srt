1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,179
nothin France I'm my name is Francis

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,560
and be speaking on up investing
analytical data bases

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,550
have no secrets but even for him so
about me

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,850
I am independent security researcher a
number of open security

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,369
open securities a is an open
organization for

6
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,730
security in minded people a me pose to
two routes

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,039
a videos exit on a research we do

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,770
so I'm going but pushing me about this
DVD

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,120
at were gonna die. above conferences a

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,879
and asleep a morning and as such as
angles and i'd

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,930
so a

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,879
let's get straight the other end of the
talk the body single

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,719
will be giving more importance on to the
sewer plant in so many even consoles of

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,070
the

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,149
are not people databases we look at band
is something I use

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,760
a you know you not been good unlimited
books issues

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,159
a would openly the no secret but didn't
remark

18
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,200
and we have plenty of the most so

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,670
a in many above on officer vote at the

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,330
not even at abuses so lets the have a
look good

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,650
a a the main features of

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,229
a not without a visa you minus the

23
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,790
they have support the open-source
thereon

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,720
pretty well and posters it's been a bit
for the twenty-first century read

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,799
a it does not use a relational database

26
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,150
and it is mainly known for its feature
acid

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,770
and is Adam City consistency isolation
and durability

28
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,770
okay so what makes it

29
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,159
different from people databases is that
it is sq metres

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
that I can be inserted into the
analytical database

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,869
without do defining your re did that at
least

32
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:56,060
so and the format of the data being
inserted

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,420
can be changed at any time so this makes
it a

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,770
makes no secret that ABC's by different
people it happens

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,149
it so probably get a raise

36
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,840
them the a monument to resolve those
economies is a ok white columns

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,599
families its base and Cassandra
commander them document

38
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,069
still databases a Mongo DB and toasty be

39
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,099
100 Pulu a superstore databases

40
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,360
practice Alexander them and we have got
that

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,140
after to resist near 40 next Exeter so
let's

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,790
let's analyze the a constitutional the
political security

43
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,910
so you see screenshot

44
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,060
you find that a we have plenty of a

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,560
the open bow open AP's available on
short on netbook so

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,230
short on making me if we are going is an
open platform you could search for

47
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,810
IP's I run in the same boat sold you
find that

48
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,550
on mobile has an a really large amount
of

49
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,680
eyepiece open available would come and
give them using the mobile client

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
its via you see that promotes 84,000

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,599
novel called seeds 01704 is

52
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,970
its accost over 35,000 so no

53
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,409
for is aiding the current such as those
approximate to be

54
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,470
about 1 like so you could see that the
amount of

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,379
open a up the AP's available among

56
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,769
so let's have a look at

57
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,890
sum up the issues we could be used
within a single database is

58
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,629
so a about abuse me be a cause

59
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,360
you don't have anybody from the PI the
post use these dual

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,140
for certain certain applications PSP

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,310
a for these a databases produced buddy
and

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,840
its its the data recorder don't so let's
have a look at

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
upbeat and abuses into you someone would
he be

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,110
more voices in NC purse purse a moot
point

65
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,500
indians a family properties of people
databases

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,180
they occur query language we use a
similar the mood

67
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,620
the accuses the customer be some
protocol

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,489
among bonus the a the Ahmadi be

69
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,329
they mean on board Tucson as you don't
own by default

70
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,690
i'd has there been a face on 280 17

71
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,699
on most acclaimed and what is the source
said I

72
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,690
uses the unwieldy by: protocol that is
represented using these on Form

73
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,190
so the globe Architektur

74
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,759
a the symbol a activity up to 20 decline
it's a welcome addition

75
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,070
you have been with over and the local
crimes and

76
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,229
differ among clients constituted so

77
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,630
a whole does the attack again a I don't
as a

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,169
lot of possibilities or your you can
sniff enumerated

79
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:57,470
he could use it does good condition
attacks and denial of service attacks

80
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,080
okay so the dow asked about tax office

81
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,220
maybe for stealing looking for the DoS
attacks possible

82
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,979
so don't doubts about tax

83
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,509
you the mostly used I use against mine
would be a

84
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,840
Manuel uses the dow skip engine I who
will view dose-dependent

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,490
a it was fortunes greater than 2.4 in
about

86
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,930
do is using despite a monkey gas turbine
engine for

87
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,440
oceans less than 2.4 so

88
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,229
10 birdies in Longwood BB has been under
the scanner a

89
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,440
example would be the recent poll and
execution want nobody

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,770
in the more TV which helps the attack
had to be in a

91
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,669
us to make this a longer said functions

92
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,880
abilities and ousted a possible tenses

93
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,449
other tornadoes for clinton's didn't
even go a shed

94
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:53,570
we have a source talking about us and
plenty of all the dose to function a

95
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,300
front nineties that we use can be used
within the among would-be

96
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,110
so let's have a basic look at some of
the was he who commands

97
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,300
the used inman would be so and

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,759
map in secret is the do a double on the
sand skip

99
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,240
ought to a double pipe and equal to you
had a really good

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,080
to get to this a when unusually demo

101
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
seeing da strip a so or wait wait

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,889
seemed awesome is one of the a modern
times

103
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,000
so I and asking you you have

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,819
a certain see the situations where you
need to

105
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,960
Barbie get that so or so what happens is
that you could

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,780
right certain doubts to clinton's the
that you could

107
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,150
youth a you provide a cost function and
you could call it again and again

108
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,810
so and the no secret spy agency Mossad
has also to the

109
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,490
capability to add functions and you
could call them

110
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,550
so Manuel stalls announced departments
within the

111
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,419
ID be done system odious a and

112
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,880
you know you could you would be custom
scripts using the you also a script

113
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,720
command

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,830
so time ticking down strip a

115
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,590
offense to the database mobile so this
is an important key factor

116
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,259
while writing PHP applications for
Milwaukee WI based

117
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,470
apps you find that on this was one of
the

118
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,860
means it's not excused you would use the
a database object indifference

119
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,099
a to what I would do we mean by that

120
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,789
I'm so if a fan attack at the

121
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,810
so the application is one other a

122
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,740
and I got would pretty much a use the
database object at a friends

123
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,900
to get do produce a Texas the database

124
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,500
so this was on emotions on own will

125
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,830
less than two point or less moma's bats
this

126
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,270
for lessons about so so deep dark pretty
much gossip in the standard here

127
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,000
so so still the even though the block

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
the a database reference ordered the
dude

129
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,650
Joseph the conscience when available you
could use timing based attacks

130
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,590
to check for attack josephine's action
possibly develop applications

131
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,410
among the ship's support SB dole most
your house the functions

132
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,590
a so apartment from from the done sleep

133
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,069
a play on the second would attended and
the application delay but I seconds

134
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,110
so this has been this man who has also
been added to the

135
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,380
a Nazi coffee mug

136
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,709
okay so this binder difference August
this is also an important factor

137
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,190
after the longer had blocked the
database a big difference

138
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,459
the this point there was one of the a
mean

139
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,890
used to bypass the bypassed that it is a
dick so what happens is

140
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,000
this a if you are aware that

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,390
this point that uses to return objects
within the conference

142
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,910
so my attacker could use disappointed
2.6

143
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,260
and Adam the a and application

144
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,260
we have a a look at all these examines
32

145
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,490
because that is the application in
confirmable

146
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,860
Sophie up

147
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,420
so if you search for minutes to lead

148
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,730
don't think this is a murder that accuse
me to meet him so I'm so glad we

149
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,420
we keep it it is it back and that is to
use the data

150
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,420
who

151
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:05,670
thing

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,480
so you could see that pretty much a when
we

153
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,140
pull the application to have been this
the begin demanding

154
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,640
all a username and passwords that the

155
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,080
application we had written who

156
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,940
what overall it was used to have what I
was a function called

157
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,100
how that which is used in more would you
be doing value be jealous upon Thames

158
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,130
so what we do did that

159
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,000
a be given a couple a blind a have good
condition

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,470
try and we tried again we do you think
this point

161
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,980
so school

162
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,760
alleged so what happens if even this is
Bob

163
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,230
so a we have the Washington come on by
default

164
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,630
a guided by a bone to all mom without

165
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,860
longer functions so if so unique fan

166
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,740
a me know the application developer
blocks the this pointer

167
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,920
we have the the washington won since
they were sometimes bone gonna be

168
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,560
Department functions so

169
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,560
what happens is that

170
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,550
us unless the a not a good place using
this

171
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,290
this operators block so what you do is
you could use the washroom

172
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,730
and the dumb the and a database for you

173
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,160
so this is what is what some of the
that's good condition you what you think

174
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,459
used to a by bus applications written in

175
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:16,459
a p

176
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,420
so among both bhp PHP

177
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,540
is wanna be dishonored XO so what we
could do is

178
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,439
PHP connotes the I'm reduced into
bracket

179
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:41,319
the brackets to raise so what happens is
that even if you specify

180
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:45,079
brackets after the but I media it's gone
with declining

181
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,920
so who is this his issues with that

182
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,350
if an attack that specifies certain a
carries

183
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,759
within the a within the

184
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,829
but Alyssa in the front a function what
happens is that

185
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,340
and it determines on the a

186
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,640
point decrease that we and grateful

187
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,440
so some of the work does this cause
discuss for

188
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,480
logo base PHP applications were don't
like me

189
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,530
an hour which which means that Nordic
will do so this is similar to

190
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,760
a secret injection but it happens here
in local so

191
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,040
some of the more attack with those are
like Donuts is

192
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,400
door type and/or a so

193
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,530
door lockset X's not just the documents
that have

194
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,370
the specified feed so if the if ur
specify name

195
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,850
aspin a name to use any mixes for the
application

196
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,690
domes or the to all the information
related to it

197
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,210
that door type: so text documents

198
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,300
for feed a is of specified day and 4.0

199
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,720
ignited sorry state spending on mince is
very good

200
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,850
problem

201
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,870
it was exhausting I longer DB

202
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,010
under to do in the a environment is too
easy for tax the maximum size limit for

203
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,250
a the stories cable with people who
stood between GV

204
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,450
a the use command within the motion

205
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,890
a helps you create I would be databases
on the flight

206
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,190
to our an attacker could be use it I do
is that he would like

207
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,330
the what we do that JavaScript functions
do

208
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,440
a create databases define so

209
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,810
what happens is that he you could create
a on creating

210
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,140
other databases undue a the and that

211
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,780
this basic uses up so an MD database
takes up to 192 MB this is that one of

212
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,890
the key factors for the just a sec such
an attack

213
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,540
so let's have a look at the cult

214
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,680
BB the coach you got to capture

215
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,190
its this but symbol could use a database
you have the use on

216
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,500
and declined esculent just if you're
going to face

217
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,960
political the book back and coach TV

218
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,060
know if you can interface which is about
us and the mistreated

219
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,930
so well just yet I could begin

220
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,890
a that was about tax I excesses she is
out of

221
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,650
and sleeping attacks a sum up the

222
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,820
that serves on the key features of coach

223
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,900
it is a dream and I'm a BB

224
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,230
used to be is on documents object it is

225
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,520
enough free accuses the GDP or about

226
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,050
I it as a fusion been a face the plan
uses did a CPA to communicate with the

227
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,630
backend

228
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,960
so what's the

229
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,080
and access for the couch a so Mike

230
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,860
for couch by the four you have the on
mcmartin which means that

231
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,110
anyone could have access to the do any
of the

232
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,580
to the whole database so well

233
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,930
the short on a ball that their us pretty
much laid

234
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,770
thousand buses those so I've been buddy
you could definitely going to the

235
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,580
a that every sentient you could access

236
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,790
he would be stored I don't died was more
than doesn't listen songs

237
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,130
so the other in addition kooky seafood
so if you're in the city you could see

238
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,810
for the world

239
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,250
are hot keys the Christian princess and
no I mean

240
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,459
and entered eternal a across a port tax

241
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,690
are possible and replication of
different industries

242
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,720
are usual a exorcist its name injection

243
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,280
is also possible in the future interface
a and in and out of service attacks

244
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,510
possible on file in racial attacks are
two possible outcomes

245
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,130
so let's have a look at the wannabes

246
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,280
excesses is that the talking to face you
happy steam injection

247
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,790
that can be used the attackers do you
delivered

248
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,970
victim to other sites across a poor

249
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,990
back I S nice like a

250
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,340
you how you could spare it takes for the

251
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,460
suppose you have you could be the the
application

252
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,400
checks for the you on it so what happens
is that a

253
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,650
if a suppose consider back and so over I

254
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,680
as as I was a little busy Fabius so you
would

255
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,940
what he would do is that he was
specified the local host AP

256
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,940
and check for back and open boats so a

257
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,470
this the sport you won't get by scanning
by using in map or something like that

258
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,090
to thats more how the Xbox are you

259
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,190
the plane finally name enumeration

260
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,130
isn't a possibility to petition so

261
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,050
other indication kooky I the main
feature of this is that it expires

262
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,010
within 10 minutes

263
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,350
it's one of the a factor said

264
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,640
to attack this would a 12

265
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,350
do we're gonna like where

266
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,910
a using the authentication cookie so a

267
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,060
so the that would want to use these
demands

268
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,080
between so the no secret expedition
frame-up

269
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,860
texting by automating decision had Jamba
condemn

270
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,630
demand in a city in full sewed what
happens is that if you put

271
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,220
if you sniff and kooky something I don't
I'm actually

272
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,760
eating the cookie and their not into the
session and gets

273
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,840
don't see that happening so

274
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,010
PHP on coach Dale a

275
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,450
uses the call every to send requests to
the FBI

276
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,720
I unrelated PHP app score a certain
laboratory

277
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,900
p the papon execution so

278
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,280
this is only I and II is only one of the
beach because I was a iphone

279
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,570
there are many other most of them use
because agreed to send to Chris

280
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,930
so so

281
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,250
what's the problem with the PHP I'll on

282
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,090
good so the problems that you can see
that

283
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,310
a it uses the since

284
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,770
accuses the rest bb8 a you can see that

285
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,720
it is directly communicating the Supt
Chris

286
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,120
so and unrelated PHP application put
well

287
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,370
force you to you to Vita

288
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,920
to navigate to other pages are to
navigate through either a big part in

289
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,140
the database

290
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,930
here you could see that the the

291
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,760
function 19 Min is Korean test agree and

292
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,300
a test since get triggers need the URL

293
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,730
and a documentary

294
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,400
the Korean just function if you

295
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,950
take within the lsos who would find that
it defaults to the

296
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,460
agree so so what happens is that

297
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,850
the whatever you given a

298
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,130
unlimited calls could result in
execution

299
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:55,130
so let's have a look at this up

300
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,510
it so love this application such as for

301
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,620
and user and Francis their uses there

302
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,260
and get it is found this displays on the
use in a bus or if it is not

303
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,630
this place before the a

304
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,919
error message see will see that pages

305
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,220
have anybody had a message so that you
could see a

306
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,960
you could see that are it it is you're
searching for the

307
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,830
a it is you going to get tickets to the
a database open sec for the

308
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,330
you for any values happy so

309
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,880
so there's an API call available

310
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,460
in faculty be disney on ice and a score
changes

311
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,960
so

312
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,990
a underscore changes or underscore

313
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,990
on docs which means on documents

314
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,480
so what happens is that a these AP
accordance

315
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,630
a such as on the a documents that are
available

316
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,630
so you could pretty much see that the
available a document

317
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,000
this find this year

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,159
israeli do and you could further a

319
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,360
the these a pic botha fallows the attack
but didn't get the database information

320
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,360
and so on the same as for

321
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,250
is an application a his a scene which
runs on the same logic

322
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,750
a what happens he is that you

323
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,600
as soon as you send

324
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,740
and all the knobs which is an ABAP won't
be doing

325
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,850
it automatically locking things to the
wanna move code is that

326
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,899
will see that

327
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:07,049
a the the ground uses to get no

328
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,600
so what happens is that a since the doc

329
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,730
evaluated to true that began in some
doubt us instead

330
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,600
since the on Knox commander don't
something some data in it

331
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,450
so the on so the document contained that
%uh so

332
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:28,450
it returned to so that's why be logged
in

333
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,740
so let's have a look into this a dennis
is no more different

334
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,990
others let's have a look at the
Renaissance protector

335
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,580
a there is that it is willing to move
you have the FBI

336
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,450
and the other is databases on your
declines connected to it

337
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,470
some of the key features of

338
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,559
a it is that there is up it is a
key-value store in Indian

339
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,039
yeah I did give would be to order it is
different from the other

340
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,570
uncle and coach use the UN you best

341
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,140
I'm independence leader too so I'm time

342
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,429
it is driven by a confirmation fight a

343
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,880
the documentation is actually pretty
much funding for it is if you really

344
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,419
don't know

345
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,650
that is good condition its a you have
you find at least five bucks for sure

346
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,990
and it supports find out attacks like

347
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,059
strings ashes sets no-nonsense

348
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,210
so

349
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,059
a so are some of the attacks possibly
get it is a

350
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:44,289
databases up and you could build for it
is possible to which is possible between

351
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:44,870
the

352
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,980
culture and mobile I have denial of
service attacks

353
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,020
you have become and killing a you get
buried

354
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,950
we have the config reunite we have our
belief I really like

355
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,120
and we have blind faith animations which
could be used while

356
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,549
happened to it in person for the for
drive

357
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:04,940
get United a screenshot activities some
of the

358
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,030
is one of the a way said that reduce
government is not to be

359
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,210
supports attackers it is written that

360
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,880
a since it is pretty fast an outside
attack again

361
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,610
play up to 150 people so it's the second
against a good books

362
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,730
so this is pretty much inspiration for
the attack so

363
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,870
a good written blue good a crack

364
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,110
a pretty much long possibly then or 10

365
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,659
something so a

366
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,679
phyllis was in is an important factor
while I when attacking

367
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,280
so a response and supports there is no
skipping support for

368
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,470
I did this was insistent 2.6 a 36
introduced

369
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,860
a Brus victims cooking fortunes greater
than two point lead

370
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,460
so so and the scripting

371
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,309
is really an important factor a the main
problem with phyllis was that

372
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:00,960
so some of the writers

373
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,870
US Britain and in NBC's a issues as you
are demanded scripts

374
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,309
their new engine is probably sandboxed
and it offers

375
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:12,200
pretty much with security a the global
relievers productions

376
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,380
is one of the examines why release spoke
with secure

377
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,480
this group are executed using QR

378
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,340
when the recession so

379
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,840
these are the Linda no I number of
libraries

380
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,460
available a within the unit is you could
easily these

381
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,510
these are the only a lebanese-israeli
offers by skipping so

382
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,580
these when taking by going to the
lebanese it's pretty much

383
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,840
are ligament for the attack but still
you have many options

384
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,850
let's have a look a before you get in
the attacks the band

385
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,260
I'll as I used to valued scripts are
using their

386
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,480
going to be the dingleberries as could
get

387
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,169
this is an exorcism with the conference
to get rid a

388
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:02,030
so on sum up the one of the important
point I'll

389
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,049
in there is is that why the script is
running no other functions can be

390
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:05,500
accessed

391
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,760
accordingly operations cannot be
performed so this is one of the

392
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,929
a una the big blue a

393
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,950
on a big problem of protease so if an
attacker in San

394
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,190
a I do a

395
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,190
so no no user code state database

396
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,200
our issuing commands except for this

397
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,809
Squidbillies Texas which could only be
given by the

398
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:31,510
admitted so this is a

399
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,010
zoo are pretty much one night I denial
of service a

400
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,130
you tell it to printed why Jennifer you

401
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,520
so what happens is that be resources get
exhausted and

402
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:48,640
but you must be adjust our days so

403
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,809
the a rename command

404
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:56,280
AB Corp used so commands can be disabled
by attacking

405
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,889
so what happened here is that a fan
attack a concept a

406
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:03,360
connects to the celebs using the blame
he could

407
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,780
a premium demands a such as he could
bring in the con-

408
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,080
account for command to some article man
he once

409
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,230
or he could even permanently disable the
government by using the

410
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,760
a basically just a renaming to nothing

411
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,790
so the command a becomes completely
useless

412
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,290
so are budget friendly date

413
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,090
this is one of the main problems of a
this

414
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,679
horrendous database a config the config

415
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,960
under espy's get gives the gun
confiscation for today's

416
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,460
the config space set sets the
consolation

417
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,820
a the a before command a

418
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,059
Richelieu have a demo for this a

419
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,059
the frame enumeration this this is
useful if I'd been distant

420
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:53,770
a you have a district environment a now
under

421
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,669
it's pretty much locked out what would
you say is your used to do fine

422
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,139
and it is a which is one of the a

423
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,320
one of the lost creatures to open a
fight

424
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,919
a the finest although the file doesn't
open

425
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,860
gives the file a gives whether the
information that vilified

426
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,280
or that it exists or not so what happens
is that

427
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,940
you had with the you fight 1w that Texas
but could not open fire

428
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,440
so a we we take for the Vees

429
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,460
North that exist so work well an
attacker could use to make

430
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,500
find dates to

431
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,500
have a look at the most

432
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:04,879
ok this is the a defining a blind
fighting in the nation

433
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:08,009
so I have connected to my local both
through

434
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:13,330
I run the a you evaluate the command but
I don't do fight to open the fight

435
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,739
so a since no such file existed

436
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:21,559
I had to do instead the no such file
extra directly

437
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,239
this stand trail face so

438
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:29,309
the exit up also is a lifetime tool

439
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:33,749
a what happens is that since it I do I
do it

440
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,049
a it tight opening a fight which had

441
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,539
I you got this it is totally in a

442
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,259
but what we could see that and error
message the there was no said

443
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,049
there wasn't a there was indeed a
telling that

444
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:52,220
a notified or tactics district so it
pretty much means that the

445
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,869
fight is available for attacker the fire
the United

446
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:03,009
so the config a space gets topless

447
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:06,409
you the a configuration on the there
this box

448
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,519
sorry if you could see that and only

449
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,559
there is fired rights its

450
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:17,809
a it is the database 5 do

451
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,460
what's last name last resort an attacker
could do that he could

452
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,399
do you like be location do

453
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,529
summer people Texas where some

454
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:35,639
where the I P your by the GDP

455
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:42,639
so

456
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:52,970
who to see that

457
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,899
at stratum I which is that and you

458
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:18,200
so

459
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,229
now you see that have in the W and
acting at dust

460
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:29,229
fine through

461
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,230
it's like

462
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:51,230
some data so that

463
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:07,230
so let's I will get deep fried p

464
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,460
would to see that

465
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,000
a the fight has been ordered them and
the

466
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,269
you could use you would I between what I
defense

467
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:21,630
on the data services

468

you in for Disease there's donuts on
wheels a

559
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,760
for college I finally released an update
wasn't very good specify

560
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,890
suppose expedition like face

561
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,100
people specify the database you want to
extract

562
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:15,860
specific to crystal

563
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,630
I'd it goes on in that it's the database
keys open sick

564
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,300
so you have the a condoms have the
database

565
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,790
open sick this is a metaphor

566
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,450
you could eliminate it is anticipating

567
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:38,450
news

568
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,200
is so the features you mean seemed you
can access this defeatism the state in

569
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:55,200
this

570
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:16,550
tourism

571
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:25,170
okay so min tinge demand for the source

572
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,990
so this is the source command it also
Cassandra

573
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,900
a so I so miss you its source for Exeter
password

574
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,300
since do was use to whose work

575
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,420
used to get the source code based on the
secret greens

576
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,500
but since you're doing this was in this
Eagle Creek you could be

577
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:51,500
and their I accept a possible pose for
you

578
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,310
this is among the differences to thank
you

579
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,120
a think taking the if you have any
questions
