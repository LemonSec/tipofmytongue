beginning we start to worry

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,400
personal computers we amassed in the
works

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,130
we moved to smartphones we start to grow
into the eternal beings and a lot of

be pawns for the people that work for

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,610
companies to the

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,810
and talking about cyber warfare many the
company's

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,500
believe that their three-year cycle for
fair believe

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,680
that they are free or interception

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,590
form foreign governments I use so

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,340

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,110
the game information leak from AT&T

44
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,040

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,209
take it by son a former employee AT&T

47
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,730
showing some love the illegal
interception this is really not you

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,510
the market did think that these new
information is leak

49
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,670
the thing that these new East all the
techniques

50
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,110
and technology used for that he's mostly
Lee kid

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,050
and where we are going to see a lot of
new things and

52
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,879
and Chinese during the next into the
next months and years and absolutely

53
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,599
sure about

54
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,620
then so no might points east right to

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,769

to go to the US to the from the teachers
to come from the chairs

73
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,030
but the situation is going to be more
repeatable

74
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,930
if you do if somebody he remember the
case of target

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,800
related to the data breach right in all
the feels

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,970
up the corporate me at the company's
body that this is a mostly financial

89
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,180
as my colleagues explained yesterday in
the other person tations

90
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,190
they talk about the utility companies
this kind assistance

91
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,449
and the internal things is growing more

92
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,530
and more and more and more we are going
to see and may seem

93
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,970
situations and he makes couple years

94
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,289
the seaside free report he's willing to
resting to show to the

95
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,840
CAO to improve the budget

96
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,690
for the eighty and the this is a general
landscape about the financial

97
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,240
in manufacturing professional service
retail nothing

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,100
is free of her keynote that reaches his
not only about government is not only

99
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,110
about financial institutions

100
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,220
this is growing more related to Gina

101
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,509
companies

102
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,520
something that they will want to to
shoot to

103
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,340
to make it weren't for the people who
this is accept the responsibility I know

104
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,900
that most of the people here is
technical

105
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,699
that interesting is that these for
example for target

106
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,870
they spend more than 19 million dollars

107
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,930
tried to fixing the problem of the data
breach

108
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,520
and I am so the dish or do we do they
will not take his morning from the

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,289
payroll of the IT director

110
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,780
finally use a shareholders or the
stakeholders

111
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,800
is this morning is going to be out from
the company

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,800
then something that they won I to where
for the police

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,319
try to getting bowl bid more

114
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,090
with executive idea of the company with
the people that take the decisions

115
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,530
to show more than their final is going
to paying the fines

116
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,710
and the penalties for that late is

117
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,370
going now to the think other stuff in
the light

118
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,430
usually you have expectations you some

119
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,229
people when are children's and
especially boys

120
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,550
request this car this guy no remote
control cars for the father

121
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,560
more there for Christmas or Verde

122
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,970
usually they expect these they did

123
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,889
that for a woman's in a long-term
relationship

124
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,620
after maybe short and I dunno a year's

125
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,830
the specs on the navy's but finally they
get something

126
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,300
like that happened really happened

127
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,740
of course for the graduation when we
leave the college for the new receipt

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,250
the US spec sounding

129
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,720
from these when they finally sometimes
the budget

130
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,849
it's not affordable from the

131
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,879
technical viewpoint on time somebody
tell you say anything you

132
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,110
role for me some very simple cold you
expect something

133
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,180
ladies but finally I get something

134
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,500
like that in foreign sixties

135
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,020
exactly the same situation somebody call
this to the laboratory until he's okay

136
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,280
we have our

137
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,440
a CPU our computer to you do some kind
of France's

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,220
okay we we have a simple power it's okay
no problem motherboard heard right

139
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,240
not be more but then

140
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,430
we was in russia we start to receive

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,250
inside the computer with contacts

143
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,070
in the every corner of the computer when
we opened the

144
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,529
the cop up the computer he destroyed
completely behind right

145
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,850
in Sioux go to one second totally
unusable

146
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,040
this a fatal the hard right absolutely
unrecoverable

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,610
they have the guild battery is

148
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,560

like that

150
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,089
we sold the same devices in Mexico we

SMS destroy the hard drive remotely

156
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,279

remote alarm system they can destroy the
hard drive on three hundred metres away

158
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,310
in case of police search warrants the

159
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,410
nagano time between crashed into and go
inside the place

160
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,589
then this is the kinda really
interesting tools

161
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,630
of course everybody remember CU's the
very old

162
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,610
Trojans that he's improving every day BI
and something like that and then this is

163
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,529
the kind of real Chinese that we're
going to see

164
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,750
diseases most for the higher aside these
is beyond the standard tools

165
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,740
the solution is for Sabres we found some
service and they serve Europe

166
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,029
and he's really interesting because the
the lights can destroy up to

167
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,519
Twain E for hard right at the same time
in Ciudad one second

168
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,690
he said the girls in bras is is they
destroyed completely this week base of

169
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,329
the hard drive

170
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:23,170
totally recoverable really interesting
devices

171
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,959
again in networks something just pick
these

172
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,420
somebody tell you all you need to calm
to the network to make a forensic

173
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,380
animation

174
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,829
where

175
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,470
related to physical hoops sorry

176
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,450
related to physical the situation
something the people to have a use the

177
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,839
recover we receive this kind of a stop
in the laboratory

178
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,440
know anybody beer was hard for this
photo

179
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,870
okay now so why the challenge what is
the new levels

180
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,550
for example for try to detect this kind
of devices for sale that's right you

181
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,149
heard right

182
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,899
we start to use radio frequency the
detectives

183
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,269
inside the computer receive every will
you do he are

184
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,600
were driving remember wifi tools wifi
spike

185
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,140
very useful for these cases you can
detect frequencies

186
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,519
going inside out from the case

187
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,620
on the computer sometimes you need to
replace the platters

188
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,820
up the hard right then you now you can
google it

189
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,850
you can find this kind of tools some
kind of minutes

190
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,870
related to extract the platters inside a
clean room environment

191
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,000
some things were you doing tactical
operations are you have the budget to

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,550
purchase hacking room

193
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,829
you can prepare at less at Liz out work
range

194
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:50,320
acting work bench you can buy in China
for

195
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
I dunno a thousand dollars used to

196
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,459
have a laminar flow of air

197
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,700
to a low to keep clean the idea where
you are

198
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,040
opening heard right then you X you can
meet exacting

199
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,829
reduce our for cleanroom do these can
abrasions

200
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,120
and everyday bad hard drives badly

201
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,540
game digital devices more complex and
and more easy to find

202
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,110
broken then deploy you create our
forensic laboratory in these conditions

203
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,610
actor he's really not hard a platter
exchange tool you can find a market for

204
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,950
by 100 euros on or maybe less

205
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,389
for this case for example this is a SIM
card

206
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,420
we working in some cases when bomb sees
you said

207
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,180
by terrorism back but the recent and
usually we get the

208
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,440
only dessous all the hardware you can
see here this is actually the SIM card

209
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,870
I wanna the contacts is removed that all
the information in the sinker

210
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,930
then with X-rays Anna a good then

211
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,269
microscope you so you can do
microsurgery for recorder

212
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,269
is one option for the No recovery you
can do this kind of

213
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,320
you can use this kind of nan readers

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,750
for the people that work here in
corporate environments and used for

215
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,560
example rate systems

216
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,260
or maybe any will be there have a nasa
your house recorder

217
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,190
us on Namche when I use the memory or
something like that is exactly is

218
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,200
recalling a

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,110
rate is is not very different so you can
use some recycled sum up your knowledge

220
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,050
doing right recording to use cheaper
quality

221
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,589
on these are real interest in password

222
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,139
recall ready to that they saw in China

223
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,600
I to depict to the Chinese
counterterrorism real

224
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,170
is interesting I will chill later

225
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,800
for Palin's recall very for those
they're doing pos recall we

226
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,079
are usually many the laboratories tried
to get bad you to purchase a

227
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,329
rainbow tables you so they're able
tables in the market is costing around

228
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,730
10,000 euros on the lake that not much
people know that you can find

229
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,899
free rental tables you can download all
the patches

230
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,670
not only for a crack you can do to

231
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,610
for PAL recall re: for of these fires
and many of the

232
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,459
last hi sure when you're doing some kind
of forensic stuff

233
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,709
and then these kind of resources and
it's free for everyone

234
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:20,320
niece jus wanna my recommendations in
other cases

235
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,630
you can do man what does Rick already

236
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,990
this is the chair I remember this chair
when I took this photo in China

237
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,100
it was inventing they told me that the
scene and medium

238
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,050
for easy cleaning and they have them
while addition

239
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,199
and the pizza edition I

240
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,320
seeing they need to improve their
marketing given their DVD of the hostel

241
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,949
movie

242
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:50,079
and of course you can add some
additional tools

243
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,630
for improve this be the part recovery
and kenneth starr

244
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,639
there and younger can now

245
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,769
so whether proly we have this kind of of
situations what is the problem right now

246
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,180
in the two friends ex

247
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,570
is really understand the process usually
for the people that work in chain of

248
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,170
custody

249
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,149
or do you change it goes to the in their
corporations for law enforcement

250
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,490
usually you think the back the beings
bring to the laboratory

251
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,260
and every will be fine no right now you
need to start to the

252
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,690
we'd a lot of different processes like
for example my phones

253
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,269
just switching on the phone that is
moving inside the phone

254
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,480
if you take a is is the disc solid state
disk

255
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,810
is exactly the situation is the the the
controller

256
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,110
the hard drive is moving data inside
that you can you can do anything

257
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,610
unless you remove cheap buy cheap on
remote on and try to do

258
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,699
the man a recovery for every on the Nan
right the

259
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:46,550
then this change totally the landscape
on the the press X

260
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,199
every single book that we know about the
forensics

261
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,509
change right now he's just not possible
to follow the previous protocols

262
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,699
that we have related to this caller
don't you all the information I recall

263
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,860
information from the heater forensics

264
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,990
so we have a lot of Chinese about that

265
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,339
10 my recommendations I my personal
opinion he cites a seventeen or twenty

266
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,209
five

267
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,680
but he's one of the standards the
working poor in celebratory say really

268
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,089
really recommend for the people

269
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,290
that he's working seriously for the
different 6

270
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,370
because we can help you to do scientific
process

271
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm group scientific process in
different laboratories many other

272
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,589
laboratories

273
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,649
in the difference is that you can see
were white usually

274
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,470
is certified national nice old nighttime
night thousands

275
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,130
but really eight to nine thousand don't
check the same difficult process and

276
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,120
this is one of my

277
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,110
recommendations for the laboratory
information management system

278
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,740
so now what is the approach

279
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,750
for this kind of a rain CK processors
who

280
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,300
usually when a goal to provide some kind
of training and consulting in forensic

281
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,279
laboratories

282
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,490
we saw more did technical side with and
soul

283
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,360
working hard in density process or the
legal process or even in the integration

284
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,220
between different countries

285
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,620
some of the challenges that we have the
songs sometimes is when

286
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,079
we found somebody hack for example from
basile

287
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,089
or from Russia from crane from Bulgaria

288
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,069
and then try to know the channels to do
the group their way

289
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,329
to do the proper and diamonds

290
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,819
your this search warrant is really
really important key to hear that the

291
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,459
corp in these kind of situations

292
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,080
noun actually the situation that we have
in these differences

293
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,840
is almost impossible that one single guy

294
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,730
can working all the technology different
laboratories we saw all right now

295
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,380
the only ways take people and I
specialize in different thats

296
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,770
like operating systems never broken
systems

297
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,799
more white father is my phones including
the Chinese once

298
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,690
because now is the new challenge not all
the tools can read Chinese phones

299
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,010
and me know the on the phones used by
the crime EC

300
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,390
Chinese phones is due to genetic phones
that can be read

301
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,220
by the standard tools up for the people
that know a bowl to them

302
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,760
hockey nor removing the restrictions on
my phones usually they purchased this

303
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,520
some kinda black boxes

304
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,789
and actually this is the only way to do
some kinda

305
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,610
recovery up these phones interesting
that this is that these

306
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,929
use this kind of black boxes to remove
the restrictions that the phone tank and

307
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:23,600
read

308
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,840
the data from the phones in some
countries actually are

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,640
legal when you go to the police you go
to the pricing departments

310
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,789
are used in desert where you go to some
corporations you fall into boxes because

311
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,850
is the only way to read data

312
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,340
from such kinda fonts reverse
engineering is growing more

313
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,850
and more at been a real a lil for

314
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,610
mother would analyses for political
analyst he sees growing a lot

315
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,660
including of course as my colleagues say
yes to the

316
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,240
all the application servers is growing
he said it's a trend that is growing

317
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,260
more and more

318
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,410
and for different see laboratory

319
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,520
tools for example I feel more analysis &
repair this is something very

320
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,730
interesting not too much people know

321
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,870
that the hard right include the owner
Britain systems

322
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,840
in the pleats up the hard right in more
so the

323
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,350
computer engineering bolt books usually
hard drives starving sector

324
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,480
02 but this is not totally true

325
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,860
the factory label include negative
sectors

326
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,030
means you mean as one usually until May
Knox duty

327
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,530
something like that they include the
operating system from the factory

328
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,940
and its interest in some ball the have
experience listen and knocking knocking

329
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,820
heard right the leap usually all the
hits die or maybe

330
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,030
the more tourists top or maybe the BCE

331
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,289
the printed circuit board I no sometimes
exactly

332
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,809
happen in Windows day operating system
die

333
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,380
you just need to go on repair some of
the models of the rating system

334
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,780
under had right wallop staff to work
again

335
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,480
the interesting thing about the
operating system

336
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,820
factory label and I want to show you
here something

337
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,179
this is actually a date remote control
one of the labs

338
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,710
this is one of the tools that we use for
FEMA Recovery Act is

339
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,429
actually in his money we access at the
sassy gay friend right

340
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:26,559
and the hard drive is talking to get

341
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,309
communication port comport and this is
something touristy

342
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:33,929
not too much people know that the PM's
in sauna the hard-right

343
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:37,409
actually is the communication way so I
can sing

344
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:41,809
Commons factory Commons or stand there
at the Commons to the hard right

345
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,630
to get information or even to the lead
the password the factory password

346
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,250
me know the laptops for the people that
you did the laptop and go to Device

347
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,270
and set up the pass when the bias

348
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,419
this buzzword you know that is not for
sale for use including dippin where

349
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,549
up the hard right something to receive
this kind of hard right on the people

350
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,809
don't know how to remove the password

351
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,370
and then not something interesting with
this kind of tools

352
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,530
number one we can access to special
songs you heard right

353
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,730
we can modify information we can modify
baby a world that hard right

354
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,240
we can do the recorder of the house
right and including do something

355
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,220
interesting

356
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,419
ladies actually the seaside on

357
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,570
has right in we'd

358
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,830
eight hits and we're doing the juice
aisle

359
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,740
recall where you have something there
and interest in a visa stuff he's

360
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,600
sign up the hits is failing we have sown

361
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,900
failures in two hits and then

362
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,260
something that they can do do in
manipulation of the people were

363
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:50,179
the factory feet were companies

364
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,980
something that I can do that when the
manipulation of the up they've been

365
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,750
working hard right

366
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,640
East actually a candle these actually
can switch off

367
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,580
electrical you day head up the hard
right

368
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,490
so I can read this who faces up a
specific I'll size of the hard right

369
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,340
what is the admin touch these if they
have a hard right

370
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,080
and what only ones who faces bro came I
can read all the others who faces

371
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,480
the house right this is a good news when
you're doing recall the forensics

372
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,600
the bad news that the Wii so these kind
of cases in Shanghai

373
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,010
he's a X is something call it black

374
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,470
balks hard drives your computer chasing
the South China

375
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,640
between house on Sun the thousands euros

376
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,110
a box then they took but they take up
front right

377
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,850
from maybe 500 you go it's be removed
the label

378
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,240
they put a label up to 150 you get meets

379
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,530
and the speech of electrically one of
the hits

380
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,960
I can do with a specific software I can
access this is an ideal demand a factor

381
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,750
so when I go to the place to stony
permission movie

382
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,600
information between borders to avoided
taking

383
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,650
risk because if I and using encryption I
am

384
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,080
dressed now reply back to a catch me and
a suspicious guy

385
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,280
so if I don't want to have any kind up
suspicious were awake any kind of

386
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,200
suspicious crossing the border

387
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,970
is simple I just hide information in one
of those who faces on the hard right

388
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,610
is somebody take my head right and make
up for in sick image

389
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,909
is only going to strike the 250
gigabytes

390
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:35,679
from the by 100 guys hard right is
really really interesting

391
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,460
they're my only recommendation easy to
go to China to purchase these kind of

392
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,620
devices please don't use your camcorder

393
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,409
I do that and he's not a good idea

394
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,309
I need to run three days outside shot
high to avoid some kind of problems

395
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:53,520
because they believed I'm going to read
into the police is only that

396
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,559
is is not nice so

397
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,820
these kind of tools is you said to do

398
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,210
did the price recovery at the band's
principle rate but the prelim

399
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,440
you can use these two from the black
side is to hide information deceased an

400
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,100
idea

401
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,220
or is who faces up the hard right so

402
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,460
for example you can see here

403
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,299
but sectors I'm I can see that the hit
three actually the hit three

404
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:24,520
you can really think maybe they had
three is the head with the province

405
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,919
so what they can do I guess only switch
off the kids

406
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,690
3 and I can copy all the older

407
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,770
all the order a hit as our faces

408
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,220
and finally when angry the to war with
Israel faced by

409
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,380
try to recall what this possible if not
I do do %ah had a change

410
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,720
simple this is the kind of Chinese
you're going to confront

411
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,840
is the kind of Chinese you're going to
see but the tools his

412
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,179
3d in available on us I told you

413
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,179
something the research for example is
specifically to this a gay cases

414
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,980
is you want to play you just need to
connect to the comp port

415
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,440
on the computer you can connect directly
to you heard right

416
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,370
you can delete it lead to the hard right
is really really interesting

417
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,029
the factory comments on the cable how
you can change the behavior of the hard

418
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,789
right

419
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:17,750
arcane then this is related to the
Fillmore

420
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,570
analysis and repair right

421
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,890
of course we have another Chinese like

422
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,279
more iPhone see-saw where to baghdad the
the the the more iPhones

423
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,770
if I have up 100 phones or anyone

424
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,029
only one single phone and they want to
avoid the South

425
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:40,380
destruction of the poncho this MS for
example you catch

426
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,890
your company or you know operation

427
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,289
I'm on my phone and you want to avoid a
game

428
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:50,559
the people's an SMS to destroy the phone
you need to use a game

429
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,130
but I cage for those who are electrical
engineers

430
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,330
something he doesn't remember these very
very best concept

431
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,360
about the copter cage

432
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,720
again is working here is the best way
some people some of my

433
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,960
am police use it active yes and blockers

434
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,640
that's something to happen usually with
the acted yes im blockers

435
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,970
when you you to the electricity unblock
all the

436
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,029
for Bantam yes'm is sometimes

437
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,669
like go out is a blackout and then

438
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,220
usually to nom de the to after this I
miss

439
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,740
and delete and white completely diff one

440
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,450
we have been I have a lot of cases in
these what is the address was about like

441
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,480
a shitty

442
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,870
his posse you need batteries or
electricity to operate

443
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,059
you just need copper cage and it's all

444
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,350
simple solutions for complex problems

445
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,510
then our readers as these kind of
devices

446
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,559
allow you to read one by one cheap buy
cheap

447
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,860
for example you have a use be the
challenge

448
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,760
when you're doing not recall for you is
act when you done not

449
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,260
X's any kind of is pander algorithm

450
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,960
for stored information and sheeps then

451
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,240
companies like sony's some some Siemens

452
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,720
use everyone uses own algorithms to
which store the information on the

453
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,559
cheaps

454
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,809
so you need to think a lot of coffee in
Redwood

455
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,140
way you are trying to do some kinda
rivers and unity to require that

456
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,110
the good news is you can do it the bad
news is you

457
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,990
you invoices for coffee and Red Bull we
grow more

458
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,440
because every morn they are releasing
new keeps and union readers have all

459
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,559
that

460
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,250
spectrum analyzers I recommended
sometimes

461
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,470
as I told you we you get a black box

462
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,110
use that power i computer and you have
no idea I saw these inside

463
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:49,059
please room the whites by fears or on
any spectrum analyzers you can find

464
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:49,770
evening

465
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,630
cheaper spectrum analyzers innovate or
something like that

466
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,090
remember actually we so that they can
answer on your the gulf side for this to

467
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,529
have dry but the somebody have been nice
idea

468
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:02,960
to boot c4 explosive close to the

469
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,440
Stathis eileen is no good to bring this
kind of stuff to the laboratory

470
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,340
right an absolute so we're going to see
these kind of situations in the future

471
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,649
more by multiplexers for those to
working very old networks

472
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:18,860
maybe I use the N we have a lot of

473
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,620
small China's with 64 kilometers we need
to pull together to have lunch at one

474
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,399
single channel

475
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,690
a game multiplexers is working

476
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,000
forma y broadband sometimes what we're
doing some kind of tactical operations

477
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,049
already being do infers working for some
corporations that we have no

478
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,200
we can use for example the broken up the
company we need to use X 10 min network

479
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,440
we camp look for FY yes and Muslims

480
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,980
and act like one Cup final lot of tools
right now to do my multiplexers

481
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,600
even you are using 4G or 3G

482
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,659
or LTTE or umps

483
00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:00,120
some ties the brother knees and she's
not be noticing information then

484
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,990
more by multiplexer is a very useful
tool if you are you keen

485
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,020
for transfer high-speed information in
line it works

486
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,279
some boxes of course orders that we GNE
reverse engineering

487
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,419
I think that he's there differs 8 give

488
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,260
but now for for the people that is
working for forensic laboratories

489
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,320
that these more

490
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,070
the heavy is more related to war we

491
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,149
their evidence Disney I take the hard
right I

492
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:33,159
made if resignation and it's all and a
working the dead evidence

493
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,730
but all the new buyers his on the new
model where that only start

494
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,649
with the computer boot the only way is
going to start the evidence

495
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:45,970
uses tired evidence to see the cable at
the protocol label

496
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,450
at the kennel label and that the memo
delivered is no other way

497
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,370
to that day and saw all the people is
working with forensics please

498
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,770
see some boxing some other people is
using be aware yes

499
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,860
useful or use built on machines

500
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,940
you can see the will be he bore behind
that so some books in the south

501
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,570
extraordinary good too

502
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,000
to try to do some kind of reverse
engineering or

503
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,529
behavior or behind physical evidence in
that case is now working poor

504
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:19,990
this song cycle sign-on authentication I
jus recommended here because in my

505
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,029
experience

506
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,669
we saw especially in some cases not in
america

507
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:30,169
we saw a whole set up the evidence in
forensic laboratories was takin

508
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:34,390
by some other forensic analysts and what
cell to the press

509
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,289
and you can imagine the kind of the
scandals and the whole these made

510
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,860
a lot of noise for the 14c case

511
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,980
so please use authentication please
include the hard drive to the forensic

512
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,190
to work stations

513
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,260
because usually people he's copying data
from there

514
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,679
10 depressions that we have been some
continuity in american

515
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,779
on the provide some evidence

516
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,640
some cream in a group and interesting is
that he's

517
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,470
the evidence into the virus date infect
the food laboratory

518
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,600
and it's tough to copy all that from the
laboratory to know which cases they're

519
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,440
working for

520
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,299
so form interestingly the compute had
the buzzword

521
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,640
they have no any kind of protection so
they can axis

522
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,220
anytime because the computers in a
bunker actress Anna

523
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,710
physical concur but they forget the
Internet yes I know

524
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,320
people say oh KY connect a forensic lab
to the Internet

525
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,809
simple because you can't activate the
keys the license keys with old

526
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,110
internment and because usually you need
update anti-virus

527
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,429
and usually they most above the law
enforcement don't want to bring and use

528
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,809
the with all the updates

529
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,240
in in at on the right to do that then
he's more simple used to block to know

530
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,000
what are you

531
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,549
yes happen I know that these against all
the recommendations

532
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:53,890
but II and tried to talk here about the
real cases in our use and not talking

533
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,779
about

534
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,250
whole look nice in a book of police's or
politics

535
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,610
related to print the lab and then many
of the problems that we saw in different

536
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,890
laboratories that

537
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:09,679
he won interesting case like two years
ago I think so

538
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,090
I was Calif new urgency I was in green
need to travel

539
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,419
soon as possible very special case

540
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:20,230
in another country because the fool or a
Tory

541
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,220
is frozen is nothing is working is the
hub for Sabres doing the Christian for

542
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,659
the patient 24 by 7

543
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:30,440
and he said stop it they have all the
workstations topping and they not not be

544
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,789
them they have no idea what is going on

545
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,010
finally we go to see their workstations
interest in his Wii phone

546
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,890
age of Empires biggest edition you when
all the workstations

547
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,500
when we asked for one of the guys the
working the night

548
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,000
say that he's very boring and you have
no idea what to do

549
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,669
they had no internet happening here in
now by the CBD and the

550
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:57,769
the thing they do that the is spread the
virus in all day forensic laboratory

551
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:02,110
and stop Avery single process

552
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,360
the interesting but the situation is
when you were doing password decryption

553
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,179
we'd them law enforcement a rebel tables

554
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:15,120
Sunday that you stop the process usually
you need to start a game

555
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,130
not all the tools can resume where they
go

556
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,110
and a contaminated everything so process

557
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,519
that these were keen seven months
breaking passwords

558
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,539
they need to start over again the guy
West Saint

559
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:33,960
to the most far fire away part of the
country

560
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,330
you can imagine it can reveal that but

561
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,010
believe he's not exactly happy but
really happened this is the kind of

562
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,809
situation there really happen for a
premies

563
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:47,760
someday so like a joke because you
believe normally these issues is taboo

564
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,850
this issue that the people the stunning
gains in the parade lap yes

565
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,929
issues after one person is 12 hours in
front a computer

566
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:59,769
use looking they progress bar become
bored

567
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:02,840
especially when he's one person

568
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,149
and the hours later 2 percent and 30
later

569
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:10,629
3 percent somethings to the pipe

570
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:15,329
I'm is powerful that the mining

571
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:19,730
okay so what is another experience we
start to see doing cases in forensics

572
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,780
ease on usually the cases in the
laboratory is working us

573
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,129
isolated cases these me if I catch one
queen and I

574
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,020
I process his evidence and other guy

575
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,859
evidence and everything is separate the
interest in the staff is when we start

576
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,460
to play with multi-angle

577
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,169
is hoping source intelligence to lease
and it's free so consoles

578
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:45,320
and as many others we stack to found
something very interesting and he's the

579
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,849
relationships

580
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:51,929
all good relations seats between on the
relationship between the cases

581
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,599
and then use the data mining in in cases
is really

582
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,440
really extremely useful Lisa good
accommodation I do

583
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,820
this is another example of tools for a
do

584
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,619
on recovery you can see here

585
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,460
this is likely that the motherboard of
it is as the these

586
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,700
you to remove one by one and put the
here I'm

587
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,980
peace for lose that he's workin

588
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,510
doing re-learning the capsule ation

589
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,310
that these the process of removed for
example if they have a cheap

590
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,400
and he's a broken leg I need to take the
cheap

591
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,290
and do like some kind of microsurgery to
take directly the information from there

592
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,130
for these I need to use a special
chemicals for that even the information

593
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,930
you can phone

594
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,690
good the problem with this is extremely
dangerous

595
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,180
chemicals caps on Fresno State two or
even three days in the hospital

596
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,130
doing this in the bathroom well the
house

597
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,589
because they had tried to learn because
you need this closest basin is so many

598
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:54,010
that

599
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,420
and then please you're going to do that
please don't do in the bathroom

600
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,880
his note is really in a good idea or at
very close to space

601
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,730
and peas with restrictions up the
chemicals the good news is you can

602
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,240
recover

603
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,450
no me neither be the chief is Brock am
the good they

604
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,099
the good thing is the good news you can
recover the bad news is you can die in

605
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:12,960
the process

606
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,650
but he's not a problem for some people

607
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:21,400
this is actually a hard right and the
hits the something explain before

608
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,540
been really is a lot of me tix I'll

609
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,750
about the needs about the hard right I
will have greater caller that they had

610
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,680
writings

611
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,109
is them company displays that these a
back room inside that is not true

612
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,530
attorneys a lot of air him citing say
they had right

613
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,310
and then the good news is you can recall
order had rights

614
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,970
and the bad news is you need to study
lot to that

615
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,020
something for example we one drive-bys

616
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,240
inside the weather know me the result
levy

617
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,290
or or sweet whether you can recall any
you can

618
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,690
find the key me cussed it clean this
will face you need the season fire the

619
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,220
hard way you can do the recovery

620
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,790
I'm sure this for you because some
people believe that he's not possible to

621
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,640
recover de beers

622
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,869
especially fiscal evidence were broken
physical evidence

623
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:14,460
so this is a good news to research into
were for

624
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,670
as I explained the sister Nadia a

625
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,770
worked through at the Commons actually
the Atacama

626
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,180
is up hope in a standard that you can
see him the your team that

627
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,570
or all these standers understand that
protocol

628
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,630
to war told with a hard right deeply

629
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,250
right so you can flash and these
interesting stuff

630
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,480
you can't be being hide information in
the classroom they had ranks

631
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
then he's is interesting thing to do the
security race common

632
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,740
ISE very well no comment

633
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,099
for the house right especially to feel
with see what this will face of the

634
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,369
house right this is a factory process

635
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:58,050
to certified that this will face its
okay the broader Nissan of the bad guys

636
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,609
is you seen this process to override the
forehead right

637
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,210
and do it recordable then the Z's
another challenge

638
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,500
this is just one example love them the
are the dirty

639
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,760
and other recommendations likes me
before the open source intelligence is a

640
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,349
extremely useful tool Andrea useful tool
for forensic laboratories

641
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:22,290
or for any kind of investigation the use
all right now even many government is

642
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,170
working

643
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,270
in Delhi a is doing intelligence told
these kind of tools

644
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,650
right must take boys have really useful
tool they recommend is open source

645
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,839
every week and all up on the web site
other the company's to

646
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,240
nice old African people right

647
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,270
of course he anymore to for the
laboratory

648
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:45,099
is that tourists are things like the
injection of cold inside a

649
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:50,140
is that you have of course I the pro is
wheel or by the pros is the bass

650
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,579
reversing getting to XD having some
right

651
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,810
an upgrade to some people Katlin here
somewhere

652
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,410
think or let me wait some very good
resolves RAM deeply your

653
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,570
to get information about dddd stuff

654
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,000
okay so finally my conclusions he's

655
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,619
please do teamwork your forensic team do
research beyond the standard channels

656
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,869
might go on today as I explain in the
beginning is just put the seed

657
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:21,070
in the people that want to work Harrell
your research more

658
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,609
in different fields right he said lot of
tools

659
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:28,109
if anyone ages 12 told me after the
conference is my pleasure to share my

660
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:29,290
knowledge

661
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,310
I'm not collecting to the street

662
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,460
so a go beyond the standard channels

663
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,079
the wat reverse engineering different
laboratories really really

664
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,859
an extremely useful right now right
Abyan where

665
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:45,960
on physical isolation up the machines

666
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,849
to work to put the evidence

667
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,050
like the evidence right I'm going to
South that sell the solution techniques

668
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,369
thanks lynn before the Gulf Shores
physical the cultures

669
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:00,940
they can destroy the did right right
already in South were

670
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,540
that software that can activate itself
just 270 fake

671
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,690
their certification factory that is that
alright with you the hard right

672
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,770
whether he explained that because one of
the rules of forensic sees if the

673
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,920
computer lease on

674
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,020
don't switch off yes this is true but
not

675
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,270
you think computers that to do this at
self-destruction

676
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,400
all the or overwriting or deformation

677
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,410
right and then this is something to keep
in mind right

678
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,819
had were hacking as I so before is a lot
of

679
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:32,170
a game it's a lot of picnics

680
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,569
right a lot of Fame however tweaks

681
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:39,869
for this kind of stuff they will I will
try to show something

682
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:43,200
that me %um

683
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,480
neither with you use one three-day want
to share with your wrist

684
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,480
is too close when me know

685
00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:01,670
just want to show you

686
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,170
yes this is a nice example

687
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,400
of hardware hacking for texting cases
these

688
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,619
actually at use be hard right right you
can see the interface your

689
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:20,890
the problem knees if I'm going to access
the

690
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,980
back to label up such hard right I can
do through the use be

691
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,020
because the use the controller can send
the at the Commons

692
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,740
to the head right so what they need to
do the good enough China

693
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,210
especially this all the you can find a
diagrams of utmost

694
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:40,430
every electronic in the planet and then
you can find the schematics

695
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,630
love these models LIBOR are you can Luke

696
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,619
and so they're PDT to them or their bore
all the above the dried

697
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:51,010
this kind of thing this is actually a
South iconic to

698
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:54,270
and when I do that I have beaded axis

699
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,440
the back to deliver in the hard right
this is one of the techniques he said

700
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,119
asked me for prizes the the good point
that this possible

701
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,470
exxon of the cases in the laboratory
when he received from a she's OK

702
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,010
have easy way can do I can connect they
can axes the fact 11

703
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,450
okay always always exits away

704
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,809
right this is used to the closer their

705
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:20,200
cocaine then of course like I think any
duration

706
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,230
to see what I can do if I need to do a
chain of custody

707
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,099
try to walk with the coming to cite the
world a que niece

708
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:31,150
the hackett community have a nap and
knees resource of information to share

709
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,869
with the people and absolutely sore

710
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:37,160
in the future will be more integration
into society and absolutely sure about

711
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,740
that

712
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,950
the Chinese that is going on did during
the next year it's going to be more

713
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,680
and more bigger going to see in the news
and then

714
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,079
unification did the work in the research
together as he's very very important for

715
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,210
the well-off family

716
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,599
right then finally work on ideas
researcher

717
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,950
join efforts and if anybody have a
question

718
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:04,700
thank you here
