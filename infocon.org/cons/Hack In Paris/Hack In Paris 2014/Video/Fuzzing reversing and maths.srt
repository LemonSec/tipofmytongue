1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,980
and we are going to talk about crossing
River cinemas

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,500
this is a our agenda and that the peace
that we are going to talk about the

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,440
during his presentation so first of all

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,380
who we are Association am in a midget B

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,340
an imposition just answered with a
researcher at the light on who grew up

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,470
in security

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,269
I'm also upper beak for some you have my
blog

8
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,689
to tack on an email going to want to
contact me

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,800
no pennies per year competition there's
there's a good year said

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,180
and a nigger and this is a great
addition he was known

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,719
and the city's or a real and min

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,170
you wonder what that mean okay

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,260
what this book is about this turkey sub
out:

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,000
our research team backup servers and
white pickup service

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,510
will because we think they are critical
for companies

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,620
backup server some backup plans because
if you fuck

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,120
or compromise our pick up Sarah back up
claims you could

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,590
compromise hand in tech company also
because they are so let's get this over

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,500
so they should be secure right but as
you probably know

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,380
on as you would see during the
presentation they are not secure hope

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,390
then we start to use this backups are
releasing we could be a

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,299
as you can see in the right where we
come final at the fair

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,110
different backup for looks from
different vendors and we found

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,920
several a on their reducing at the
backup applications

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
here when work we are going to talk
about their respective because on their

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,220
knows a plan to pick up by the course we
found and under the and he's using other

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,579
products but we won't talk about them
because we don't have enough time

28
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,829
because of legal issues as well but the
important thing here is that

29
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:53,220
using these techniques that we're going
to talk about here you will find

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,340
venero this in a lot of other products
on this is for sure

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,000
okay so let's start this year the party

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,670
there on the fixes for the save money
reduce it that's way because

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,000
been thirsty and tried to contact us so
same we want to show you how we do how

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,889
we fund this kind of a issues

35
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,099
step-by-step and then you will find more
in other perks for sure

36
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:21,040
on that bike aprox least on we know that
I love you are with people on use these

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,349
issues with evil intent

38
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,379
on I'm of course we won't be responsible
your

39
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,200
you with a BS universal what I want to
allow these

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,629
not understand what up sir the summer a
place that we will use

41
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,660
in my nasa as you can see in the sum was
paid will have to do that

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,540
NC double 1 month ago through this bet
was solid

43
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,260
cement were as you can see the copyright

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,319
a in the passing of fun summer

45
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,519
these asthma corruption stuff but no my
buddies were report

46
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,720
seen 2008 so the season yeah it was a
report anyone ID

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,890
opinion these so much time a lot of rest
at me

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,790
there said women that there was a
request to respond using gonna be

49
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,120
but with gonna be a race it's amazing to
and he's

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,170
you can see that the property by some
weren't gonna be

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,290
weekend them play with almost anything
in this bizarre

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,400
on the left you can see there is if I so
would I'm on the right you can see

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,080
they're gonna be love

54
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,510
milieu have a7 o'clock and

55
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,760
to this but the Dixie the server but the
plane that this is the client

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,030
and English to listen you have to the
bus were I was never interested in it

57
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,420
too

58
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,159
you blame me so this message about day
and his day

59
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,069
the screen at the gonna be okay so

60
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,340
we know the plans have to send a
buzzword deserve it why because if you

61
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,230
don't mind but we're in the money box

62
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,209
others ever in once any bug so is
everyone now has the bus waiting anybody

63
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:56,989
said

64
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,010
but when the planes in the bus were okay
you know this

65
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,239
every these is better and went

66
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,510
when the client died to the server they
do up

67
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,680
it so the but they say by imposing

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,739
business Callisto and that they miss me
miss me if I this year

69
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,410
the is this another another bucket

70
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,419
that the claim send

71
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,460
the server and related but where is he

72
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,690
did decided is but the we gonna be

73
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,479
we realized that these bites the a the
eight

74
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,820
baby stuff unlikely but about that

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,300
so we're going to sue them for the
controversy innovate on the hollywood

76
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,790
a good a

77
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,419
in this case we use but points in their
previous and be fun since

78
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,570
and then go further in the debugger to
pick up with two

79
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,190
but the cumbersome as you can see here
in the the left

80
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,889
we have then put it back in the canopy
look

81
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,650
thank you have in the debugger and when
the function

82
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,100
victory is called around and we look at
the buffer we will be able to

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,310
to see attempted to pack it in the
memory dump as you can see here

84
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,949
okay you have their political heather's
and

85
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,229
and get it back so %uh so seen

86
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,400
the you see how r britt points we don't
find the functions

87
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,840
with under the so good we are looking up
for example in the read the packet here

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,320
in the first bite if we said have a
break point in the a bite

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,760
and when any instruction will try and

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,349
to read the writing these bite we the
debugger will stop

91
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,020
on we will be able to see what is going
on and doing these we found this

92
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,370
interesting function

93
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,960
which the group include the packet been
some

94
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,050
HR operations on

95
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,310
cue have the Tupac can de Maria

96
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,789
so the

97
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,340
our mingle here very now it's where's
the bus were in these they put it back

98
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,840
in now

99
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,840
as you can see here we were doing so far

100
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,940
this with the bus were test and the
password this one

101
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,110
on we realized that these up as
warehouse

102
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,789
Okies four bytes bus route bus warehouse
so for you

103
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,599
if we are able to the previous pocket
using an exploit and get the house

104
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,970
we will have upon their eighty you won't
be a really big

105
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,289
and primarily to get but unease air

106
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,099
it's ever going to start so we need
something think I'm reverse the whole

107
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:26,210
process here

108
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,710
and then we found three important
functions here and is it ok to call

109
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,680
these functions

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,590
now our mingled series how is the house

111
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,770
back at the grid because we want to wait
and explode know that to get the house

112
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,490
any plant in the sophomore then we found
this function

113
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,960
the funds from one and the scenes from
the calibrations for test the

114
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,560
she flipped she's right on or and so on

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,460
you will couple 84 bytes you seen as a
parameter

116
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,490
the following 32 bytes key this is dead
32 bytes key

117
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,789
and these key is the claim Burcham
that's the claim postname

118
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,479
Plessis that the key remember that the
time for some the time hostname

119
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,780
we we got this information from the
claim on this that the key

120
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,979
we found it in the barracks a constant

121
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,219
as you can hear as you can see here
South 32 bytes contact consent

122
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:23,409
and it's always the same their summer
fun soon the function to

123
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,159
as you can see here the cold a surreal
loops on

124
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,760
it with the four bytes from france from
one assignment you will generate

125
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,680
I want answered on 24 bite every as you
can see here and

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,860
in a memory dump then there's another
function the function 3

127
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,029
and with their last right from France in
two snowmen

128
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,370
you will create another a rate of one
person that for by the rate

129
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,090
doing some X operations between the left
or right from France into

130
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,650
on this wiki remember this cutie was the
camber simplistically

131
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,349
person employed that is that the key
then to find someone who will

132
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:03,279
it will be called a game and doing the
same legal abrasions

133
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,950
and using its not mean the last every
from France on three he will generate

134
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,010
another four bytes

135
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,190
then the function to he would call the
game on with the last

136
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,889
for rice from france someone he will
generate another and every

137
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,169
I'm finally the funds from three the

138
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,860
doing some extra rations between the
last every from France into

139
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,740
and include the packet you would agree
to buy gift okay

140
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,800
so as to marry you have this graph it's
pretty simple

141
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
we have three functions and they will be
called twice

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,900
and then on a very important thing that
we

143
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,790
really need here for all works but is
this Ricky here's a summary

144
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,760
every woman response to the study is the
key remember I think he's done but with

145
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,850
Liam Messam

146
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,550
the issue and the plane causing palace
at the key

147
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,839
but we found Nevada so we have
everything we can raise Brainerd

148
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,920
we were interested

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,120
rains bring her to the difference but
was running claimed so is not

150
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,520
do we just need to secure the funds in
1283 uneasy with the Panthers

151
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,020
day with work this is the

152
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,390
first packet that we have to send and in
the client respond with the plane was

153
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,699
handed

154
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:21,120
that we have to send this and I have
been but did

155
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,819
and these responds with these like
contain

156
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,310
he has so we're going to put all these
together an abutment

157
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,120
this is the by then go to the Senate and
they sell

158
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,270
on this simply go by the response and
one

159
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,569
this is fun to do is another

160
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,709
by representation of the same legal the
funds in due course

161
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,430
and is defined the funds in 30 days
another Michael

162
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,810
assembled festival have to so some
requirements

163
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,110
we don't mind the meal we just need to
send the packet to

164
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,750
to the client them have the same another
packet

165
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,860
basic unit monsoon I'm finally with the

166
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,860
house opening lines and to see you in a
team

167
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,230
cases the cold

168
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,510
is awkward respect and we went to secure
the

169
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:35,470
despite in this is the the key

170
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,630
and this is going to the packet

171
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,960
and into the provides the firm 21

172
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,140
great I was first therapy

173
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:55,140
this is the

174
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,650
purse by Kent and then the first they
claim fortunately I met him

175
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,200
after the signing up in bucket give us

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,270
and packet account in the house

177
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,900
on finally hours keep

178
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,779
have 20 it is the critical packet

179
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,620
I'm save you can get a this house

180
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:25,620
in this case you missus us

181
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,310
so

182
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,380
now we have the ability to get the house
to finish line okay

183
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,230
but what can we do with these hos as you
can see here

184
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,800
we have the house of the bus were tests
on the price of the password is one

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,660
it's always for Vice Haas on it sings at
all as you can see here

186
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,330
so he suffered bites haha so we have
four be impossible

187
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,680
unique bus course and a maximum of their

188
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,940
reducer respect but we're getting these
the

189
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,680
31 carter's on we can use moralist and
ninety possible characters

190
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,710
on this bus were so at this is the
number of their posture but between

191
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,490
application

192
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,630
which is really big on take back on this
number

193
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,080
on the for vice versa the collision
number is this one

194
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,600
which is really really because well even
more than atoms on their

195
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,010
so is really weak an ass you probably
could be thinking right now

196
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,590
yes this is her I need your love
vulnerability

197
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,150
by the press will try to go further in
these then that we found a house

198
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,970
function

199
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,840
I which is a fun someone we know more or
less some leaders have a response from

200
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,200
but will try to explain

201
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,490
more details and or the Fun Center in
the following slides

202
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:43,480
I on dysfunction would take us not mean
they're clear text password which is

203
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,240
in this case is best okay on

204
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,680
he will do some legal persons to see
fleshed seabright

205
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,590
on or then you will multiply a.m.

206
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,810
it will do I'm to be getting off the
cutter for the bus were

207
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,000
by itself and then he will do on annex
for a free sim

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,060
on when they're fun to use a stick
executed

209
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,460
it will generate the house of the bus
were as you can securely in the

210
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,840
yes register so with these

211
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,550
how come we fine a vulnerability here
our hong kong exploit these

212
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,480
Wellington through that we need to use a
mouse

213
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,490
you have to find someone else to go

214
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,490
which is easier for us to understand and
we have to look carefully at life I from

215
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,780
at like seven in line at seven we have
today

216
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,210
extirpation of their and with the
because not they cut their

217
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,460
the bus were by itself we'll talk about
the suppression later

218
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,340
but now we have to focus on line 5 where
we have this leaflet

219
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,410
operation they are very soon the sea
freight abrasion on the

220
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,770
on 3 operation here on three operation
we think that their developers try to

221
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,250
use

222
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,890
these and as a mask in order to protect
the beast during the rotation

223
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,680
but as you probably know three binary
2011

224
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,130
and any on the bridge in with your in
the result you will have a zero and

225
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,490
that's where ABC's her failure

226
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,630
because if you want to protect all the
peace during their addition in this

227
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,870
particular case they must

228
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,280
should be seven because seven is 111
there's no sir

229
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,600
and you of I threw in the result you
have

230
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,450
the Telegraph where we have the

231
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,510
the 32 beats of the Haas or the 32 bits

232
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,860
of their resold variable in this cold up
before the rotation

233
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,950
on the because have the

234
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,290
how the British in works on and the most
important thing because of the

235
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,520
and three promoted is there a team and

236
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,190
in the first iteration of the loop at
they beat

237
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,420
to will be erased okay

238
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,730
and then the five and then the big

239
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,740
lemon and so on and that's what

240
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,140
we come bill a password with scarce in
Pasadena

241
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,440
easy way okay you have

242
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,270
this graph this graph we are going to
use is refered to

243
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,530
X exploit and explain how it works you
have

244
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,589
well and this crap sorry represents how
the beats

245
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,780
are erased in funds from one if you have

246
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,140
the 32 be tough for the house and
remember that we have the house

247
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,920
we have the lead to get the house open
again so we have to get the house open

248
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,130
again so we have lit

249
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,120
the beats he would have the 30 the
excellent of the bus when the

250
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,010
application which is

251
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,740
31 cut this so sane we will try tonight

252
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,820
a 3-1 length password which serves the
same house if you remember in fashion

253
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,830
when we have we have

254
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,860
and we have these and their operation DX
or

255
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,030
of them with the baton to cut their of
the bus or by itself

256
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,959
and that's why we will use carter's 2934
our new bus were

257
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,700
because Scott the two and three in
excess amount multiply by themselves

258
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,750
will have these binary numbers

259
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,270
and we will use the third law was
beating this binary numbers

260
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,640
let's see how it works for example we
have as ear

261
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,860
in this house bead in this particular
case if you want to start from the

262
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,520
let's cut the buzzword the number thirty
will have to use one

263
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,600
these two binary numbers starting from
hear from the lowest bid

264
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,250
I will have in this particular case will
have to put on

265
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,860
the same beat in the back is clear that
we have in this and a high-speed

266
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,720
so in this case is here will use the
Carter three and now we are selling

267
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,829
their house between this case

268
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,420
the following cut there's will use will
use the same

269
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,310
a logic but also we have to take into
context corporation

270
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,040
for example if we have here i won in
this high-speed

271
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,430
will have in to putting this back at
square beat

272
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,180
with the weeds doing an exhibition
between these be done

273
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,329
all the beats which are below are the
same column

274
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:53,010
their result has to be the same as this
one for example here would

275
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,660
jere XR between 0&1 they were so will be
one

276
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,910
so now here we we are answered in their
hearts beat

277
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,290
as well and the following potential uses
in late thinking they're gone

278
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,500
decks or person up this be done all the
beats with Harbhajan Singh column

279
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,750
again and again on in the last case

280
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,380
forgot their 0 will you sir and their
own unique

281
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,209
and because we have to fix or put two
beats

282
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,380
and that's why because if you remember
we have 32 has beats

283
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,760
on 31 Carter said in the bus were so
because of that difference that's why we

284
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,300
got

285
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,919
we have to to boot to beat

286
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,800
and also will use cutters in this case
two three four and six because

287
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,990
using those cart this we will have all
the possible combinations in the binary

288
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,310
numbers

289
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,480
for example if we have a1 a0 here

290
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,950
will have to start from here from those
bit like always

291
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,690
on a will have to put in the box where
be tweets

292
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,160
doing an ex or praise Him between these
be done all the beads which are below

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,810
are the same column

294
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,540
as you can see here in this weather
redline the result has to be the same

295
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,080
at this one I hear the same I'm putting

296
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,210
all this lady together in Argo tea from

297
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,210
we will be able to be in a password
which church is impossible

298
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,370
in a seaway the this is had the cold
it's pretty simple we are you seeing

299
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,400
Carter 2&3

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,380
on courtesy 6 it to 304

301
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,380
for the last case the car here but the

302
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,650
the best way to show you how it works to
the matter should be

303
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,150
but first full like always repairman
suite on the main the media as you know

304
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,510
we just need a.m. the house which we got
from exploit one

305
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,820
and we will be the bus were which has
the same house

306
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,290
on will use their respects her murder
trial version which is free

307
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:49,290
entree talk this to recline the city how
it works

308
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,960
okay you have the server we are up in
the plane

309
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,960
in the IP 69 and a plane is asking for
the password this is that a feud between

310
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,270
the claim them

311
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,429
the server and now

312
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,200
just approved will use the bus were dead
which is

313
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,290
that'll pass or of the crime just
disapprove

314
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,620
copy would be here

315
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,380
to cooking if you have the traffic
between the client and the server

316
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,570
and as you can see there are a lot
computer packets will talk about the

317
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,929
simply too packets leader

318
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:40,419
a hue have the counterpart of the guy
and we can pick up to lose

319
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,390
on everything's working that's okay now

320
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,900
we will to lead to the client and we
will at it again this AM

321
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,510
AP others AP 69 again

322
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,530
the Kings asking for the password on now
will use

323
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,309
our explode I'll will use the

324
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,799
on this from similar to calculated their

325
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,929
at the house of the bus were tested dust
has approved but

326
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,950
remember that we have to read look at
the house of unclaimed aren't we will

327
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,919
pass the house

328
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,720
to these minor and a binary will give us

329
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,400
a bus were 31 mince pies were with
sources him past

330
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,970
as you can see here good

331
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,770
copy you

332
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,110
to prove people have

333
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,230
as we're based

334
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,169
here okay

335
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,530
now here we have taken to open up the
Glen but if

336
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,960
we look carefully at the canopy look we
can see that did

337
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,590
servers trying to send an increase the
packet to the client and the client is

338
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,210
not responding so something's not going
work here

339
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,679
and if we click tools in the control
panel for the client

340
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,040
we will have this number error so the
finale

341
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,580
something is not going well here seaway

342
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,660
is a respected

343
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,760
30 the plant you senator belittle with
them

344
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,640
request/response response so is that the
thing that increasing numbers using the

345
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,270
brim

346
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,550
that made this possible as the as if it
was a big issue and you can see the bus

347
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,650
go to the client

348
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,090
okay do is understand we realize the

349
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,000
diana's personal information to the
server in order to this event has to

350
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,530
know the password and you scenes about
this

351
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,540
finally and this to pass course hey this
is a

352
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,610
possible we'd has the same house

353
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,140
as you can see in the screen but pasa
this for a vice

354
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,919
completely different so we know that
these that isn't the clay and we have to

355
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,980
set the password

356
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,240
as a willing to take wouldn't be much
client indonesia is your mind but they

357
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,190
will have to listen to me by slim

358
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,600
we realize how we see the san vincente

359
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,820
so upset about this possible that could
be interesting because he's we called

360
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,860
the first time that we going to change
the password

361
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,400
i'm following this month's human would
realize the

362
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,690
will be call the summer fun too because
blow is a key ingredient Lee

363
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,380
so we're going to lose the however Hall

364
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,690
what is the sponsor bed you have largely
depends on one

365
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,380
remain friends in well with it and
reappraisal home

366
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,540
and see right and so on the beach at the

367
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,330
we realized that he defines into with
many loops to and that would increase

368
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,610
the pension 3

369
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,309
with exploration on their own and soul
so is the day in the middle but

370
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:52,620
again I D somehow with the pain as
possible using our FEMA funds in 100

371
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,910
so into fine how these my bike generated

372
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,480
and we make at this at this with but
were tested

373
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,740
on we're going to see with you said
Howell

374
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,620
how these for my advice will be in the
80 you see me up bro and DB server

375
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,020
in

376
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:19,020
sorry okay

377
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,380
you have they the pro we are using their

378
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,190
debugger find a pro we have updated
their the line is claiming you seen

379
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,790
deliver GB said: DB server dealings
efforts between

380
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,840
on things asking for the first time
response were

381
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,670
I'm but we typed their taste buds were

382
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,720
and the phone someone

383
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,540
he will be called and using this moment
as you get here

384
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,870
in the cleartext password and Emery them
then

385
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,960
when he secured it will generate the
house of the bus were this is not new

386
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,560
for us

387
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,500
and then the funds into it will be
executed

388
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,130
and using this indictment the house of
the password you can secure in the

389
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,750
memory them

390
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,790
again this is not new for us

391
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,300
it will generate they want the sentence
for by director

392
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,730
on them

393
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,960
defines him three to scold

394
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,650
Creed

395
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,320
doing create using the sacrament

396
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,700
the the last every from France into of
funds into

397
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,280
undeclared experts were and this is new
for us

398
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,240
okay and it's important we'll see what
you will

399
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,910
generate another 1,000 in the 4-byte a
rare

400
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,270
I'm finally

401
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,570
defines him three which is the funds
from one again sorry the passbook

402
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,630
he will be

403
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,690
it will be executed using the time in
the last array from France in three

404
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,590
on when he succeeded

405
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,210
it will generate these interesting for
much but

406
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,710
180 defy simple so

407
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:19,950
the format to bite

408
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,430
I didn't read it with the house
underpinned experts were we have the

409
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,830
house

410
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,020
but we don't have the Pantech spies were
remember that we have the ability to get

411
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,950
the hassle from the plan and we have the
ability to be the bus were

412
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,020
password switzer system us we now have
they been to expose were

413
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,810
the real that a buzz-worthy of the kind
so at this point we thought that he was

414
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,470
pretty difficult to get something good
here

415
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,770
but the let's do some us again dust case

416
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,450
months and

417
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,370
for Megabus when you ready for the bus
were the house this is the crap

418
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,990
somehow how to make a bus will be united

419
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,340
me but that means there has the right to
with grated

420
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,410
is using the bus going clear: this and
that i won

421
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,460
and everyone is mediated using the house

422
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,910
and it doesn't last forever alone is
known to us

423
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:15,080
is that the is that value for us
possibly are there some way so we want

424
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,510
those entering for my son ray using this
form one

425
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,100
miss formula is a former have to use in
order to be there are 82

426
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,940
punching my result will be you know as
it was a good help these on either

427
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,760
so important that they do I have the
right one about why I think the way so

428
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,470
that i won

429
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,970
you have given it is gonna is rather
ever-present

430
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,150
the way that the beats will be rated the
gray area

431
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,560
is the I an area where they have its
will be erased so

432
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,780
is an important and then I heard that
the two until one thousand

433
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,780
3 I believe this is that they do but so
that

434
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,510
up there right so bisbee these bites
would be using it to play in a problem

435
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,640
because he's between I I want this entry
for

436
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,580
ira as a real is that the because

437
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,760
is not left the house day we only have
to take care of the spot

438
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,289
from okay and police party said

439
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:12,799
the solo tease love towers or got a
result

440
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,669
and gone to see I somewhat agree

441
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,679
this is the hardest and this is the
excess amount value

442
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,440
on the bus were tested if you saw I love
the constant between them

443
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,620
we get his number numbers is think so
the tree would be to get a buzz word

444
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,110
which says missing hot and also if
you're a bitch

445
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,370
characters between them we get the same
number good

446
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,409
as we have to store only been able
carter's on 20 27 and

447
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,789
we get 109 27 numbers

448
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:44,789
got it a so you only have two

449
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:45,880
brute force

450
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,520
the one hundred 100 these this is the

451
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,840
the bus were the we are going to create
so we'll have to

452
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,010
pick up okay because you're so I love
the cut it in then we got several 12

453
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,440
in this case in the case of dead will
have to take care of these numbers a

454
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,150
numbers thing this is they are going

455
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,870
that could make it possible you because
we didn't need us

456
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,919
for you okay a game

457
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,330
the explode 3 the prime in sweeping new

458
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,520
a game Miami then we just need to the
house which we got from split one

459
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,240
will be the bus were with says him past
and the same for multibyte

460
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,120
on a game will use ever disperse ever
tell person

461
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:35,120
see how it works

462
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,550
okay you have or binary super house by
nine

463
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,090
we'll will give to these binary the
house of the bus were

464
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,240
undefined there will give us all the 128

465
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
possible but worse now

466
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,130
hula playing a game

467
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,570
here

468
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,680
are using the bus were test which is
react well bus were asleep when

469
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,630
against approve click OK and

470
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,000
you have the country on a flight plan we
can keep

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,610
tools it's working that's ok so now

472
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,350
adding the clean again and now we will
use

473
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,400
our first bus tour from

474
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,940
hours split you

475
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,480
as we're could be the password please

476
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
here okay and knock you have to come to
power

477
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,860
but if we click to lose is not working
we have the same network error

478
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,260
so this bus were is selling the same
house but he's not certain that the same

479
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,240
for my two bites

480
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,230
as you body could be thinking right now
the worst case scenario here

481
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,310
is that we have to try it with 110 to
pursue a bachelor's

482
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,060
but the move don't worry about that
because the there because some

483
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,410
want to block you you tried with many
passengers

484
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,010
the peaceful decision upon so now

485
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,360
the will here with we know that there by
bus were in this case is

486
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:13,360
the number sixteen because we're

487
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,530
here

488
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,730
to prove now

489
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,860
here is the password okay now is getting
slower

490
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,130
screening for us you have the

491
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,160
conta bunny pana I'm finally forget
those is working

492
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,160
we can do a lot of stuff weekend they're
going to the clan

493
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,610
weekend do any and backup task over
start ask

494
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,460
we can copy any files of defy system

495
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,120
as you can see here we can connect to
the hard drive connect

496
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,400
and get any file and so on

497
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,400
so finger

498
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,220
so with this we don't have full access
to any remote client

499
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,320
anyone any sort we don't need

500
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,200
the main the mirror in Tina's we come
back up we're sorry the file

501
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,100
for example restoring and it'd except
David sounds good right we can execute

502
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,330
any except able after any backup restore
task a sec future of the application

503
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,790
so we can to promote call this a
gruesome because of this feature

504
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,040
underscores we tried with more
compressed password and test

505
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,080
we tried with the super secure passwords
you get here

506
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,490
and this is the house this POS were

507
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,190
on in this case there by the bus or will
be the first one

508
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,760
okay now we haven't thought about the

509
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,059
do this over other backup server is the
number to find a backup

510
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:56,510
it %ah a backup plan sobered by the use
bus home famous companies

511
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,940
such as CNN's Motorola breyer coming of
course

512
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,880
docs and

513
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,280
there on the put together by reducing
the spread at the scene

514
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,450
during our set so we decided to test it

515
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,740
Justin profession and then we found on
the 5th edition by bus

516
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,429
Anna crews permanent annual service

517
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:21,610
first we'll be there for the kitchen by
bus

518
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,880
and the first the like always will be.
understand the condition for the go

519
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,470
II's Jia the brassiere on

520
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,270
and where such house they sectors for
this but it also

521
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,410
with new for us and

522
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,740
so my earpiece always gonna be
everybody's going to

523
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,160
is great mayor in the 1991 Acer play so
I might be gone pretty

524
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,800
and is providing the way the team in
their celebrity so you can call

525
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,880
abrasions and he doesn't let you see
nobody looking up

526
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,700
it has many enemies you can see the gave
us we only

527
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,460
we have to publish the in this political
because he's the hip

528
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,780
that undercover use you know you've had
a

529
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,510
I'm hustlin site it is important things
services there Heather

530
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,260
I miss you decide these then has to be
named

531
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,610
the same name that you know that he

532
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:19,450
the we are proposing that the issue

533
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,210
because we love to break them to get him
with the government to get him back

534
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,059
attorney

535
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,919
it was realized that it was unclear at
this as you can see in the spring

536
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,910
okay at the next step will be

537
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,240
bus there from to get him back it in
this case you scenes will usually

538
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,200
framework

539
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,740
you have the to the template over there
education biker

540
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,190
you have different case a pirate on the

541
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,520
as you can see here we have here once
Acer okay

542
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,270
but when the winds here well the
geopolitical

543
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,980
in the soap work uses several chasers
for example

544
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,840
in the figures from packet use ssh to
for the user name

545
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,120
for the bus were and so on and as you
can see here we are only using one side

546
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,559
once a ser so we made a mistake

547
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,790
we found that while the vanity I mean if
you try to keep your

548
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,929
all the cases right you will find the
right their vanity as you can see here

549
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,050
we were fighting

550
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,929
and we were inspecting their requests
and responses in the canopy lover

551
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:22,080
and the responses from this everywhere
always 68 bytes

552
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,200
but as you can see here we have this
interesting man with two hundred and

553
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,889
eight bytes

554
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,690
and if we look at the packet we can see
that the user name on the bus were

555
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,109
are all zeros and we have a politician

556
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:37,379
within their backup server and

557
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,560
it's actually a position of the cell
number six

558
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,760
so a as you can see here Pfizer

559
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,619
are not only for grasses you have this
pretty self-explanatory

560
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:51,139
example but a the one maybe

561
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:54,590
her bleed you know about these course K

562
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,640
and undergarments with remind me know

563
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,930
we we using client in order leaders on
this great weather

564
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,400
and will have to change in at the to get
him back at the way I wanted to get to

565
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,160
my purse pocket

566
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,160
I'm let's see how it works up

567
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:31,150
it is that because you may pass pocket

568
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:35,089
missus then I was a funny look up and
we're going to

569
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,700
using gonna be there a no then dugan

570
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,519
in the all the on the rigors I'm on the
request to the server

571
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,160
interest and go to work

572
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,789
I'm willing to connect to their

573
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:58,829
tourism cabey's in the third

574
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:04,089
all the packets be seen as important
bucket going this is important but good

575
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,630
that contain under the cation

576
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,819
so we only have to change

577
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:12,269
aid by our indication my bus bucket

578
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:16,680
so copy and base it

579
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,240
they weren't looking

580
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,579
the half this is Ali says him

581
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,789
miss get your three we highly

582
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,849
to say whether the jury on a train to
them anymore these kinda buckets

583
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:37,009
on went to see how this works

584
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:41,450
after way to beat

585
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,450
they hear you you have for others to the

586
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,710
backup server well but first they were
good

587
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:55,710
but you can least Missy bathroom do so
many things

588
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,760
okay so you can do many things with his
banner ID

589
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,020
you gonna you have put up a stomach
ulcer do

590
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,030
to me but I'm supposed to apply and
resort operator plans

591
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,390
modify binaries it's a good common
after-tax as if you don't know because

592
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:17,750
you

593
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,450
as you can see music concert and finally
we

594
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,670
so solely to two million security
several guns that we've made for but the

595
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,240
display the article is the sea

596
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,040
just only approved because we have to
simulate earlier communication home

597
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,410
protocol and put him on the response and
its bit

598
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,410
have used us so we went to see aqui
demonstration

599
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,700
ABC's the proof

600
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,210
well and is accused eight-month first
we'll have to so sprite

601
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:10,210
it is old and as we wrote

602
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:17,790
get it done because you're my best
packet that we have to send

603
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:23,190
festival or their

604
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,599
on the request to respond I would have
to bar and Sen

605
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,369
final you contained

606

I still need to show you

610
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,990
willing to abandon the sea but some
proof

611
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,920
on

612
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,069
you look at that we have

613
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:05,099
the find this km

614
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,650
fight this municipal so we are listing
their these

615
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,910
this is a important thing okay this is
gonna be no

616
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,660
you can see all the requests are
responding apartments in

617
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,180
an important thing he said this bike at
the gate and

618
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,319
209 length remember that and get him a
bus back at

619
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:30,319
and that's on okay

620
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,369
next the vanity will be there
permanently of service

621
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:39,240
and the last one the using for the
fussing with on the set

622
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,260
volatility a.m. I find that name for
task patina

623
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,049
really big desk name in this case on
when the biggest interest to start it

624
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:47,940
always crisis

625
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,410
courses not an expert double-cross but
the only solution

626
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,660
and the only way to solve these easier
it's understanding the biggest

627
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,040
conditional their way so

628
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,400
could be you really and I am on

629
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,140
the last them social media of our last
exploit

630
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,109
a game with on the main meal we come
brute force the use a number count on

631
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:10,460
the dust number will see

632
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,490
that mister should be there was these
and we go half

633
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,089
these numbers and ask for their servers
and in idea but it without any

634
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:18,160
indication

635
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,510
adding new to see what's it was the
scene interview

636
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,980
I'm finally we just need to send them I
suspect

637
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:31,980
see how it works

638
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,730
you have the server we have to be stuck
a simple created a

639
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,020
some simple will use again

640
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,190
cannot be in this case will use and they
were kind of going to be notice in the

641
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,760
Bakken

642
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,810
ok you have the packet on

643
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,060
as you can see here we have the disc
then

644
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,450
dusk name which is really big without a
face thank you have the usual number

645
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,540
on you're in the right the the dusk
number

646
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,980
on this values has to be right okay

647
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,670
so I am we come brute force these values

648
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,750
okay or we can a.m.

649
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,150
send a idea but it was her with helping
if in addition to the sever will give us

650
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,300
all their you to numbers on the desk
numbers: so we can

651
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,430
do both things if you want

652
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,010
and then you will send the packet

653
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:31,010
within the work line

654
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,040
on here in this case the Severus
responding with an error

655
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,680
and that's when he goes the the user
number in this case

656
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,780
is not right so sane so now

657
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,110
we know that use a number is 18

658
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,890
meetings is a number

659
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm that we begun but forces are you
sure get these values

660
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,590
on this now there's a risk to respond in

661
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,320
with an OK and now they're because some
the graphic interface is trying to fit

662
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,400
the ask not name on it would press

663
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,250
and you try to open a game you know to
connect to the server it will press

664
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:14,600
Wilcrest Chris again and the only way to
solve the seasons and applications

665
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:21,600
could be fun as a conclusion

666
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,030
argument as ever plan

667
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,390
could be reused we found some about that
because someone is in April using this

668
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,340
Anthony

669
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,760
months and I'm the house with the father
by theme interesting you mean Sunday let

670
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,150
us

671
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,440
to buy more things than the so-called
amenities but changes hit worse

672
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,350
manage the Sonic progresses remember
honey backup for the issue my bus

673
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,550
the spam for us the minutes probably

674
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,820
you use so good diseases with them more
time

675
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,610
I'm really is a mod Liam Gallagher
service and they made us

676
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,090
promote cause the museum because it
houses

677
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,190
if you don't ambassadors to have more
security

678
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,390
because they are so pretty good palace
in our opinion

679
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,830
so thanks well I have been the moment
guys

680
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,600
things to him by his to my friend

681

and family and friends so the US team's

682
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:21,930
ago he

683
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:31,210
is there any question yeah

684
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,730
and it's not exploitable I will be worse

685
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,870
nine months ago against or 8

686
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,590
I'm not sure why if you wanna know white
snow mix but they will be gone

687
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,940
take it later but I don't bring her in

welcome thing

689
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,080
that's it yes with another

690
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:06,080
here

691
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:10,370
it appears that use on one issue their
ability to

692
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,560
be on security yet is it possible to
have an idea was a

693
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,280
amount of money move

694
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,900
I tell you later
