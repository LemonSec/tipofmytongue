1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,139
good morning everyone amor Paul Kagame

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:07,109
from the Alabama in the US work for

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,349
a aerospace company in the US called
dianetics

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,870
a a mayor network security architect

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,500
where I've specializes in building

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,880
designing securing a figure out how to
break into

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,699
telcos SCADA critical infrastructure
networks

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:30,160
or run around the world a doing
consulting in this area and speaking on

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
security issues in these domains and
when I get to share with you this

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,710
morning this summer world

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,809
stories that i've seen with critical
infrastructure

12
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:42,040
a how things are being broke into

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,440
in how we can possibly fix some other
stuff so over this talk

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
due to energy BPT in BBT is basically
the basic persistent threat

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,899
now after a develop this presentation I
gave it the first time I realize I

16
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:56,620
should have named

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,079
DPT per bid to persistent threat because
when the common threads will see that as

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,649
we go through this presentation

19
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,840
is a lot of the problems and I'm calm
and erbium

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,470
bill to these networks by the vendors
are

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,520
Ste things with default settings back
doors

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,659
the the bypass far roles BP and the

23
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,470
the enabling old-school attacks that we
should have been

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,189
passed a long time ago or enabling
adversaries to get into our critical

25
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,030
infrastructure

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,110
when I talk to critical infrastructure

27
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,470
the top 10 works that I see around the
world were public

28
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,479
the public network infrastructure
weather is the Toco or utility it's all

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,340
converging

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,750
your cable company your Toco your

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,700
you the utilities the power grid that's
all converging

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,159
into one network infrastructure the
cable the cable guys are given getting

33
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,990
into the power min some places

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,979
the telcos are getting into SCADA smart
grid

35
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,930
the utilities are getting into the
telephone cable IPTV business

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,439
in this is going to how local network
architecture the burbs at the very top

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,299
what you see

38
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:06,479
is the services we call always says
operational support systems

39
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,069
and in some cases it may be BSS business
support systems and that is where your

40
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,340
your main server headin operations or
were all the intelligence in the network

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,400
is we're gonna have your SCADA

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,580
you're going to have your network
management your provisioning

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,400
your automation up your billing system

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,450
back-office integration and more cured
by down into the network you have your

45
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,900
your core network infrastructure
transport network is we'll call it might

46
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,230
be

47
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,910
the dark fiber my my barber lit up with
the

48
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,580
sonet/sdh over your PBS pH a

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,290
MP last up possibly a transport by
William abuse and

50
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,599
and then you go down into the network
where you may be running passive optical

51
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,390
popper to the home active Ethernet all
the way out to

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,599
weird in case the summer the utilities
are running running out wherever they

53
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,379
have a meager

54
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,409
where they put out a new smart grid
meter they may be a

55
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:05,800
rolling out the services to in the you
have your legacy

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,830
is tht 1e1

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,400
at Fenway Park the world your and
technologies

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,920
but the common thread from the top to
bottom is the trust relationships you

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,980
have a trust relationship from top to
bottom between all the different systems

60
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,300
all these different components

61
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,930
are being installed by different vendors
into these /url

62
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,330
traditional critical infrastructure
networks in many cases the No were guys

63
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,569
that are running these networks like the
utility

64
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,860
is getting into the cable eyes P
business they don't know

65
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,989
happy very well or email how the telco
this getting into providing smart grid

66
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:40,760
services

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,280
to the utilities are really not educated
on skated

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,349
networks a in in so what happens is the
Bidder's going drop all this new complex

69
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,200
technologies and wherever it is in these
layers on a show

70
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,580
in they need in their gonna require
don't build into

71
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,120
there are 30 their proposals that
they're going to have remote access

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,470
because they understand when they when
they drop off the ryder truck with all

73
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,549
this new technology

74
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,269
the nowhere guys are not gonna how to
run it in they gotta keep their

75
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:07,319
customers that up

76
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,650
so they're gonna make sure they go back
doors in ways to get into these networks

77
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,510
to help manager

78
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,870
the problem is is there's not definition
in how these networks are going to be

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,470
managed by the remote

80
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,709
and I'm see that these networks have
been easily part

81
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,009
be a these a bagger connection Williams
real-world

82
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,800
examples so skated

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,530
the diagram on the around him as the ISA
99 standard for how he skated network

84
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,290
should be

85
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,330
architected could be and I see is now
working to doctor control system no word

86
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,340
about the in a

87
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,620
chemical plant manufacturing brought
typically deal with is in the utility

88
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,199
industry words skater

89
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,150
where we're managing the substations

90
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,540
possibly water super on in so the top
you have your enterprise network

91
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,440
were you with hope to have a firewall
the segments of the state a network with

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,600
the region years would be working

93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,320
it and as you go down in the network you
get further down into the layers were

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,370
there's actual

95
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,560
physics be controlled were on one side
there's an IP

96
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,280
or some legacy Protocol network that is
going to send signals to Mission

97
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,320
to a device that is going to make
something

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,280
in the physics domain happen turning
relays on of

99
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,110
it turn power off in a mixer all we
actually see in reality

100
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,050
is a bright spot where you see the far
wall between the enterprise network

101
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,860
in the skating at work in many cases
would use the real world

102
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,550
is it that's up the segmentation is
nothing more than a windows box

103
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,860
multi homes in in many really care row
cases

104
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,009
the segmentation if it has a firewall
the far wall has been

105
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:52,460
get so many holes punched in it is
basically act as a router

106
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,819
when you going to do an audit mister
looking at the big the eighth there's so

107
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,460
many ACLs that have been

108
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,030
conduits that have been opened up into
their firewall that it's basically just

109
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,410
like nothing more than a router

110
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,789
in a natural rule were in a row world
scenario up with an art

111
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,759
about the far wall we were so open
dubler leaking make this up permit any

112
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,620
any both in and out

113
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,259
in in the better put that inform that
was on the far wall to the business

114
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,530
network

115
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,130
that actually solve this in the

116
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,270
in they had what you will think with a
lot of the the stereotype we have in our

117
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,220
minds with skate in their words they had
a separate network for a skate

118
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,300
for the skating they were from the
business network

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,789
so the firewall for the business that
work was permitted in any both an

120
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:38,819
announcer

121
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,979
across all that I freaked out nyse: this
particular stated this

122
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,340
the utility was Wednesday does like show
me your stated network how do you get

123
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,940
into it

124
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,169
in faster than my eyes keep up with the
German what that is Android phone

125
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,020
Indian siege straight into a skater of
is a proponent never once did he put in

126
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,319
a password

127
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,340
another again better put that inform
because

128
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,250
in the in the girls love it because they
can you know they can be anywhere

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,520
and remotely manage the SCADA network
that

130
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,310
so superiors an exam who the real world
example were boys network

131
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,030
where these networks have been deployed
they'll get into the

132
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,130
rollouts I'll switch know in your
enterprise networks

133
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,389
you may have a by your you might have
the Cisco

134
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,479
unified miss CallManager system

135
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,130
I'm used to do used to deal with the
Cisco CallManager im my day some people

136
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,169
how the

137
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,240
the value but in the Toco world

138
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,319
what they call this is the class 5
switches the

139
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,770
Sol switch that is big enough to run
ball so happy for a large geographic

140
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,610
area sporty and hundreds of thousands of
people

141
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,979
it is mostly swimsuit observers other
due to the holiday would take you know

142
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,139
billable have a room the size a

143
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,849
you can consolidate him to but I have a
rack

144
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,819
in when they put that in what i've seen
in some cases

145
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,190
to insure remote access they're
basically

146
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,740
vendors again the vendors is common
thread the vendors were going to put in

147
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,509
a bag or connection

148
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,810
typically SSH it secures it is a safe
route

149
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,379
but but but the but the attack services
they open up is it 81 a coupon that this

150
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,419
is a service

151
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,660
is that they're do a brute-force
dictionary attack against

152
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,430
until they get a connection they don't
have it the trust relationship lockdown

153
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,789
to that all leader their whole network

154
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,919
the vendors the corporate network in BP
in

155
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,640
in connected than ever they have it
opened up so that anywhere in the world

156
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,310
anybody can find it can go

157
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,640
in attacked the road network management
system poll about passing the bar will

158
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,410
be PN

159
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,899
architecture that might be in place the
enable use the remote access

160
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,649
and what we've seen many times is these
networks are being bound as a

161
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:55,630
brute-force

162
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,420
in the only way that the critical
infrastructure vendors are finding out

163
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,399
is when they get notified by some banks
say in your

164
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,890
word there the real early their critical
infrastructure is being used to

165
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,360
to attacked by and then they get a Cease
desist letter

166
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,760
from a third party organizations I your
stuff has been used to hide me

167
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,350
stop it now

168
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,350
so online for the transport
infrastructure

169
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,459
would now wells got their school
learning networking both and

170
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,300
undergrad grad school and take a
certification courses I learned about

171
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,290
rains

172
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,160
in the killer telecommunications
industry before I got into becoming a

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,940
a Toco search provider engineer about
hurrying was the geographic green

174
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,370
there with you there with the physical

175
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,750
diversity in the SoCal ring topology
that they were selling that's what I was

176
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,940
led to believe

177
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,649
I got into the clout in actually started
working as a your search by the Engineer

178
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,029
now discovered there's a skunk concept
called a collapse backbone

179
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,190
show at the top words their way physical
geographic bring like a show at the

180
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,779
bottom

181
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,899
were you may have that works together
the different

182
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,250
cities image in a diverse top allergy

183
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,300
what they actually may do is Paul

184
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,519
a single fiber downside on a major
highway

185
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,550
were along the polls may be underground

186
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,690
in in in on both ends at the barber look
back out

187
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,820
in logic electronically creator reading

188
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,680
through one partner she's so with the
happy what happens with that is

189
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,870
in the US on a better we're in Europe
driver but once we're all

190
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,230
raccoon drunk driver back whole

191
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,390
I love you guys have tornadoes severe
bomb I'm from the south

192
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,079
in the US we have lotta tornadoes a one
tornado could walk out your network

193
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:47,630
connection

194
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,560
but you bouldering you bought a ring
topology

195
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,720
butter one connection and actually week
bus 01

196
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,250
X wanna to go search about her
experience worse in German decided they

197
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,070
were going to get into the copper
business

198
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,860
inclined the telephone poles and started
thinking you were going cut the copper

199
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,820
of the polls

200
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,050
in the cut met with the ended up cutting
was a barber

201
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,890
and knocked out communications between
two CDs to

202
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,519
years example had a the telco

203
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,050
got into the business providing IPTV

204
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:28,250
Voice over IP a cable TV or crappy were
your TV channels arm out to IP multicast

205
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,910
addresses so you're changing multicast
address their time you get the clicker

206
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,829
on your TV and they also got into the
business of providing smart grid

207
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,690
services

208
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,310
to utilities and the road is India's
security assessment to

209
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,320
to test the past year the network will
be discovered

210
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,180
in this case is the bender for the
billing system put in a firewall form

211
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,110
great you put in the far wall but we
also discovered in 10 test

212
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,380
is that the vendor did not put any kind
external DMZ architecture in this

213
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,620
critical infrastructure network where
they're providing numerous services

214
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,690
to this community up so that

215
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,010
the architecture was that the internal
billing system and the inter

216
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,399
external billing system are all sitting
on one server

217
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,040
so all you have to do in there will be
discovered in our print as is the

218
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,170
Papa J Paul Scheele get a show on the
server room from the

219
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,300
be able to spread influence

220
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,100
across the network mccall's the there
was no segmentation

221
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,019
in there's a there's an inherent trust
relationship from the billing system

222
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,149
to the infrastructure up in the upper
right hand corner where you have

223
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,850
automatic provisioning

224
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,430
and where the network can be from from
the billing system all the way down to

225
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,380
the customer

226
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,110
in point about us automated provisioning
where the you were you paid your bill

227
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,350
your service they zone you don't pay
your bill your servers automatically

228
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,200
turned off there's no truck roll

229
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,630
a if you need more fuel new services
that could be on Mac revision

230
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,139
where's the trust relationship between
their billing system in that network

231
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:00,470
infrastructure

232
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,230
that could be easily exploited once the
initial hand-hold was grabbed

233
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,230
and when we ended up having lots of
screenshots

234
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,389
show in jails how we were able to do
this we start because the rules of

235
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,170
engagement

236
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,940
didn't get to go as far as we wanted to
are like this all out in the

237
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,740
in the vendor who put in the billing
system they won the argument this

238
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,180
architecture get to stay in place in

239
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,490
went on to secure your systems anymore
when the government thing I learned

240
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,029
there is a security person as a

241
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:31,269
technical got is who got

242
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,769
is whoever is involved with the
financials that can talk the language is

243
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,019
the CEO and the CEO's

244
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,779
which is numbers the goal when the art
me no matter how strong the technical

245
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,110
argument is in many cases

246
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,300
is these guys helped the they did the
billing system

247
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,380
they controlled I'll bills get paid and
hell revenue is a

248
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,209
dealt with so they had greater influence
at the table

249
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,230
drills and in the billing system vendor
now is in the

250
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,990
security businesses that make you feel
any better I hope nobody's reason

251
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:08,449
again BPT been a persistent threat they
paid for this

252
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,810
so here's a an example the transport
network

253
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,920
where you have the boys video internet
smart grid

254
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,130
a all the telecommunications services
you can imagine SCADA everything runs

255
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,310
across is

256
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,370
a manage in as smart meters

257
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,110
where where there's meters deployed all
runs across is the

258
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,279
infrastructure in the center there we
have a transport network where we're

259
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,649
aggregating barber maybe multiplexing
the

260
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,430
lot frequent seems out the lambdas

261
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,100
to run different services all across
this core network it was keyed in

262
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,970
know with this core transport network is
this particular vendor that was put in

263
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,230
they implemented some technology in
there a6 because they knew that the

264
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,329
their customers are implementing IPTV
withered

265
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,550
like a submission earlier were there
multicast in

266
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,610
cable TV channels over IP

267
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,820
they built into their a6 so that

268
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,709
the the multicast the IGMP handshake
that happens typically a layer 2

269
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,970
a instead it that having to go through
the normal RC process

270
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,480
they just did it in a six so that all
Michael happens any

271
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,550
any traffic gets put into this
particular the lawn on this transport

272
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,300
backbone

273
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,990
what automatically be replicated in 86

274
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,570
as really good because I gave really
good past performance

275
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,899
in response time with your customer
you're changing your makin

276
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,839
changing channels at home you get a
really quick response really Chris

277
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,889
TV channel change in response problem
was

278
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,970
because they broke authorities into that
in hardware

279
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,980
a you know there's no internal brett
Rockman to insiders may know we have no

280
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,850
issues

281
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,180
up in this case it was an accident

282
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,630
the the supervisor accidentally
provisioned

283
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,790
Internet traffic over into this deal and
in the core transport network

284
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,070
for cable TV at PB diem and as a result

285
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,579
when they provisioned a large segment at
Internet traffic Internet subscribers

286
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,470
that are impacted you know with all the
internet botulism a botnet malware

287
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,500
traffic

288
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,740
put that over into that video be late
the hardware automatically start

289
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,360
replicating that

290
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,750
in the network rolled over and when I
talk about rolled over all the services

291
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,800
over here on the left hand side

292
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,089
your smart meter SCADA boris be a winner

293
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,699
all their oh there were no core
transport no services

294
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:35,190
we start looking likely in this case
they they made a good investment in

295
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,279
secure visualization and instrumentation
so that they had visibility on the

296
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,120
problems

297
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,370
ways we were able to I was actually on
the highway

298
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,660
had to pull over to the side road in das
ich packets over the phone

299
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,810
in there they were explained to me up we
figured out what had happen is there was

300
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,870
towards the end all this

301
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,310
the knowledge service to traffic up
encapsulated in a GMP

302
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,440
there was some crazy stuff ICMP down
service track

303
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,089
inside the Nigerian people like it was
really weird

304
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,429
but keep keep the takeaway is a

305
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,110
with this network infrastructure if
you're involved in this domain you got a

306
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,780
house and tools in place so that you can
do for peak

307
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,230
not only going into NetFlow see who's
talking to who when the session started

308
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,449
in a and how much how much is too much
traffic is flowing between

309
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,780
the buses but they would do a poopy
kappa B would do it

310
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,299
in large quantities a you know it ten

311
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,690
10 gave her more so you can troubleshoot
something I guess

312
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,480
so hers problem I'll

313
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,179
the that have we sold a couple years ago
they just recently happened in Brazil to

314
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,770
like four million modems

315
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,179
in you a key porn here is a

316
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,250
both the networks at us all in the in
the network in Brazil the the telco they

317
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,240
got hacked

318
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,750
we see this and we see this around the
world is a lack of attention to

319
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,190
separation know the control plane the
data plane in the management plan

320
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,130
services

321
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,340
control plane being the network
protocols your router protocols

322
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,130
so you're always Pierre period europea
your BGP having that lockdown

323
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,760
up in the measure playing held the
devices are managed having that lockdown

324
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,299
is secured

325
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,679
and then your data plane in in this case

326
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
the the core infrastructure this network
was locked down

327
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,020
but the DDS il broadband

328
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,080
network devices the CPE that the telcos
are putting out

329
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,600
at the UN points was not secured will be
what happened when we first discovered

330
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,010
this hike is we had two telcos a gated

331
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,850
want okolo the they discovered it its
600 routers they're able to stop because

332
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,250
they had tools in place

333
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,380
to detect it that a someone in another
part of the world

334
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,090
started running tools to I called the

335
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,390
the DSL routers they knew about a back
door

336
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,130
username/password you start getting
these routers and change in the DNS

337
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,820
settings so when a user plugged in they
booted up

338
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,870
and they got the DHCP the

339
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,030
DNS it they got would pull redirect them
to I

340
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,220
a rogue DNS server somewhere out in the
Internet

341
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,890
2011 telcos able to stop it is 600 the
other women

342
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,539
about 6,000 routers before they started
in this really the same attack happened

343
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,510
over Brazil

344
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,860
is like over four million dollars before
they got to stop

345
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,080
and all had to happen is the management
plane been secured

346
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,080
so that no one there was an authorized
could

347
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,080
touch the DSL CPE

348
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,490
along the lines with the control play
match point airplane a

349
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,750
separation a service here's another
example

350
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,780
had it had a telco they needed to bring
the a temporary

351
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,770
ATM circuit Bolivar not some people's do
we still have to use ATM ever known any

352
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,650
diff to me think today teams did

353
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,140
popped its head back up so weird bring
up a a a to know to an ATM circuit

354
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,539
temporarily to get over a pan with
crunch

355
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:05,440
until some new fiber could get
provisions

356
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,470
and we so would would end up happening
is the

357
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,470
Toco poured out an old router that had
been mothballed

358
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,730
had running ode kod in

359
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,260
didn't realize but in the access network

360
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,740
they had not been they had not secured
the control plane

361
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,340
at the access network to stop Internet
subscribers

362
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,850
from being able to in Iraq with control
plane protocols whenever protocols and

363
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,240
what I mean by that

364
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,830
is they had they had this this whole
legacy rather put in place

365
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,659
as a temporary stopgap in one other in
an obsessed Rob started trying to

366
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:42,220
initiate

367
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,730
BGP connections with their core network
infrastructure while the world with

368
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,500
someone

369
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,390
internet subscriber on a low bandwith
connection be trying to

370
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,280
initiate BGP connections with your core
BGP router should never been

371
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,659
should have been stopped cold at the
access layer but

372
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,330
but they started they danced somebody
found interested in

373
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,809
stories in in malformed BGP Packers and

374
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,220
rolled over their router could have been
so blessed stopped with

375
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,409
control plane protocol security

376
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,080
so here's a this is when I first got
really a bar where over

377
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,659
the bender persistent threat issue love
these cable TV

378
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:27,500
TV networks are being put in the new
IPTV Arians in the

379
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,419
the utility world the call the data
center where the cable TV

380
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,760
world they call the data center ahead in
yeah and it's all about Martin who

381
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,490
you're talking to you

382
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,559
your problems the other called the
central office within the hour in the

383
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,220
cable TV world the call the head in

384
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:48,190
so in this headin you have analog
digital converters you have middleware

385
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,230
I to talk to the analog digital cable TV
devices and integrate with your billing

386
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,080
system

387
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,870
as a whole lotta integration it's
happening lots a different vendors

388
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,820
providing different parts to the
solution

389
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,909
to provide these new services

390
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:05,340
in this particular case I was a working
news network infrastructure work one day

391
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,730
and wanted the hinder showed up I don't
know we're

392
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,039
unannounced on planned with the new
server

393
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,320
a free unannounced upgrade have any time
in terms there's a better show up with

394
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,970
the new free upgrade for you

395
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,179
including hardware so gonna look curious
that they've they showed up the role in

396
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:25,010
this new hardware while I was there

397
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,169
and the customer you there these guys
are used to

398
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:32,059
you know this drop a bucket truck know
before they got into the cable TV

399
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,220
business the revenue producing power

400
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,960
troubleshooting the problems with
electric grid so I'll

401
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,760
been been a custom rather custer digging
into the problem when I discovered

402
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,190
is that the bender had gotten hacked in
through the

403
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,780
in when the vendor got hacked at their
headquarters network they had a trust

404
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,590
relationship

405
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,610
into the cable TV Hindi and

406
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,270
in the adversary pitted of their network

407
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,470
into the utility network impact

408
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,159
hacked the server at that my customer's
network that reason they showed up with

409
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:03,630
the

410
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,570
free upgrade in so that got me

411
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,120
they got me thinking

412
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,340
with all these different vendors the
integrated together

413
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,659
and how these open trust relationships
in these heady ins

414
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:22,090
central offices data center on

415
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,710
what what is the likelihood there have
been targets pop

416
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,980
the pit of love in

417
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,470
in they going to say another one other
customer networks

418
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,460
in the adversary is able to pivot all in
export the trust relationships that are

419
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,400
inherently

420
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,169
existing go back and other internet
works in just stole it is daisy chain

421
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:45,840
impart numerous customers numerous
vendors by way of these trust

422
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
relationships that exist

423
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,740
because the because when you get into
these networks their flat

424
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,909
there's no there's no segmentation the

425
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,820
the main number plant layer 2 no words
there's no private the lands there's no

426
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,130
deal and ACLs

427
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,830
if they're routed they're not do in a
sealed between the routed the lands

428
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,260
mean if you get in you have access

429
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,809
this goes back to beads upon wondered
about the target act we're

430
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,610
the h-back bender got hacked in
Antarctica hi it

431
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,190
if target was led the rage back better
come in remotely the question in my mind

432
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,520
have any other vendors came into that
network and

433
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,169
and was possibly their hairpin turns
happening were

434
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:31,539
they're able to shoot back and other
vendor network I don't know

435
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:37,429
wonder about these things so here's
another the work scenario

436
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:41,169
transport no the the telco put in a new
transport network

437
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:47,020
were there running numerous services
across their core backbone

438
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,830
and the vendor put in a Linux box multi
homes

439
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,549
Poli bypass the Faroe infrastructure in
this case the been the

440
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:58,919
telco had a very very large investment
and firewall VPN

441
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,820
idea security the politics being what
they were

442
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,350
the the transport network organ part of
the organization

443
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,789
was able to get their network installed

444
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:14,820
so that their vendor could bypass the
security infrastructure is in place

445
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,760
there wasn't a corporate policy driven
down about how banners were don't come

446
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
into the network

447
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,799
be managed so they're able to bypass the
firewall with their multi home Linux box

448
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,000
with a wide open SSH

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,020
service so that anybody could find it
brute force it and they did

450
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:34,900
and they hacked it no account lockout
any these cases by the way

451
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,490
and the hackers got into the network and
were able to control the whole transport

452
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:39,970
network

453
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,950
likely for the telco they didn't know
what they had gotten into but they got

454
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,120
into the system the critical services

455
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,120
war the whole region because it was the
core transport network wasn't the access

456
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,120
was in a particular service he was the
core backbone network management system

457
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,610
everything had was dependent on that
power the network

458
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,179
but by the thankfully some the the

459
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,940
smut a bank in Europe note about him
with that attack it happens

460
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,520
then we got brought in to help mitigate

461
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,130
so recommendations

462
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,539
the from the goggles on bills total no
words and figures out how to break into

463
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:24,289
your some recommendations I'll typically

464
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:28,289
through the networks are managed in band
workers want physical network in there's

465
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,710
multiple services run across as the
physical network including the

466
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,010
management plan

467
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,029
I a highly encourage you to to

468
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,120
going take there was a model in

469
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,570
and work your way from top to bottom a
blocking down the control plane match

470
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,650
plane and data plan

471
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,020
everywhere there was a model make sure
they were all the different services are

472
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,230
locked down and secure

473
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,659
in leverage in a few if you're using one
of these new hire in the works

474
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,900
especially during the critical
infrastructure world you should help the

475
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,679
serbs the software services and support
this

476
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,320
use the burt around borden instances
they were you lies in MPLS multiprotocol

477
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,750
label switching

478
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,880
so that you can carve up your routing
table so the

479
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,440
normally in your been your routing table
you have the one global routing table

480
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,870
but when you start liking

481
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,390
advantage %uh burgers in MPLS you can
logically

482
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,020
carve up your IP routing table so that
there's a routing table for all the

483
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,700
different services that you define

484
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,700
in what I would I prefer but i wanna see
is that the management network is in its

485
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,549
own birth

486
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:32,000
its only in pillows BPN so that if
someone

487
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,990
gets into the data network been to the
data plane

488
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,600
they're not able to PID in get over into
the management network and help direct

489
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,230
influence

490
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,990
all over you your your network
infrastructure by the way about the

491
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,770
management like

492
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,559
because when I comment if you're
organization hires me to commit to test

493
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,080
turnover

494
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,260
on corner this management network I
don't care what I'll

495
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,899
some how much money you spent on
security if I can get in if I can find a

496
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,179
way that touch that management plane

497
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,270
everything is lost and at the same time

498
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,350
in that in pillows the the birth

499
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,370
for your management network I'd
encourage you to have a separate non

500
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,289
attributable

501
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,590
BP in just for remote access to the

502
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,140
the imputed to the management network so
that no one is able to go

503
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,880
and directly target that a from from the
internet

504
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
have that holy isolated I'm very
paranoid about the management no word

505
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,250
mean secure important for the LogMeIn
your static has are

506
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,529
star passwords are toast the work was we
gotta go two factor authentication for

507
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:34,090
these networks for the number two buses

508
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,500
and for all the network management
servers if I trust relationship can be

509
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,700
exploited

510
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,039
it's all over with

511
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:45,299
if you have a budget mean especially
with these critical infrastructure

512
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,080
networks

513
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,539
it is around in there to go in and put
in a secure

514
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,570
mmm managed infrastructure

515
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,200
mean we spend all this money on all the
critical infrastructure and we neglect

516
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,500
the management operational

517
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,090
well I'd like to see is a at a band
there were put in place

518
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,789
that is dedicated for managing this
network infrastructure

519
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:08,850
so that if in again use a non
attributable

520
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,039
remote remote access with two factor
authentication in monitor

521
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,500
everything your the routers in the
servers

522
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,730
switches that are deployed today they
all have an Arab and network connection

523
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,620
available why not use it in build out to
an out-of-band networking structure and

524
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,730
haven't always secure

525
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,399
so that if necessary breaks and the
Papas were some advanced malware

526
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,799
they came the flip it over into the
network management infrastructure and

527
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,460
take over

528
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,809
complete control influence over the
network criticism

529
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,220
this is where I see the the answers are
really skilled are going for everybody's

530
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,880
looking at the end point devices

531
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,399
and while our bodies chasen the
important problem they have a surge

532
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,950
divided into the network infrastructure
is life in

533
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,620
the whole time in soon as you going to
clean up soon as you going to clean up

534
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,669
the appoint a buzz is the right back in

535
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:59,299
because they're probably inside the
network infrastructure

536
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,520
the in these critical infrastructure
networks with other

537
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,039
the telcos the SCADA and smart grid he
said ur

538
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:10,120
nothing is prevailing there's got to be
stopped we put in all those new network

539
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,870
infrastructure withers juniper Cisco
pick your

540
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,020
you're a Kool Aid a for new managed
network device

541
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,539
the layer to problems old school where
two problems are prevailing we should

542
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,600
have been passed this years ago

543
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
that it shouldn't be that someone can
get physical access or the network a

544
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,380
star running old school stuff like or
poison

545
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,850
I hate to say this but if somebody can
get physical access they can on the

546
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,140
network Breezewood

547
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,549
but only today 0 they don't need any APT
all the

548
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,049
all they all they do is pull something
cheesy like Cain and Abel and I can

549
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,750
start poppin pop in the network and then
you have the

550
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,600
per stop redundancy protocols were you
may have a router running in parallel

551
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,850
redundant so the one router

552
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,029
fails another one picks up automatically
in another run in the BRP

553
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:00,320
a because the anything but Cisco shop
where you may be running

554
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,890
HSRP because it is a Cisco shop I'll

555
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,559
where we see those if not indication is
there it's clear text

556
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,940
even though im b5 is an option the

557
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,870
there's typically no authentication in
denver is a dedication the password is a

558
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,190
if you get access where you can explore
it you can see it in your packet sniffer

559
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,350
that the password is typically Cisco
that we did in class

560
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,980
just in a pass on wire so that you can
go into mandible tax against the first

561
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,450
opera

562
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,440
redundancy protocol the stuff needs to
be cleaned up in one was there this is

563
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,570
prevailing also in the enterprise
networks

564
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,470
and how are recommended to attack this

565
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,940
so that everyone can say face on the
network team is maybe gonna take it as

566
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,299
the

567
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:46,529
be well the problem you something like
Cisco identity services engine

568
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,440
where you can start with the wireless
network and work your way and

569
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,669
Inc to work your way into the physical

570
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,840
they're working to your router your
switches

571
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,190
and and clean up the port security on
these networks and clean this mess up

572
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,500
because it is prevailing never were

573
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,700
bomb on recommendation is there by some
other

574
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,149
up while listening applications the 1i
go while this the network traffic

575
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:15,640
was like this figure out what the trust
relationship should be on our network we

576
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,740
should talk to

577
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,350
when where how much we listless lockdown
those fresh relationship to the servers

578
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,159
in the network peripherals walk down
that management plane

579
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,970
anything it tries the Bali that trust
relationship

580
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,320
the should is what we should be
monitoring his Berber overwhelmed with

581
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,720
all the noise in our logs

582
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,929
if you're trying to do really good
logging in many cases

583
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:43,380
people's they put the infrastructure in
place for compliance for audits

584
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,820
and then they don't pay much attention
to it after it's been in place was are

585
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,049
overwhelmed with all the noise

586
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,640
well as if we just one in whitelisted
what should be happening

587
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,220
home I between RP Sports & services and
had a while listening when then monitor

588
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,399
the book violates that trust
relationship we will cage

589
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:07,370
a lot of the problems that are happening
in the networks

590
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:14,370
as information I had to share with you
today is ur any questions

591
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,049
in

592
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:33,120
up

593
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,480
in management probably is also

594
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,059
are running on all prior proprietary
cards and

595
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,549
small do next stack from about 10 years
ago

596
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:48,039
butter letter or don't pass this age
services

597
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,809
probably running in the mood the

598
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:54,730
slurs 2.6 was was a mod Oracle

599
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,980
with all the deal with all the defaults
yeah that's a

600
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,320
the you know what I'm talking about
using any more questions

601
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:10,320
anyone but Jason you the group

602
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,970
a layer axis layers transfer layers
because the application

603
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:23,530
what are your views on the new threats
coming with Sdn

604
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,339
what's over the final working I'm not

605
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:31,649
the work with Sdn as a vietnam very
interested in what's going to do

606
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,119
develop in that domain I have been

607
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,069
worked with an SD in their work yet i'm
reading about it study but I

608
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:43,190
done to my customers rolled out SD in
yet the it's all there waiting to see

609
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,280
what's going to happen

610
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,460
do didn't buy my customers are trying to
figure out whether they're gonna go into

611
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,980
like the Cisco ACR they're going to

612
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:57,339
go with the open source route open in
the future baby come back brief on that

613
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:00,150
I'm very interested in how that's all
going to work in

614
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,329
what that's going to bring into play
when I expect to see will usually with

615
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,890
unions be put out at the

616
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,470
edge other network at the access layer
where there's a lot of the

617
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:16,030
synergy to be those look at bill these
problems to be solved with east-west

618
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,190
traffic in the telco

619
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,280
networks access layer so will be in
Reston

620
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,680
I but I have no personal experience with
respect to Jason

621
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Jason to bring this up but

622
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,109
wins worker said that you're talking
about solar flares I did not hear solar

623
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:40,940
flares in their presentation into

624
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,859
what is your comment on the possibility
is over where's infecting the

625
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:48,089
the network uncertain how that would be
a bad thing because

626
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:52,280
I was promised solar flares I

627
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,329
I I take no responsibility for anything
the win said before I got up

628
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:01,770
a I know nothing about solar flares
therefore to learn term wins

629
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,060
presentations are but it may be late

630
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,430
maybe next time I'll have a presidential
solar flare effect on their words

631
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:14,859
anyone else upper Churchill that may
come speak to date

632
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:15,109
thank you
