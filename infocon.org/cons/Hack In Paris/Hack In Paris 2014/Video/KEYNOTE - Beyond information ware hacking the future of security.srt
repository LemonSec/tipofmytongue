00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,120
its snowden the MSA and all other global
players is the what is going on

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,390
and we have some incredible people that

with some other panelists that are up
here and we've got somebody who's gonna

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,140

keynote including all the administrative
Europe

53
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,390
and order to talk about little bit about
information warfare

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,760
and the future and how this community

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,870
has some real obligations to participate

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,069
maybe in some new ways that we haven't
quite

57
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,290
been doing enough love and then a
challenge you

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,870
to get may be involved in more areas
that you currently are

59
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,870
no I grew up in the old days

60
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,310
long time ago that was my first Def Con

61
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,980
and my first beer apparently as well

62
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,090
but I i grew up in analog

63
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,939
engineer anybody know what I am loggers
of four people in the room

64
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,760
I grew up in analog engineer we didn't
have bits and bytes

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,439
and the first computer I bill was
actually in analog computer

66
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,760
that my mother and father bought me for
seven dollars

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,039
and its sort of works

68
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,380
but I started teaching me a great deal
about

69
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,600
engineering at a very very young age in
a turns out

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,590
the I did not know this until many years
later

71
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,789
everybody knows who Richard Stallman is

72
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,130
right he was my neighbor

73
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,210
I grew up with the kid didn't even think
about it for years

74
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,169
and he taught me how to use transistors
and make amplifiers and radios

75
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,600
when we were seven years old so I grew
up in a very very different world we

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,150
didn't have kids we had to build

77
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,759
everything on our own when the type
packing we did back then

78
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,150
is similar more to what some love the d
I Y

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,900
do it yourself ers are doing where the
parts don't yet exist

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,490
so over the years I was involved in the
audio and video industry television and

81
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,750
movies

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,569
and it was all analog nope it's

83
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:15,590
no bites every time we tried to make
automation work

84
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,009
it fails and we had to quote unquote

85
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,449
hack systems together manually do things

86
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,580
to make them work and in many cases
that's what we're going through today

87
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,030
with some technologies and this is where
some other challenges gonna come from

88
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,360
but first I wanna go back a little bit I
got involved in security

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,860
in 1983 so on power although at all

90
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,940
stuff and during the eighties

91
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,360
we were all kinda learning one is this

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,490
security stuff what does that mean

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,550
does it really even matter

94
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,270
so what number of us got together over
the years in the eighties

95
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,639
and started making some predictions
about where things were going to go when

96
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,000
I wrote this book

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,680
to start talking about some crazy ideas

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,250
that people did not believe people did
not believe

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,419
that we had anything to worry about for
those of you who may know

100
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,500
Al Gore the former vice president of the
united states

101
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,800
he said we should give the Internet
everybody

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,389
security and privacy will not

103
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,410
be a problem and that was in nineteen
ninety

104
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,949
and many of us had a big problem with
that

105
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,050
because he was saying it's great and
it's perfect and

106
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,800
don't worry about it your government is
here to help you

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,300
so we've got the deal with congress and
lots of us were testifying in talking to

108
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,449
them about the future

109
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,669
that we saw and we saw yes

110
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:59,000
you know it's going to be great and
we're gonna have a lot of fun but

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,319
there's gonna be some problems and
summer those problems are what we're

112
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,009
seeing today

113
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:08,560
are malware nobody believes that now
where

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,210
was gonna be a problem now the internet
will take care two minutes its it's all

115
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,000
fixable

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,330
don't worry about it because darpa US
government to the original designs

117
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,349
no worries are the concept %uh chipping
back in the nineteen eighties

118
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:28,770
we talked about building malware into
silicon

119
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,169
but they said we were crazy it'll never
happen

120
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:40,099
hasn't happened yet anybody go to China
often with them bring back silicon

121
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,300
we're seeing the silicon chip in going
on

122
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,479
and with ending up finely US government
cares

123
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,879
to the deming up in our military systems
so suddenly that the weapons won't work

124
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,990
now we care about it

125
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,900
are we'll talk a little bit about her
high-energy radio frequencies

126
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,889
and some other ramifications about we
talked about backup

127
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:06,310
what I called cyber civil disobedience
using the Internet for politics

128
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,509
Congress said to me why would they ever
do that

129
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,210
the congresspeople actually served a
search warrant out

130
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,680
why with the bad guys ever want to use
the Internet

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,759
that was the what we were fighting and
some love you

132
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,479
remember this that we're trying to talk
about things that were

133
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,479
on popular are we talked about

134
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,960
denial of service attacks and they tried
to convince us

135
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,970
the Internet was designed to be
resilient

136
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,040
it will protect itself that's how it was
designed

137
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,330
how's that all going for us these days
and then there were the political issues

138
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,010
as well but we were trying to raise

139
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,900
very very unpopular the economy is a
national security s

140
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,220
asset we talked about critical
infrastructures back in the eighties

141
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,540
nobody cared nobody cared you can be
hearing some interesting things

142
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,010
throughout the summer

143
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,420
our convention on that as well a
vigilante is on this concept the strike

144
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,030
backs

145
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,010
we're arguing the corporations and
private individuals will have

146
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,190
similar technological power

147
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,030
but governments do know you're crazy
it's never going to happen

148
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,500
what's the world we live in today will
the world we live in today there's a lot

149
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,970
of convergence and

150
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,780
one of the things I I've been pushing
the concept though for many years

151
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,070
is security is not only about your bits
and bytes

152
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,300
at is only a small part of it what is
the single biggest problem we have in

153
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,120
security

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,030
and it's a dirty four-letter word what
is it

155
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,960
user that's it user the dirty
four-letter word when it comes to

156
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,200
security

157
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,530
and one other things that we have
ignored many view went through

158
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,760
we try to think about how we're in the
cyber world well

159
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,790
yet we r but how much

160
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,670
up the internet is cyber versus physical
and when we consider how much

161
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,470
the I was copper its fiber its servers

162
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,080
the Internet is physical yet we've been
treating it

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,650
all too often as a purely digital cyber

164
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,930
about environment there's another
component to it

165
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,350
which is the physical and then obviously
the people component

166
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,640
summit you may get involved with the
dirty four-letter word users

167
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,280
we all have the problems with our users
whether it's at home

168
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,710
are parents

169
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,140
or executives are those executives doing
it work for you when it says

170
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,680
all security applies to everybody but me

171
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,540
anybody see that of course so the people
component the cyber to vote on the

172
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,480
physical component require

173
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,450
moreover combination to be effective

174
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,340
and I'm into challenger to think about
some other things that we need to look

175
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,470
at for the future

176
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,450
under the promise that if we as the
community

177
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,070
don't really get more pro actively
involved

178
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,550
in hacking future technologies matthau

179
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,400
we will continue to lose we have
opportunity the skill sets in this room

180
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,370
and in the community worldwide

181
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,040
are tremendous now I'm not saying don't
worry about JavaScript I'm not saying

182
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,270
don't worry about SQL injections

183
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,420
but in many ways I could argue that
that's

184
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,590
aid stuff okay let's just grind it out

185
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,540
do the research but I want to take a
look at what's gonna happen 510

186
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,180
and twenty years from now and start
preparing

187
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,350
for what's gonna happen because we've
already

188
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,100
lived through government saying it'll
never happen

189
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,780
don't worry about it so some other
things we have to keep in mind

190
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,290
is that technology has always always

191
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,670
been weaponized with always found a way

192
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,500
to take any technology and turn it into
a killing machine:

193
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,070
or make it part of the military now the
internet we talked about this

194
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,250
back in the eighties how we're going to
weaponize it and again we were crazy

195
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,270
we were on our minds that was never ever
gonna happen

196
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,000
the concept of cyberterrorism the
concept that cyber war

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,780
with you like the words or not we have
nation-states we have terrorist

198
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,050
organizations

199
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,700
using the same technologies for their
purposes

200
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,070
would it be different today

201
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,120
if twenty-five years ago somebody have
listened

202
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
what would be the difference I don't
know the answer to that

203
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,150
but I do know that somehow it would be
different

204
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,290
would be better technologically would we
have accelerated TCPIP into a more

205
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,870
secure protocol

206
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,050
what would we have done I don't know but
I do know that we

207
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,210
ignored the problem

208
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,030
loss the reason we're in the mess we're
in today

209
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,440
even the new technologies that have come
out since the nineteen seventies

210
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,890
these are the same technologies that we
use that we wanna

211
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,560
used for privacy the bad guys use for
anonymity

212
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,500
and this was an argument back with PGP
fills a room in Indy

213
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,880
early days of the late 80's early 1990s

214
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,250
same thing with scaleable computing and
massive

215
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:50,330
a massive Bob MPP work we have
distributed processing

216
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,480
what kind of power does that mean

217
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,750
the bad guys have got so

218
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,570
have to keep in mind that this is all
about life cycles

219
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,440
and this is another an award function
it's a curve

220
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,610
right now see if this will work we've
got some stuff and we're we're kinda

221
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,180
fairly mature

222
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,610
in an awful lot of the technologies that
we have deployed today

223
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,840
when we were talking about security
problems in the eighties

224
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,900
we were more down in this part of the
world

225
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,650
but don't worry about security

226
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,890
it doesn't matter everything will be
fine so

227
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,940
I'm gonna argue and I asked you

228
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,660
to get involved with all these new
technologies down at this point

229
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,680
start hacking them early hacked them
hard

230
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,090
before we start seeing

231
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,260
the growth in the curves that we have in
the past

232
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,420
anybody ever been on the phone with the
computer and had a long conversation

233
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,320
with it before you realize that was a
computer

234
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,480
in the US this is happening all the time
you call up Dell

235
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,900
you call up Verizon phone company

236
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,170
and you have start having a conversation
and at some point

237
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,280
something clicks inside your head

238
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,700
this is wrong something's not quite
right

239
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,310
and then you ask the question are you a
human

240
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:27,150
so now the chatbox your program of
course sir I am a human

241
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,480
can you pass the Turing test

242
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,890
so having conversations with computers
and trying to imply be

243
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,210
Turing test and now that the Turing test
has but pass some time in the last few

244
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,690
weeks

245
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,400
we're gonna see increasing levels of
chat box not just for sex and porn and

246
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,960
phone calls

247
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,550
but it's gonna go far beyond that and
right now I'm getting at home

248
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,840
some number phone calls every day into
my office

249
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,000
from computers that are exceedingly well
done

250
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,030
that it is almost impossible to tell
initially

251
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,480
whether it is a computer I'm having a
conversation with

252
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,250
or is it a real human so there's a
certain concept of

253
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,820
social engineering the computer that is
calling you

254
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,130
how can we abuse this earlier be four it

255
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,480
the chatbox the technology the people
that are promoting all this

256
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,880
find ways to bypass all of the mental

257
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,200
capacities of the average user

258
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,220
these are the people that we need to
protect we now have a

259
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,240
mess with these things we know how to
challenge the technology

260
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,520
but is in part of our job as well

261
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,010
to protect the other seven billion
people who don't get it

262
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,330
who do not understand that there's only
if few million others around the world

263
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,700
really understand this stuff and this is
probably the biggest example of what

264
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,980
went wrong

265
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,020
2007 iPhone came out it was awesome it
was cool it was great

266
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,850
how much security is an iPhone

267
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,100
how much any

268
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,290
there'll none

269
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,880
we introduce the technology that now has
over over to

270
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,780
billion devices out there and we as the
community

271
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,430
didn't challenger early enough

272
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,230
again they said MDM you'll be fine it's
plenty secure

273
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,730
all we have local crypto plenty secure

274
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,450
you have a four digit PIN to protect
your privacy

275
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,310
your party secured that's what they have
been telling

276
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,470
our industry that's what the vendors
have been saying and no offense to the

277
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,800
vendors in the rear

278
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,530
but I so love you may have heard
MobileIron the MBM Company

279
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,840
got own last week

280
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,070
they got own take a look it's all out
there in the news and it happened to the

281
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,450
United Kingdom

282
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,890
certain portions love in the mobile
space

283
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,730
we have again allowed the people said
don't worry about it

284
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,900
to win and what's happened then you'll
be hearing some mobile talks here

285
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,890
over the next couple days that are going
to get into the malware explosion

286
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,630
and we're gonna see what exactly the
same thing

287
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,340
we saw happen with first-generation
computers

288
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,680
second-generation first generation
networks

289
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,340
and a while if you've grown up through
the since but you're new to the field

290
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,680
this is a total repeat

291
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,410
up the same failures that we

292
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,310
as the community could all split say
which was all her fault

293
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,790
for not hacking it early enough

294
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:53,150
the fastest growing technology in the
history of the planet

295
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,840
and it's completely insecure whose fault
is that

296
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,850
I think that we as a community have a
responsibility

297
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,250
to get into look at technology hacked
early

298
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,160
an hack it hard these mobile devices

299
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,580
how many have you have built-in
geo-location

300
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,830
in your mobile device that would set a
separate set %uh

301
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,900
rules depending upon where you are

302
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,310
now some %uh view mothers guy in the
back you'll hear from tomorrow

303
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,960
he goes the china fairly often how many
have you

304
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,760
show of hands would bring your
mobile.phone the China

305
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,090
art is one idiot

306
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,480
there's to Adri this wood-burning

307
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,780
should or should not the mobile
technology be treated

308
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,980
with the same sort of respect that we
would treat our enterprise

309
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,390
we're trying in in the businesses yet
because %uh some other threats in the

310
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,170
native in securities that we have known
about bath for over seven years

311
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,870
we still have them very very little to
make this technology

312
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,550
work based upon location we use GPS so
we can shop

313
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,070
and eat we don't use GPS based upon

314
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,850
risk up where i maybe

315
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,240
or were Jason maybe try in China or the
rules in

316
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,710
in the Middle East are very very cold
truly different have a certain things

317
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,060
that you just do not want to have on
your phone in some countries

318
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,080
so what do we do we have an extra phone
an extra phone

319
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,690
China phone on Middle East phone

320
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,970
we have bypassed the entire concept

321
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,470
and again I think this is a failure oval
treating mobile devices

322
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,150
like they are is our fault I criticize
the IT industry

323
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,010
and the security industry for allowing
some with this to happen

324
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,420
under the guise of don't worry

325
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,600
it's fine it's secure enough

326
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,370
and I have a problem with the phrase it
is secure enough and I hope you do as

327
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,550
well

328
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,690
the internet if terror you gonna be
hearing about some others over the

329
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,800
on next couple days the next speaker
Paul

330
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,490
he's gonna be talking about the angle on
the power grid words

331
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,480
all other scrap together

332
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,370
by the end of the decade somewhere
between 20 and 50

333
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,300
billion intelligent in points

334
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,140
that doesn't include RFID he's or chip
cards are

335
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,830
all the other things that we plugin and
the system's

336
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,090
how much security is being planned for
these

337
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,280
how much anybody know how which
securities being planned

338
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,550
balls going to cover some others would
be up our ankles ovett

339
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,230
Internet of Things is about how do I get

340
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,360
my refrigerator to call the grocery
store

341
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,020
to tell my car to automatically drive-by

342
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,490
and my food is ready for pickup and paid
for

343
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,380
convenience last night we were having a
whole discussion about this

344
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,510
it's about convenience

345
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,610
how do we use the community

346
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,260
help change people's minds that's that
convenience

347
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,050
doesn't at all mean security in most
cases it means

348
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,140
in security again part of the IT failure

349
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,460
and part of the hacking culture and the
security culture

350
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,320
we haven't done our jobs in getting the
word out enough

351
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,450
how do you have a car anybody been
involved with car hacking at

352
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,560
any had in the US at the I believe it's
the University of up of Ohio

353
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,100
they've actually started a hacking
school

354
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,970
on cars and do some research that is
coming out on top

355
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,950
the basically say do you really want to
drive

356
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,370
a car hands-free let the car do all the
driving for you

357
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,230
and now they're talking about removing
the steering wheel

358
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,970
are we ready for this technology to be
deployed on the streets

359
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,030
how much security is actually build into
these things

360
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,030
and right now we know that on star

361
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,100
has been hacked but we waited fifteen
years

362
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,200
why didn't we hacked it sooner

363
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,290
so I'm encouraging again somebody's
technology start hacking the bejesus out

364
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:33,720
of them

365
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,890
now some other protocols involved with
the Internet of Things

366
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,680
is atrocious it makes TCPIP

367
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,770
looks secure it is so bad in many cases

368
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,430
take a look at some of these
technologies all you're gonna be hearing

369
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,059
from Paul's mother but I C as in SCADA
systems again

370
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:57,480
something we've ignored these
technologies go back 30 years fifty

371
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,280
years

372
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,730
on some cases in the US more than a
hundred years

373
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,620
can you hack ICS and SCADA hell yah why
have we not

374
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,950
done something about it it's back to
those three words

375
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,550
apathy arrogance and ignorance and
people

376
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,760
not caring and not believing

377
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,400
it'll ever upper we

378
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,870
should know better than that I'm not to
take anything away from Paul

379
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,710
but we had a good debate last night
about do I even want to be connected to

380
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,480
the grid

381
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,010
anymore at all how do I get off the grid

382
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,600
you point that a law that I believe in
the US correct me if I'm wrong Paul

383
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,340
at or in some places you are required by
law

384
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,930
to connect to the grid even if you have
your own power plant

385
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,630
and that is the opposite of what most
diverse I hope would think

386
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,130
pausing to get involved with a lot of
this area for us

387
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,850
again I grew up in the analog world and
we did a lot of

388
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,070
remote recording we were in the
recording studios doing concerts

389
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,030
and one of the biggest problems that we
had

390
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,990
was called EMRI electromagnetic
interference

391
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:23,110
and as anybody ever picked up a radio
station on their teeth

392
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,330
it happens from time to time especially
for old guys like me with the

393
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,030
old fillings and they turn into diodes

394
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,070
which means that them its rectifying and
picking up the

395
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,400
up the high-frequency electromagnetic
waves it's an interference

396
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,750
now been put on my bad guy had

397
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,740
fight take high-power

398
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,130
high-power types of electromagnetic
interference

399
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,530
how much damage can I do was a bad guy

400
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,480
as anybody ever played with cell phone
jammers

401
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,710
he's gonna get more evil we need you to
be more

402
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,870
evil the cell phone jammers real simple
you can build in for

403
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,510
was a dare we talked about it was like
20 bucks he put together some stuff and

404
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,150
Zack

405
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,040
all cell phones are to host

406
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,460
back in the old days we used to be able
to actually force

407
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:23,370
interference in member you said TVs with
antennas

408
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,780
how do you mess with the neighbors TV

409
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,680
well we did it because we were kids that
we were just screwing around

410
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,809
so when we start looking at the
capability of influencing electronics

411
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,090
electronics today and our ninety-nine
point nine percent of our current

412
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,110
infrastructure

413
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,880
is susceptible to electromagnetic
interference

414
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,700
varying strengths and it's not terribly
difficult to do

415
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,340
on the lower right that's a military
system that use for high-power microwave

416
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,610
and system jamming in warfare

417
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,980
the lower left five hundred dollars
takes them computers for a prolonged

418
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,940
matter

419
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,150
are the bad guys ever going to use this

420
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,790
how much protection have we done

421
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,550
how much attacking have we done in the
community to understand

422
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,030
what the military is not telling is
because largely the stuff is all very

423
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,470
very heavily classified

424
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,160
let's unclassifiable its bring it out
into the open the way it should be

425
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,350
your summer the schematics often builds
on these things and again purcell

426
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,800
analog technology don't have to worry
about JavaScript or anything you don't

427
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,520
have to be precise

428
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,240
in these cases you just have to make a
boatload of Norway's

429
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,240
electromagnetically the screw with
systems

430
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,530
how many fewer been hacking UAV jet
anybody

431
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,190
I we got one why aren't we hack in UAB's

432
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,250
now the US I don't know the what's
happened with the rules over here

433
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,340
there's certain height limits that you
can only fly your UAB

434
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,090
out seven hundred feeder in some areas
maybe a thousand feet

435
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,140
off the ground I'll tell me if I'm wrong
here but bad guys will follow the law

436
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,900
right

437
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,230
are we gonna deliver Domino's Pizza yet

438
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,360
Amazon's gonna start playing with this
is the delivery system

439
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,080
happening all over and now we're talking
about the plowing

440
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,840
a mechanical system that's functionally
analog

441
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,130
using electromagnetic waves and order to
control it

442
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,400
where is the security

443
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,820
do we want these things falling on the
streets and highways

444
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,860
what's going to happen the lawyers are
going to get involved and start to

445
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,540
banning the very technology that's gonna
help us

446
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,690
if we approached it correctly

447
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,490
Arthur dual channel I will ban
communication fail safe

448
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,220
overrides and many others nope nope

449
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,050
should there be probably I'm not another
the designer

450
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,260
the beach but you guys are smart enough
how long should we designed this

451
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,590
technology

452
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,070
with security at Step number one

453
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,710
before we start deploying the hell out a
bit like we did with mobile phones

454
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,790
this is gonna be the next mobile phone
with the sheer numbers of them coming

455
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,730
out

456
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,580
or do we just end up having the ball
band not you can have you a visa anymore

457
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,690
which means that the criminals will
never use them right

458
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,429
has that work force in the past

459
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:59,860
so let's take the concert the so let's
take the concept that ultra miniature

460
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,160
books we figured out about seven years
ago

461
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,270
how birds and bugs and B's

462
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,340
actually flew finally figured out how
the aerodynamics work that we were able

463
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,470
to duplicate it

464
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,950
so on the lower right guys finger

465
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,620
that as an autonomous a UV UAB

466
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,210
with some amount of intelligence you
don't need a lot of intelligence and

467
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,059
many of these because the concept is
swarming

468
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,440
and swarming again is and analog concept

469
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,640
up creating distributed intelligence
claimed like

470
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,660
the board if you will and fuel take a
little bit research not want the

471
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,080
robotics that are being currently design

472
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,290
are taking that same approach

473
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:54,030
looking at simple rule sets very very
simple rules thats

474
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,750
and applying them across tens of
thousands and ultimately on the

475
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,220
nano-scale tens of billions of devices

476
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,650
are we having it yet

477
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:10,270
no why not because the utility

478
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,510
the conveniences what comes first

479
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,679
and we're going to deploy these things

480
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,320
and then we're going to have to solve
whether it's in 10 years

481
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,160
or twenty years the other problems you
have with these is now they're starting

482
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,100
to make them

483
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,490
look like biological elements

484
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,290
real real bugs so you go into your board
meeting you going to a super secret

485
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,730
meeting at the office

486
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,540
there's a fly on the wall

487
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,920
what is it is a biological

488
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,660
or is it in audio/video interception
surveillance device

489
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,270
run by government of your choice or
competitor if your choice

490
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:02,360
how are we going to know unless we start
looking at the downside

491
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,720
risk above all others new technology
that's coming out

492
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,240
his right now who's won in all this is
all being done largely

493
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,910
by government-funded research has a lot
of money involved it's

494
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,950
now in academia and what is the sound
like the sounds like the development of

495
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,260
the Internet

496
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,340
all over again and unregulated

497
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,140
not security based approach to
technological development

498
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,340
it's going to get worse we've now got
some great technology as we start to

499
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,480
understand neural pathways

500
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,520
how the brain works in everything
connects

501
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,590
I don't know much about any of that but
I do know that

502
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,710
we got prosthetics going where they're
able now to make the prosthetics with

503
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,650
the sensors built into them

504
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,299
convince the brain bat bat prosthetic
Israel

505
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:59,470
we've learned enough about the neocortex
and how to do that

506
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,850
what's the downside risk here

507
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,760
has anybody been hacking leisure

508
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,549
or what about the ones that are taking
now with the brain implants

509
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:14,330
take allowing quadriplegics and
paraplegics

510
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,170
to be able to feel and touch in interact
with their physical environment

511
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,030
using fundamentally in security
technology

512
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,600
why aren't we had doing this stuff the
same time

513
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,980
at the beginning love the life cycle

514
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,130
the early part of the life cycle instead
of waiting for

515
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,490
get deployed and then some fools start

516
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:48,590
messin around in ways that they are
going to have a direct impact upon life

517
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,809
so oliver's that's not me by the word

518
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,870
all others really scares me because

519
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,840
I've lived I've seen it

520
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,299
some love you have seen a lot of this
with me over the years

521
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,380
we have just made the mistakes that
really scares me

522
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,770
that we're gonna do it again

523
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,409
we're gonna make the same mistakes over
and over again

524
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:17,540
unless we in the community sort say whoa
we go to plead out

525
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,750
early early early in the development

526
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,710
and research cycles not wait for Java

527
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,950
version 6.0 what about Java version .5

528
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,649
would we do there now to be fine don't
worry about it will come out little work

529
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,919
and we'll fix it in a patch we have this
incredible patch mindset that will fix

530
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,340
it

531
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,119
afterwards in the record business

532
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,230
there's a parallel we would go out and
record

533
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,290
a band and if the war errors

534
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,649
the phrase we used was it's okay

535
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:59,119
will fix it in the mix meaning we get
back to the studio

536
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,859
and we can then repair the bad notes or
whatever it is and and today we're

537
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:07,220
seeing exactly the same thing that's why
some audio just sucks

538
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,840
awful will fix it later

539
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,050
same thing here we're now to be
basically saying I'm gonna go back to

540
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,770
the mobile

541
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,100
that's the one that really set me off

542
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,560
we're gonna fix it later if we

543
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,820
don't get fixing things a lot earlier
we're gonna have more and more

544
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,619
love the same and it's going to get
increasingly worse

545
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:35,790
has been an issue and big debate last
night

546
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,000
and we're gonna be talking about this
during the and SAT snowden though global

547
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,700
surveillance

548
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,830
is privacy we have any

549
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,670
does even exist right now or was this

550
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,460
was privacy one of those things

551
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,910
that because we chose to ignore security

552
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,250
we have allowed it to disappear from our
lives

553
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,340
out of convenience did we make that
decision is the IT community

554
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:15,119
as part of the security community for
the convenience of seven billion people

555
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,859
what is the downside of this and you'll
be hearing a lot of this that the debate

556
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:20,960
tomorrow afternoon

557
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,310
do we have any privacy or not but others
the hell outta me in many ways

558
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,660
bothers other people whole helluva lot
more than me in some cases

559
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,190
and then what is the average user

560
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,070
thing the average user doesn't know

561
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,640
and again that's part of power failure

562
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,390
Carrington affect anybody know what the
current a fact

563
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,460
in 1850 9 the current year

564
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,700
yep there was a huge solar storm

565
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,320
the Telegraph networks had just started

566
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,980
being deployed all across the United
States

567
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,060
UK some here in Europe

568
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,450
turns in effect discharge was called to
see

569
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,359
ami call lolol mass ejection

570
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:14,940
which is basically a solar flare larger
than the planet Earth

571
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,780
when it hit earth if ride out the entire
telegraph system

572
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,560
now for those of you may have followed
have you been watching the solar

573
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,100
activity in predictions from nasa

574
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,618
and ESA over the last couple years

575
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,460
there was a solar flare that miss the
earth about three months ago

576
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,869
that would have taken out satellites

577
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,250
they're still predicting more and more
of this and if you look at some other

578
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,109
solar activities

579
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:48,200
is the chance something's gone

580
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,100
what happens if one hits the earth today
anybody know

581
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,359
what happens if those CME hits the
planet

582
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,790
you don't know ok it first the
satellites go

583
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:06,810
what's the next thing to go power
transformers

584
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,380
a planet without power

585
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,900
we haven't planned for things that we
knew

586
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,770
is there a way there are some answers
that is in the answers to this problem

587
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,140
actually yr old

588
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,910
antique analog electrical engineering

589
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,480
and Paul value you getta some others
perhaps more about how to protect

590
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,250
against something like this but it
requires number one an admission

591
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,450
but it can happen number two

592
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,650
that the devastation it would cause

593
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,440
is pretty damn bad and number three it
would require

594
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,720
which won't happen cooperation

595
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,619
between power companies governments

596
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,300
and users as the is a defense

597
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,730
and women's one search coming our way we
will have

598
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,260
roughly the three days

599
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,470
to protect the entire planet

600
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,750
anybody wants to know the answer I'll
give it to you later

601
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,340
so my answers for all of us

602
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,740
these are not hard answers these are
things hopefully to get you to think

603
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,290
we gotta take the lead we really need to
take the lead

604
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,460
in this and at the this community

605
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,609
should be fearless absolutely fearless
when it comes to attacking

606
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:31,869
new technologies not outta are being
evil

607
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,900
that we were accused of thirty years ago

608
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,119
but out love bro active defense

609
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,430
for the things that we know are coming

610
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,430
simplicity where is the simplicity we

611
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,520
now go to complex city

612
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,830
why because no offense to the vendors

613
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:59,780
version to is always better than version
1

614
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,460
you have to upgrade and how those go

615
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,330
that anybody have a i is Adam Android
upgraded absolutely killed

616
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,040
everything on my phone at a rebuild it
all

617
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,650
we could take the lead on these things
graceful degradation

618
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,070
how many of your clients how many have
your organization's

619
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,099
have a way that if a significant piece
up your network

620
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:27,349
is corrupted do you have a way

621
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:31,550
to shut it down without hurting your
company

622
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:37,690
wasn't designed with redone been see I'm
not talking a generator and backup

623
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,310
i'm talking about. true redone dency
communication

624
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,410
out group and mechanisms to be able to
have

625
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,540
long-term survivability

626
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,230
in mission-critical areas

627
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,849
there's very very few of these again
we're doing it for convenience

628
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:00,150
make it easy were giving

629
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,470
users up there on the upper

630
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,000
rate what do they need

631
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,170
more what's in the lower

632
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:17,300
word I use word every single day there's
what 27,000 menus and options inside

633
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,869
word how many do I use

634
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:24,500
Times Roman and indent

635
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,510
and maybe I'll change the font size but
the complexity

636
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,420
that we're building into these things is
getting absurd

637
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,300
it started out that these were
telephones

638
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,530
then they were texting machines

639
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,930
now they're replacing our entire
computer infrastructure

640
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,260
and we're adding more and more and more
complexity

641
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,220
at the hardware level the firmware level
and the software level

642
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,050
not to mention what's going on over the
airwaves I think

643
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,290
it is our responsibility as the
community to push

644
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,450
harder and harder and harder

645
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,849
with these new emerging technologies

646
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:11,869
before they are deployed

647
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:15,960
its our responsibility to show the
dangers of the early on

648
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,150
and not to buy into the bullshit that
comes out of the vendors and some

649
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,920
researchers who said

650
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,830
don't worry you'll be fine

651
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,570
thank you very much for your attention
I'm here well as if I have some time

652
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:38,570
I'll answer a couple questions

653
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,750
do I have time for any questions Leila
or not

654
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,330
you I don't see any hands up

655
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,330
I don't see any hands up hi Jason

656
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:53,359
%uh he's good shoot me okay alright
Jason

657
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,599
I does that uses the your thing about
china

658
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,010
bring your cell phone over so you're
saying that basically when your cell

659
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,570
phone is in the US is perfectly safe for
monitoring from government right

660
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,710
thanks so your mobile devices tolley
perfectly OK

661
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,550
in and the US to be used what I said
Jason if you had actually paid attention

662
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,570
while

663
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,859
our got a little bit but not much I said
that cell phone and GPS should be

664
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:22,010
based upon risk I did not say

665
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:28,609
whose risk where risk is your choice
your company's choice to determine

666
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:32,300
whether you if I mean you may not want
to use a cell phone in the US at all

667
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,000
depending upon your political beliefs

668
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,070
maybe you want to go back to a Nokia
anybody remember Nokia

669
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,970
you have a used to be a phone company

670
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,390
so no i i appreciate your point but now
it's a risk based analysis that we are

671
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,530
not paying attention to

672
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,800
any other thoughts or comments

673
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,220
okay again thank you very much in our
next speaker is Paul

674
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,960

gonna take you down a couple are the

675
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,670
roads
