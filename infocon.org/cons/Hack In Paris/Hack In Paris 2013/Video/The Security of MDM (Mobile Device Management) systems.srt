8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,000
I with Turkey about smart devices Boii
BYOD and

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,390
this kind of terms about what is an MDM

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,960
and the differences between the
different levels of MGM's

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,890
secure into Indian markets and then I
will talk about

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,960
the security of summer those products

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,600
invisible afflicts the number else's
themself I'm not very important

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,210
wasn't what is important is 22 shows
that sell different

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,649
and devices I'm US

17
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,970
and Android and you or so

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,510
have blackberry and Microsoft form

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,159
this is not something which is new you
already know that

20
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,159
and to manage in a in a complete knuckle
proud to be able to manage these devices

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,520
you need a system and there are
different kinds of systems

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,210
MTM means mobile device management

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,700
to go to find nvm this to manage the
device

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,610
themself am I will fuck you stand during
his presentation about

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,340
and %um but I will talk a little bit
about sir also

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,970
mmm systems Meem

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,540
is to manage applications it's a little
bit

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,720
like a private App Store or Google Play

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,430
private to work a company and MCM

30
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,890
is to manage content not application
themself

31
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,790
but content very often through you find
a mix

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,770
%uh so different some have is different
systems

33
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,220
inside a product i said i refer to stand

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,510
and %um typical features of

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,989
MGM I'm are listed there fast

36
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:26,080
you need an MGM to be a bone to track

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,709
your devices you know to new assets

38
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,150
your hardware then to

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,470
to manage software software I i mean

40
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,750
operating system for example to be able
to tell you

41
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,209
use a only using a recent version

42
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,709
I was a parking system it could be used

43
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,440
or so it depends gender the product but
it could be used to

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,150
manage to define expenses from

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,470
that in this case is and the product as
to coordinate

46
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,680
wheeze your Tiffany provider it could be
you so so far

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,629
devised for a change so lucky position
it's an option most of the time

48
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,840
it could be useful backup restore and

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,180
remote looking wipe if you lose

50
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,140
a device and petitions deployment

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,450
application deployment is more Meem

52
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,720
future butts you find its must have the
time

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,920
in MGM products as else have all

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,920
terms around MGM mmm

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,790
VM already talk about BYOD bring your
own device

56
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,299
the devices long is is both and gone by
the employees

57
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,299
and do you love and as a mother which is
CUPE

58
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,650
its corporate onto personally enabled

59
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,990
it's less the

60
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,310
and it's less come in today but it's an
interesting model

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,060
the devices property

62
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,600
up the company but as an employee you
are allowed to install for example your

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,709
private email

64
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,569
differences between these different
models is

65
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:14,000
with this coast soco's to the device you

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,380
is a device are you company is paying
the device the ownership

67
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,790
on the ship of the data even if it's not
very clear

68
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,280
even too few on your device its you

69
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,180
private emails it's not very clear if
the company

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,520
some rights on this day to haunt and

71
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,220
management I will not some a

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,480
would continue missiles arm suspects

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,900
you off a different kind up from a
mobile device

74
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,479
management system some are using a Nokia

75
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,240
and network operations center a central

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,680
relay is some for several somewhere like
blackberry

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,630
and good technology's and some are not
using

78
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,669
a central server and it does some
implication

79
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,880
regarding some Metro configuration for
example a

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,890
we'll talk more about that later Gulf

81
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,120
arm to simplify of three different
mothers suffer deployment

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,900
you can deploy most of the time
on-premise

83
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,090
in virtual machine it could be on
physical mission but today it's more on

84
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,240
physical selves

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,070
you can buy in the Bryans are you could
be clerk

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,500
cloud-based and more and more from

87
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,539
you have this first three different

88
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,890
possibilities for 1 products as a
difference with this cloud space is that

89
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,010
you are renting

90
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,100
you are not buying you are rin tin

91
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,410
in this presentation

92
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,510
I will for accused on on-premise

93
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,090
their kids this is a joy Graham phone
got now

94
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,099
from you have some apps are

95
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,220
some MGM products and

96
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,240
some you have now watch mobile

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,760
I run Citrix SAP good technology info
Collinge

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,020
and I we fuck used on my bad I run

99
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,510
and good technologies so

100
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,010
with meh but I wrong you are able to
manage devices

101
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,890
as the support the US and related
Blackberry Windows Phone and some

102
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,570
was a mothers you can build an
enterprise

103
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,659
App Store you can integrate

104
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:45,000
this system wheeze the you enterprise
because the supposed to a nuclear

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,310
and the PI it could be for example for
the environment

106
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,610
to put you on business large during the

107
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,840
enrollment and say the other

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,960
MTM product up your engine products and
and as a product which is called sentry

109
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,500
which is an exchange all religious nuts
books each them

110
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,789
as I said to produce eliza is no not
catch

111
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,950
and you can install

112
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,970
on-premise are a cloud-based I think
they also have a firm

113
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,349
an appliance I forget to to put its
something which is important is that

114
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:23,530
cell using

115
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,140
native applications if you are using an
iPhone

116
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,690
you will use them mail

117
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,729
application made by people and

118
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,110
this is different from from good was
good

119
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,949
you can also manage devices I'll

120
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,599
not supporting blackberry and I

121
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,830
things as they will not support
blackberry in for the future

122
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,580
and you can also be done enterprise app
store

123
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,080
and contrary to my but I run

124
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,180
and to access to to the email to
exchange look

125
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,180
Exchange Server you have to go through
so

126
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,539
good cells they are using an arc

127
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,729
so there is always a cell somewhere and
and Internet

128
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,970
and which relays every

129
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,190
data and values innings up on

130
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,330
applications you have an application

131
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,919
with emails so means business to
millions

132
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,919
business calendar and business contact
the few who

133
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,300
if you are looking at this as a as a
security with what they say about

134
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,890
security

135
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,149
the use a security world everywhere

136
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,310
for them it's a a strong

137
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,589
marketing the I'm advantage i

138
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,640
not know exactly how to say that and

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,170
the fume make some research on the
internet it's possible to find some

140
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,430
some things but not so much they should
look at CE

141
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,680
there is nothing nothing regarding

142
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,670
good in my room if you look at exploit
DB

143
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,130
there is one entry and two weeks ago

144
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,209
I will talk shit a little more about
that and

145
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,940
there is also paper arm an article

146
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,350
about good Akeem on up in security
research

147
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,620
and the paper about from I said

148
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,720
buttons I will talk about this different

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,240
people's later you find also something
about Skype

150
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,990
but have this problem is not specific to
mobilize the bus

151
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,640
management system some and ex-con

152
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,810
its an application you can find on Cydia

153
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,529
is to remove surgeon break detection so
they are not

154
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,290
lot of of problems

155
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,890
of will not be disclosed so apparently
this public so

156
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,350
good I they say them living in
Switzerland

157
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,190
and insists on and we have a lot of
things we have to create

158
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,640
we have Swiss knives ku klux

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,670
watches and most important

160
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,970
we have banks

161
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,029
was a lot of money and

162
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:26,029
your money I'll money off your
politician

163
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,480
and thank you for that

164
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,620
and mango or

165
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,639
and muster the time I'm if

166
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,649
it's possible phone operator for MGM

167
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,899
a min using good are meh but I run

168
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,149
to steal emails resultant any

169
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,370
Association and if it's possible is it's
traceable

170
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,940
in other times is it possible to

171
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,790
steal information and Sen and sells them
to Germany

172
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:06,290
France and you know who are United
States and

173
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,139
it was not possible to tests these
products completely

174
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,949
they are little bitch and dick fines

175
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:17,819
so I choose to fuck used on the on
installation

176
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,880
deployment and will not of device

177
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,519
ants arm I spent the majority of my time

178
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,790
onsite management interfaces i MID

179
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,970
to several is I'm of tests month once
every last year

180
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,500
and another one

181
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,600
this month last year have tested myron
in goods

182
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,610
but this month I have tested on the

183
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,700
mmm I'm about to run and

184
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,310
some its both with exchange and
on-premise

185
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,029
in a virtual machine owned by been

186
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,180
okay so regarding the deployment

187
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,339
I'm res good we have a notch

188
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,660
so it's possible to relay months and the
truck traffic

189
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,190
so your devices are connected to the not

190
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,720
somewhere on the internet and you MDM
server is also connected

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,890
to was a good Selva somewhere on the
internet so

192
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,550
you only have outgoing network
connections

193
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,839
you don't have to make in your in your
file your

194
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,130
so it's a good point this is

195
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,450
what this said it's true butts yours

196
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:40,230
you need to open something because to be
able to enroll devices

197
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,610
you need to access a self-service bottle

198
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:50,150
so there is more one pot if we bring

199
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,860
compare always meron it's very different
some reason to not touch

200
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,900
so your devices

201
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,450
%ah connected directly to you MDM server

202
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,570
and you have to open some ports on your
firewall

203
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,029
this is a

204
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,550
a list of books I think it's almost
complete

205
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm you also have to open

206
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,130
your firewall between your dreams that

207
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,950
and you into not sell them I just I
forget something

208
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,820
with my but I run not know but I run

209
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,890
some real was good

210
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,250
something which is a little bit strange
for me is that

211
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,130
you can to put your such as a cell value
yourself in the gym that

212
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,620
technically you can but if you do so

213
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,320
you lose the a silly it's like that

214
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,430
I have them why to tell me

215
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,990
but you don't need them gyms that
because you only have

216
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,010
outgoing network requests watchin

217
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:01,720
mind that okay so investors you need to
the

218
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,779
to open some some halls between

219
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,900
your claims that and exchange for
example

220
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,180
from and GP and

221
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,650
mmm to be able to access you make change
cell

222
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,670
okay so this is Phil's a

223
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,990
for the network regarding operating
systems

224
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,339
my but I run is using the sent to us and
good is using

225
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,130
window souter Windows Server 2003

226
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,140
2008 I'm not sure yet Zaza

227
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,260
supporting to the to those 2012

228
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,670
and if we look at add to that the
processes

229
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,560
running the MGM was good

230
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,230
the MGM itself answer themself this is

231
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,180
are running as an administrator %uh
December and you have no choice

232
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,339
it's not possible to removes that after
installation

233
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,829
again then says it on me

234
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,310
you can try but if you do so you lose a
silly

235
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,589
a kid reasonable I run it's different

236
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,980
as they are using a classical Linux some

237
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,540
deployment Reza use of forced them to
that

238
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:20,540
use of a bitch she my sequin excedrin
regarding exchange

239
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,120
mmm as I said meron is

240
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,670
as a some sort of proxy as a call this a

241
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,829
central its and negative sink mmm

242
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:36,490
proxy what's it do is

243
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,800
the linkage a device two years a user

244
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,180
if you try to access emails I'm

245
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,850
I I try to access my emails but not from
my device from

246
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,920
and as a device that would be refused
and for good

247
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,730
and everything is palm

248
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,490
yes everything is going to sit through
its a good several so you have to give

249
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,400
to gift was a good seller almost all
rights to

250
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,800
the exchange mailboxes so

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,160
when you're reading males whiz because a
good a petition on you

252
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,980
newell on your device you are not ready
inge

253
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,480
the women's goods is a good seller is
reading

254
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,980
the Indians and there is a weighted to

255
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,189
read find a new sweater to read the
emails of someone else

256
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:31,980
just us to to enroll in the device

257
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,860
and it's possible fun in his first to
normally when you do that

258
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,930
the victim when we receive an email
saying that

259
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,930
follow this process deal to register a
new device but as an administrator

260
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,569
you can remove this option you can
remove the menu

261
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:52,130
and as there is no need for the Paso up
the account

262
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,470
and you register the device and that's
all your able to read

263
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,550
females it was documented by

264
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,510
opened security research in a problem
2012

265
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,409
and now I will talk about sir and his
tuition interface

266
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,490
and I would fuck use mainly on the but I
run

267
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,780
and I will talk a little bit about good
something which is important to what I

268
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,720
would show you

269
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,780
is from last year and to their feelings
on it

270
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,339
amounted to be different

271
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:29,030
okay so this is the administration
interface of me but I run it's our web

272
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,040
portal

273
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,590
you have a a list of devices

274
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,100
so you have a a list of devices I have
only one in this screenshot

275
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,780
and different times to configure
policies

276
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,390
this kind of things you can have some
details

277
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,840
about so the device I'm

278
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,909
exception and

279
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:58,020
the fasts thing its I what they call a
midget request

280
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,700
because for me it's really match you
sent

281
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,500
a simple request with get local user

282
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,530
and you get the pass Elden clear

283
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,640
of your colleagues

284
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,500
it's much of course you need to be

285
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,280
not not on the administrator but you
need some access

286
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,820
to lose a administration interface arm

287
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,159
if you are not authenticated it would
not work but

288
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,050
you are able to find in clear the
passing on of your colleagues

289
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,750
in this example this is my bus welcome
and this is the best I love my college

290
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,190
which is good for two min

291
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,860
and as a magic requests very similar its

292
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,260
this time week regarding LDAP

293
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,050
with no but I run you can configure mmm

294
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,140
you can connect limbs amo by

295
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,409
device management uses them to active
directory

296
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:02,590
so when your use our accessing the
mailbox

297
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,580
czar they are validating by Active
Directory all some

298
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,650
LDAP and the to

299
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,020
to do that's the MDM server on the
Internet comment

300
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,330
and the Active Directory it's going to
go somewhere

301
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,600
and again you can retrieve this bus
filled in clear wheeze

302
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,980
this simple get to request

303
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,710
so in this case it's Ian and wine

304
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,460
my desi it's such it's a it's a
development mistake

305
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,840
and self some objects somewhere

306
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,030
and the you when they receive

307
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,159
so someone is receiving this get
something

308
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,190
that just serialize the objects which is
in memory

309
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,820
and sirens if I get to remove the
possibilites

310
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,490
and that time you you are able to
retrieve

311
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,570
the password

312
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,460
the next step is to try to find
cross-site scripting

313
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,050
and sell process scripting in values
places

314
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,300
that's not fair really complicated in
this example it's in labels you can

315
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,840
define some labourers in some rules in
Labor's

316
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,480
and you just put after San

317
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,780
Sosa the name you choose you put

318
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,280
for example this it's a simple image tax

319
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
with an image which does not exist and

320
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,919
fun history got and your office

321
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,280
very simple precise Krypton and czar

322
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,659
for 615 values bases

323
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,570
am this is an example a month from good

324
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,710
from from good it's missile little bit
different

325
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,320
but because I from trees are using some
framework

326
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,870
some anti cross-site scripting library

327
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,540
but suffer gets to use it in one place

328
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,419
but on the in one place

329
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:07,480
some you are able to to use a cross-site
scripting vulnerability

330
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,139
butts um up for me

331
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,669
is now using HTTP only attributes

332
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,770
so it's not possible it's not simple

333
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,040
from %uh JavaScript to

334
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,520
Marie tree for example just session
cookie

335
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,200
mmm my but I runs or so using this

336
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,770
HTTP option and to

337
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,260
avoid framing so management interface so

338
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,740
that takes into account some some risk

339
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,200
mmm but some in the very busy

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,360
security mistakes

341
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,389
the next step is to try to find
cross-site request forgery

342
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:54,320
and moms are cross-site request forgery
mistakes

343
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,700
everywhere on every page and something
which is in

344
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,470
interesting fun at Acura is that's even
tissue other posts

345
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,840
you can transform the post into a get
and it's far more easier

346
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
to exploit get I get you can just

347
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,060
p use an image for example and the post
is a little bit

348
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,850
more complicated for good seats

349
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,270
not exactly the same after a site script
the cross-site request forgery problems

350
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,690
almost everywhere but it's not possible
to transform a post into a get

351
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,820
so very fine that you aren't using a
post

352
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,530
whens expert expected post

353
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,590
with that we have built some proof of
concepts

354
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,710
and one of a one example just two

355
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,240
remove the Pasco the for my phone

356
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
and you can configure an iPhone to

357
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,419
wheeze a passcode in to be able to
access iPhone

358
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:59,000
you need to unlock the device

359
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,290
but there are some exception to that

360
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,770
for example if you connect by USB cable

361
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,960
the the phone to iTunes

362
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
iTunes and your a few you have to Anoka

363
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,159
at least one time but after even if the
device is locked

364
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,649
you I bernard iTunes able visible to
make a backup

365
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:27,020
so he's able to access the phone

366
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,860
the even if the phone is locked and and
as I exception

367
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,429
is MGM this is done by the bullets on
purpose

368
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:40,669
am the MDM I'm API from paper is private

369
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,570
but the saris there is an API

370
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,580
to enlarge the fun it's not to unlock
the phone is to remove the passcode

371
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,159
and since good is the good snow but I
wrong

372
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,250
liza nvm you we can exploit such so we
have been to us more proof of concept

373
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,490
and by exploiting cross-site request
forgery

374
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,100
and with that we were able to remove to
pass got

375
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,310
from the iPhone

376
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,200
its this imposes a request again is very
simple

377
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,310
something like that sorry its return
unlocked

378
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:24,230
unlock but in fact it will not unlock
the phone between removes the passcode

379
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,550
and you just have to to put India so the

380
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,780
UUID up the phone

381
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,630
of course you need something to deliver
his kind of payload

382
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:40,320
reserve cross-site scripting for example

383
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,899
we have mental a similar prefer full set
is good

384
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,010
and this time it was more complicated we
have two

385
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,480
combines three different you're not
gonna vulnerabilities across a scripting

386
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,460
a cross-site request forgery in ataturk
rage

387
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,590
and this way we're able to give

388
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:06,110
admin rights to any user

389
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,980
its is not exactly %uh the exploits

390
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,780
but it's very similar to that

391
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:20,780
in this case we have to use a post as I
said it's not possible to use a get

392
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,730
I'm I said that I showed you was a and
ministration interface

393
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,030
a fun but I run but cev and as a
interface

394
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,220
a command line interface which is
accessible

395
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,560
on the device itself under southern
itself also through SSH or Telnet

396
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,960
you can disable internet I'm

397
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,800
and the you have something like that

398
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,389
it's very similar out to mmm I'm

399
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:54,379
to a Cisco router

400
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:57,580
yes you can entail some commands lacked
sure looks

401
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,990
for example sure look for example and

402
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,629
I'm I as I said

403
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:08,909
there is a an exploit which is
documented in exploit DB

404
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:13,909
two weeks ago and principle of his
exploits

405
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:17,450
is that when you are amusing the show
large

406
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,679
comment and done is now using less

407
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,950
and Zara named as route and

408
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,760
in less by default you can you are able
to run commands

409
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,030
shall commence Res this

410
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,100
exclamation Mark Hall point

411
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,220
all the pipes I'm but and

412
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,929
today it's patched

413
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:45,950
okay so that my that was a

414
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,649
the state last year

415
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:53,409
and today their fixed most obvious

416
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,280
security problems my point is that made
the

417
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,370
some security tests but

418
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:06,429
I am south till some some problems
remaining

419
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,899
especially regarding encryption most
products are using

420
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:14,270
a yes shy one shot to except for

421
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,570
cell Phillips sets itself defiant

422
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,710
okay so the implementation is apparently
good

423
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,360
but what about the keys

424
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,470
in Mumbai run to be able to mention to
try and mean

425
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,300
to to manage the system do you need a
loser

426
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,530
and in this case is not possible to
import

427
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,840
use of from Active Directory

428
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,110
it's like that you need to defined local
users

429
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:52,810
and this local users after on United
maximum fine identity conflict but XML

430
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,590
and you have to persuade here

431
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,169
which which is encrypted

432
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:04,270
if you do better so they are using

433
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,750
big 64 encoding yes encryption

434
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,510
wheeze SEP mod picture peaches

435
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,700
years 5 bedding okay the problem with
that

436
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,879
but the key is very simple Serkis
something like

437
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,940
aqui no matter per wetter wonderful

438
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,639
and I will not the Saints the last well

439
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:30,790
it's not world am

440
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,360
it's not a have not done a tape was a
typo

441
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,830
was done by is a developer or drops it
on purpose

442
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,409
and the just take this

443
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,609
bus phrase that make you shy one

444
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:48,580
one time and this is a key

445
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,869
so we made and as a proof-of-concept

446
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,030
am this keys the same so for every

447
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,409
installation answer is no salt no
iteration

448
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,830
there is one intermission no PB kids
left to us

449
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,950
something like that and term

450
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,340
we r wheezes our small Java petition we
are able to recover

451
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,270
or pass else Nam we already knows that

452
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,520
they are using some symmetric

453
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,460
encryption because we were able to
retrieve surpass all in clear

454
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Reza magic requests

455
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,859
the use the same encryption for values

456
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:32,940
information

457
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,460
and what about so the past 12

458
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,139
users of smart devices users

459
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:44,320
I was very surprised to find a column

460
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,190
asphalt in a table am I use a

461
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,929
and I have some users yeah

462
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:55,050
and this user girls

463
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:00,480
from then you're Audrey go for Team Anna
have or this impasse world

464
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,060
and uses that surpass twelve ash is the
same

465
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,190
for or it's not very complicated to

466
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,889
guess that it's a shy one the simple
show one was not sold

467
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:16,679
and something which is strange is that
the past selves encrypt the password is

468
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,129
different

469
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:22,260
but no it's not completely different
because

470
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,780
super so they've been known think the
personal opinion is the same

471
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,080
than 30 min

472
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,429
and its different so it's very very
strange

473
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:38,570
and if you make some tests you are able
to deduce that

474
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,580
in fact are using five keys

475
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,210
this keys up the same for every
installation

476
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,490
star this kid this keys are

477
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,960
initialize at runtime and up out got it

478
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,919
and transcripts the password so choose
one key

479
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:01,389
randomly and whens in need to verify a
pass felt

480
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:04,629
when when you're done to trade for
example the

481
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,760
very fire is each key one by one

482
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,540
and when it's working it's working and

483
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,730
mom this

484
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,310
plus other cash in fact is used to very
fine

485
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:23,169
SATs its the actually key

486
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:26,510
so a game we made a prints morn

487
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,830
Java application and we r a burn

488
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,040
to recover surpass world from a bicycle
databases

489
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,909
I'll mobile a run back to which are more
or less

490
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:42,510
the same thing so it means that in this
kind of installation

491
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,520
we are able to recover surpass all of

492
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,119
everybody everybody in using a smart
device

493
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,700
but swine it was very surprising

494
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,139
why ASIST orange this bus world's

495
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:01,760
because deserve and as a product which
is centrally

496
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,440
which is an ActiveSync proxy

497
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,280
so you are using know you're no more
male position

498
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,780
it communicates Reza as a proxy

499
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,310
and why are you weyerhauser

500
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:21,070
muscled stop on the MGM Selva

501
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,080
and wells a coming from

502
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,710
from the census service both or because
to I'm

503
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,599
register on your device users the user
asked to register also

504
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,320
yes to to take perhaps a copy surpass
felt the stalls a persona

505
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,339
at this time from the centrists over
from NASA

506
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:44,879
because at this moment whitaker a lot
about that

507
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,679
no in fact now the pass on

508
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,960
this coming from your device

509
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,089
when you're on the world your device you
have to install an agent

510
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:00,550
it's called Mumbai light rock and case
of my but I run

511
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,379
and you enter your password and at this
time

512
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:08,740
it is transmitted to the server and its
it is told

513
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,740
and it it took me a lot of time to
understand

514
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,970
winds out using doing that and

515
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,990
I discover recently that in fact it's an
option

516
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,190
you have the option save use up aswell

517
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,540
in if you read the documentation they
recommend

518
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,899
to said yes

519
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:33,080
to that and why it's because when

520
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,490
you up registering largest orange a new
device

521
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,000
you have the possibility to push and
Exchange

522
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,889
profile on a US for example

523
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,450
and with this options are a burn

524
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,450
to with the 22 to feel surpass world's

525
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,960
field automatically so it's for

526
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,470
user convenience be

527
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,099
action and will not talk to a lot about
edge into

528
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:07,330
on devices um you can find

529
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,109
mmm and information

530
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:15,129
on the Internet so our presentation

531
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:18,530
this showing blackouts by like rim which
is

532
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,750
practical attacks against mobile device
management

533
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,310
and it was a on others that agent

534
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:29,210
out how to break the sexual

535
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,290
mmm as a secure container I think it's

536
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,599
why vince says this mornings at

537
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,599
good is broken for Android they agree

538
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,250
but far US in my point of view to the

539
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,800
it's not exploitable because you have to
jailbreak

540
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,050
are using something similar to a job
rage and

541
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,839
when you generate today you have to
reboot so device

542
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,820
and you for you with the device
everything which is in memory

543
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,830
is is lost some the discover something

544
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,119
discovers the keys in memory but in my
point of view

545
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,200
it's not exploitable its exploitable in

546
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,900
unfurled saris and as a paper from

547
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,589
a sex partner else which is auditing
enterprise-class applications and secure

548
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:19,280
containers

549
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,810
on Android it was last year its

550
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,599
almost the same song like ruin as they
are

551
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,060
it's only on enjoy it its about

552
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,369
good and no but I run and say we're able
to to break

553
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,800
encryption to they were able to find
encryption keys

554
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,030
to break so as a secure container

555
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,280
and also to defeat roots detection

556
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,030
South server also

557
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:52,210
subjects around mmm the security and my
buyers device management systems

558
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,720
mo but I run is not using a

559
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,760
US keychains very well sell some
problems

560
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,830
Reza yes key generation was good

561
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,030
and the Nokia it's not prims re

562
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,380
prisoner met it's very close to that as
are some problems researcher break

563
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,440
detection or so

564
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,109
props fun is that ok so to conclude

565
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,410
the actual security of such

566
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,619
mother and device management systems is
very dependent

567
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:29,710
a few installation you have to review
every single detail

568
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,200
every single mmm

569
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,420
feature you have to be an expert of

570
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,170
those mobile device management system 12
something which is really secure

571
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,369
if you follow what they are recommended
the

572
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,530
you you often station which is not
secure it's also very dependent

573
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,920
of your deployment contexts I talk about

574
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,820
the Paul towards a surf self is spot on

575
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,910
it has to be somewhere on the internet

576
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,880
to be all you know wifi and and

577
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,710
most of the time several companies are
deploying these

578
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,190
as a public wifi are on the internets

579
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,599
it's not very easy to make a private
wifi for that

580
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,700
again by default sound that not
supporting private IP 68 for Exeter

581
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,540
I'm be this field is littered with new

582
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,660
as out improving but

583
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,210
cell still some some security problems

584
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,339
it's also difficult to say today if one
product

585
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,580
is better Sun another I'm

586
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,080
regarding network I prefer a good
because

587
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,980
you don't have to a pen horse in your
firewall

588
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,250
but I have some problems Reza with good
is generating

589
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,720
I use keys it's not very clear who is
generating the keys

590
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,240
am so the advantages and disadvantages

591
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,349
from BOS products and to finish a onto

592
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:10,599
thank you to my college most obvious
your own abilities well

593
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,280
discovered by I'm my fly my college and

594
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,020
shove Christian express yourself

595
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:27,020
here

596
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,060
no no question I have one

597
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,780
for myself I tried to contact

598
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm good and my but I run and

599
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,070
for good some reaction was okay you find
something

600
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,550
but you seen you sign when the contract

601
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,590
you there are not interested

602
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:59,720
at all by my discoveries and former but
I run it wasn't a bit different I sends

603
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,300
an

604
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,090
as a fast

605
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,480
as a fast might mention char requests
and

606
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,100
and things it put this in the black for

607
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,770
something like that frontally today is
they don't care

608
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:19,770
thank you here
