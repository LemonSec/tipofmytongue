1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,919
all so um hello everybody my name is
some

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,029
Jens meh I'm must assign student at the

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:11,030
University on of pool home a piece of
the developer

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,690
once in the time and currently into
block forensics

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,900
that's the type who may be

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,300
a bit misleading at this talk is
basically about among insects action

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,180
about them to be out of gathering

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,230
important information from I'm

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,109
that locked files um important in this
case means

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,140
um a text with alarm briefly discuss
various techniques

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,500
to find attacks against them %uh that
accept applications

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,850
also the pups ever but more are the
publications um

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,530
with selling it's essentially a long as
they can serve a standard doing based

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,480
approaches afterwards we'll try to
characterize these attacks

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,800
into himself from who did something and

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,809
what exactly what style are who

17
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,020
in this case refers to about the
attacker

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,580
like your arm you see are coming from
Switzerland

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,770
a you see up parked somewhat net or

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,170
from you see I'm a machine at some
stripped or see a human being

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,350
trying to get into I'm seeing I'm

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,240
what occurs to don't you take itself %uh
ruling on in terms of the

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
severity of the attack so we are trying
to at least %uh distinguished

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,619
between on successful and long
successful attacks

25
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,479
are ever seen showing the stock has been
implemented and

26
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,060
some prototype so you that can test it
with your a very own X locks

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,740
afterwards if you're curious so here's
our scenario

28
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,850
arm a.m. we are some customer 0

29
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,220
wherever some upside got contact got
owned %ah

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,290
sometimes daily pretty cool ASCII art
behind

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,299
now and other cases they try to steal a
very private

32
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,549
data and if you find it in the Internet
I which tennis maybe that's good

33
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:09,560
%ah in any case um probably some
application wasn't secure until

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,830
now we are interested in and how did it
we should be on

35
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,520
else I've just reset or service arm
would just get

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,930
went again next week so what do we do we
make an image of the disc we r

37
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,459
we look for suspicious files %uh perfect
or sense on

38
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,269
research for unusual activity in the log
files

39
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,670
are since we of course didn't use a what
security and audit logging

40
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,610
um we only have just done basic Apache
wrong

41
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,760
in doing so whatever excess locks which
is certainly a very common scenario for

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,150
post-op around six

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,209
um but for some reason luckily our

44
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,170
we all know we think that the lock parts
have not been manipulated because

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,659
de vere story with separate machine I
was crypto and a pendulum the end

46
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,879
we think the log files are fine a and
interior so

47
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,019
are with we think we have pretty good
chances to

48
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,349
to understand what happened are or not

49
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,319
a why the basic basic problem is so I
was like fuck

50
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,640
that they are preludes a and by youths
they i mean they can get

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,209
really really rich don't we are kind of
lazy and

52
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,670
at least we don't have the motivation to
a minority

53
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,519
manually refuel terabytes of luck for
data so

54
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,890
from who remembered yet that could be in
the

55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,659
could have happened weeks ago and the
defacement snow also we might really

56
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,150
have to look to all those to favor um

57
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,060
so we can we have some critics tools out
there like crap that

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,310
all can't hotel called I but

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,830
maybe you want to do something that was
more specially designed for the chop off

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,180
I'm finding a funding attacks a or
suspicious

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,470
um activity in the talks arm

62
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,819
why not using a to design for a chop

63
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,480
on because we simply have known or not
in the

64
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,220
open source field at least so what do we
have

65
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,379
use a market study of from mostly open
source

66
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,259
some stuff we have got some some really
good

67
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,810
number publication have also a

68
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,190
intrusion detection systems on that
layer and what security does a

69
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,990
really good job on BF overstep sent a
framework we have on PHP ID s for

70
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,360
PHP based other publications aunt and we
have a bunch of commercial

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,590
among the publication firewalls out
there arm

72
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,669
to Smyrna network a lever and then on
the

73
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,080
on the local level we have from kind of
many tools

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,479
um a a forum analytics and monitoring
and forensics

75
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,240
um which 10 Canberra collectively can

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,440
work on the on the log files does not
have to necessarily

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,130
but the lights are or HW stats are
designed for use for

78
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,750
for bed analytics go excesses circle
program

79
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,100
i'm for the console way up from left
blank

80
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,830
and and from P-flag switch to work on

81
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,210
any conflicts and you can really do good
analytic stare

82
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,870
go um going to detail so for certain
fields look for purists

83
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,590
um so designed for forensic spot

84
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,310
if they are not especially from fall for
web stuff so

85
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,210
what's more like out I assign any kind
of data

86
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,000
but they don't vest some special and
it's for

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,699
of up blocks um so dead yes why not

88
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,770
just combine both routes are credit to
lead is based on

89
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,370
on look data and but uses T about the
evidence from the world of web

90
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,590
application firewalls

91
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,419
um so from the only a the only to alum

92
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,970
I'm aware of this on scalp which on
which basically on

93
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,330
use the song the field 25 PHP Eid yes
them

94
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,150
um um at just to you bets against the
filters

95
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,600
and marks it as undertakers a certain
severity

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,039
this is a good start but it does not
make use of a request unless the school

97
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,740
eso is provided by Pete PIDs and so I
just a test as yesterday a simple

98
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,789
URL encoding belief the attack
undetected

99
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,250
so and that's the only two at least I'm
well from the open source word

100
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,740
so we might be a up david says
sub-crater

101
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,380
something up little bit more bounce

102
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,509
so here's a typical up look fine in to
come from not

103
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,810
on which is the use by a pitch she and
others

104
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,020
but fault as you can see here one of the
values of two

105
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,449
you accrue string permeta called pages
some somewhat different

106
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:58,180
on the rep on meaning an attack is
trying to include our password file

107
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,520
instead of a regular page so this is
just a simple example for a local file

108
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,120
inclusion

109
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,720
arm gets you so some are also you
probably of familiar with some

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,889
week and maybe a execute a hour include
even the route fall to execute the

111
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,710
commands if there were some

112
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,590
logical a programming error in the
invocation

113
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,710
a get access to the database on to trust
that scripting or

114
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,110
maybe that's come these days arm to from

115
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,910
by the overflows expert below of loss
and there's many more

116
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,970
it's just a gif you some short
understanding

117
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,210
of on but different kinds of the input a
pro detection technique

118
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:44,389
would have to be I'm capable of handling

119
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,319
so um as always there is some two
approaches

120
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,180
um which it says the country based and
UN bases

121
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,210
um what be implemented um

122
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,669
is some to him to just use PSP NDS so a
regular expression

123
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,009
based on approach um than an approach
based on

124
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,520
a statistics to lengthen their picture
distribution a call to

125
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,720
char so the text much you ok a

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,009
and then I'm missing during based
detects mature

127
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,430
I'll which is based on hidden Markov
models accordance yes

128
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,479
8mm on that's all up on you um

129
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,069
some morning from a patient outcome to
will come to

130
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:29,639
no will later see 'em what to do with
that

131
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,969
so from a set there's been

132
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,080
lot of research in the field of on
detection and prevention of

133
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,570
on the pace attacks in the past two
years arm

134
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,990
with approach is based on the contrary
it switch your back in 2000 them and

135
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,110
tough matching for were able to chat
scripts

136
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,300
are laid on more complex regular
expressions

137
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,360
where develop to cover a pro to arm

138
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,050
a a range of attacks

139
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,940
I'm so what we did is a just use PHP ID
s I'm pipe the

140
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,750
every your a field value through it um

141
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,390
so also be used to catch PIDs
conversation

142
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,570
and from the obfuscation and
normalisation process

143
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,010
and then mentions outcome against the
mmm

144
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,370
the provided about the seventy regular
expressions

145
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm which mmm try to match for for
certain kinds of attacks

146
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,560
also in the end PHP ID s purchases are
some numerical value as a result

147
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,910
are called the impact of the attacks so
we do nothing more damn

148
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,000
shelf make use of PHP Eid yes

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,120
on lock files

150
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,450
as for from some really basic statistics
on

151
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,580
there's been a some ideas like a have a
look at the lengths

152
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,709
from the long and the you have a query
string is a relative levy more

153
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,510
unusual it may be um to make more maybe

154
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,640
an attack arm also your arm

155
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,800
why characters of the 11 a better teach
its

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,480
are commonly seen within your crew
strings

157
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,200
I think strictest my PE evidence of an
attack

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,880
up fifteen approach is based on the
court's Distribution Manager

159
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,910
relative frequency of characters arm

160
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,769
within your query string well use buy
I'm very proud people out there

161
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:27,029
so what we do is who tough to use yet
the of two lengths and it has kept a

162
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,380
distribution in a very simple way

163
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,490
fall replication issue a Christian
permitted values

164
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,880
we calculate demean of the ok ruins of
lawn

165
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,620
of a numeric characters are we do this
but simply removing all digits and

166
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,269
and unique code letters and then we
compare it against

167
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,540
um commune also non of an american home

168
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,450
meaning special characters for certain
you're a querystring permit

169
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,310
are you say that's too simple probably
absolutely is his

170
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,290
I'm but it is pretty fast in sort of
love walking through dozens of regular

171
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,600
expressions and

172
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,680
generally if the variance and

173
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,160
and the moon um of from love

174
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,589
a special characters for a certain oMG a
publication are lower than

175
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,250
which is for many publications true NPF
good chances

176
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,620
a to to use a simple algorithm at least
two

177
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,010
get the cove a few um

178
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,790
sir detection module is some this
machine learning

179
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,899
this as being too %uh um

180
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,790
a few to freeze the action that in the
last decade I'm many many interesting

181
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,190
approaches we have

182
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,860
senal approach is based on bias current
estimation

183
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,279
self-organizing maps deface um people
accused

184
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,610
neural networks pay for transformations
and drums just to see if you know a few

185
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,339
up in the last year's hidden Markov
models I'm have proven to

186
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,410
gif very good results are forum

187
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,970
detecting on a texan but traffic or

188
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,010
that for traffic in general so I'm with

189
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,079
what we did this just a use approach

190
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,910
a that for some percent in 2009
implemented at

191
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,920
and arm that's why I'm test a

192
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,300
shortly I'm not going into details on
what it'll look like models

193
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,940
are up this with probably kill the young
to talk

194
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,850
us to tell me it's just a learning base
model where we are going to lengths

195
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,579
of some observations in this case the
system

196
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,709
the values like we had some on use

197
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,170
in X wiki and then it is the password
once

198
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,320
and um hope to give them some prediction

199
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,329
about in this case that the probability
of

200
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,860
from some for observation like a cute
easy password

201
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,889
um first of all the people who do is
something we have to create

202
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,490
some to Daytona I would build on a Samba
of

203
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,980
models normally five models us

204
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,420
seems to be a very good value the more
to to that

205
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,870
let's go to performs to less um if you
would do not take enough

206
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,950
models them our results are not good we
do this forever you're a creep strain

207
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,200
pair metaphor every web application

208
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,430
a tough to find bypass so ever
replication that this

209
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,740
on our server the convective I'll use

210
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,420
I'll in the retina of a dick will use to
NA and their numerical values to an end

211
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,079
up this is a to get as Rick results
because

212
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,230
to changes very often and if it changes
it gets less you sure

213
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,380
but be seeing that it takes hopefully
are not carried out by only

214
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,480
of America a characters

215
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,690
um we are we train the model so you
think the bombast a rhythm

216
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,190
and a then test um certain um

217
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,760
a value like it is the password a Sat
Nav Association using their

218
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,019
over the PR guru um so it's probably if
it's

219
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,079
a non malicious a value that

220
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,389
big cat as a ritual in the end to be a
player

221
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,940
mutia classification system arm and
South

222
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,449
take the a Tia NTT

223
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:15,600
model with the highest probability to
get less false positives and in the end

224
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,570
the best result acetyl

225
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,880
to the some totally nothing you and um
what's more and implementation at the

226
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,209
year

227
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:27,529
and um yep of

228
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:32,350
so we did some evaluation I'm be used it
rained out of our institute some

229
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,670
up sir at some tricks locks 60,000
macbeth

230
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,589
altogether 40,000 day are on income
trading has been pretty fair took by

231
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,220
some five always

232
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,240
Aki es so we are sort we think that most
of the attacks didn't even get to the

233
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,899
locks

234
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,550
which is good because be one stand a
text free almost here check free

235
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,920
training data set we need to this I'm
new

236
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,899
if possible important doctors had a it's
okay to use disarm

237
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,600
in the terms of just messing up a false
positive rate

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,680
Theft Auto in you be used some for two
real-world exploits from

239
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,980
the resources like move from or what is
called now

240
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,730
online command execution local thank you
soon

241
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,350
cross-site scripting cross-site request
for Sharia and searching a string

242
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,389
section

243
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:24,389
arm the payload spirit of place in the

244
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,470
while yourself normal web applications

245
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,399
up the only thing was beyond use HTTP
GET

246
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,220
because we simply don't see arm post
starter interlock system at most major

247
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,570
drawback up

248
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,750
who come to that later if i dont text
carried out by pulsed

249
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,940
a mostly we won't eat and normal excess
Knox

250
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,230
so I'll just a result um as you can see
the hidden Markov models

251
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,570
um to give them the best detection
results um

252
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,709
generally do also the slowest um

253
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,230
mmm it even detected 100-person from

254
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,449
of some so that the Cirrus you're a
person enter one

255
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,610
under a nexus hundred-person

256
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,050
um of the true positives but with the
with some

257
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,199
interoperable a false positive rate of
on

258
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,589
one president so you vote probably
choose the trash held

259
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:23,060
a in the upper left for a corner
somewhere to get

260
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,290
up best resorts in the end

261
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,220
their coats distribution this case was
very well

262
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,220
%ah even better than PSP NDS but this is
because of

263
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,540
that doesn't that did not contain from

264
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,730
that money the friend from a while US

265
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,910
so if the if the values are variants of
Tobias

266
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,300
it's not that big if you do not have
that many special characters normally

267
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,459
um then does not you can get

268
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,380
quick results it's also number you
fastest

269
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,889
as for PHP Eid yes um that's not just a
a rock-solid

270
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,990
um a much you to use

271
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,260
um because it's not its independent of
the training data so it

272
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,569
give them the same from result even if
it's just one request

273
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:17,209
while the statistics the meet several
values

274
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,699
the learning-based evidence to even meet

275
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,809
a you need more a training data

276
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,250
to overcome so pissed PIDs disarm

277
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,240
just a rock-solid choice

278
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,400
so on all the of those detection
algorithm some

279
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
um therefore completed and but we still
have

280
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,280
thousands of lines of a potentially
attacks on but just too much state %uh

281
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,049
still

282
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:50,059
and to less information so what we can
do is some

283
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,860
get information um about the attack on a
little bit more and

284
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,059
even more interesting maybe get
information about the effect

285
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,840
i'm for you take a weekend cooped his
activities into

286
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,030
sessions and Andrew

287
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,950
try to see if you it's been a a human
being or some

288
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,130
machine some script up can also do I
couldn't kill mapping or

289
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,510
or look up with her if it came from some

290
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,980
what that maybe because it might be
interesting I'm

291
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,720
then we can from we can try to evaluate
if

292
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,370
and an attack was successful or not
because we don't care about

293
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,530
unsuccessful attacks nominee

294
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:36,350
so we try to at the missing context here

295
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,650
well known as for session identification
no

296
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,130
with its just based on the into request
time delay and

297
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,470
change %uh from user-agent: i'm dumb

298
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,309
then after we have several sessions
weeks a random scan

299
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,740
if it's just one thing the request of
some for most

300
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,780
something you brought the do not care if
we don't have

301
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,230
especially that one or ability a on our
server

302
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,570
own talk to detect might be a bit more
dangerous because

303
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,780
somebody strung some scripts or so well

304
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,760
don't know a human attacker is probably
the most dangerous

305
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,230
some kind of attack because a it's
carried it means that

306
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,789
real human being is trying to get into
our reps ever

307
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,230
arm also it's interesting that off from

308
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,380
the flow if that people first run
automated scans and Dan

309
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,220
led a comeback as human beings and tried
to to look if

310
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,010
if a result of the scans really the

311
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,200
to mentor approving and try to I get in
line

312
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,410
um tower rooms out of the stole from
Robert detection techniques

313
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,340
I'm pretty easy but for to say its
argument echoed if this only

314
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,049
one request per se it's some random form
saying whatever

315
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,640
it's a row if the robots the doc txt
file is requested

316
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,190
tenant might be a might be a machine

317
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,539
of course the gym can do that too up if
so lawn cat pose two crests

318
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,480
I'm the same but also of course it could
be a I

319
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,840
a human with some with some the summer

320
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,309
program if the a rinse time delay I'm
for web applications

321
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,970
meaning not image yes which is
identified by the fight tenseness

322
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,940
less than one second um then we think
wealth nobody conflict at first

323
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,679
if the a total number of other
publications is correct then

324
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,840
1000 um maybe that's a mission to

325
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,309
and if the the coat of

326
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,150
from HTTP response code stirred our in
their four hundred sector like fun for

327
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,820
just some created they're not dynamic
threshold than

328
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,400
might be a mission to the custom when
you sit down and professional because we

329
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,210
think that the human being my two

330
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,860
ruin if if you always get formed for you
want click on the machine but just

331
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,650
try and try and try for publications
that that that don't exist

332
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,620
so arm next week and the get some more
information about the attack a weekend

333
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,659
do some keogh mapping this was a

334
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:13,880
was simply fails idea I'm West thought

335
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,549
it's about what's up some some local
company near a cologne

336
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,809
and I applied to the density-based

337
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:24,620
up by our algorithm and at the idea was
that

338
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,850
might be unusual if fear

339
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,929
the request doesn't come from a a
certain um

340
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,450
a hot spot of activity are its able to
totally dumb but again it's totally

341
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,059
discriminating against people

342
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,460
originating from from trees in this case
of

343
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,200
and its forget about that but it's
interesting to somehow I'm

344
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,559
no bear architects a come from on a

345
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,950
give traffic a level than what we also
can do is some

346
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,600
just at some DNS like a list information

347
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,990
um we do this by I'm requesting several
is like a barracuda central or whatever

348
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,360
socialists are made for several um

349
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,720
a kinds of from of like a

350
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
spam a so don't be no other that Pietrus
has already

351
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,169
p.m. prop up the been up the suspicious
of spending that's not too interesting

352
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,220
interesting maybe if it's part of a
botnet

353
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,260
um interesting maybe if that the attack
could use a some

354
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,039
some open the http or socks proxy is

355
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,700
was interesting um is some if the
attacks carried out by

356
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,870
the tone effort police up don't suit or
network operators

357
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,970
be out doing a great job and defending
us from prison

358
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:45,429
what all the surveillance programs are
called a what's under that

359
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:48,710
so arm for us to some just yet another

360
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,620
unsuccessful scan matter depending on
your

361
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,380
a network setup if you are connected to
the Internet

362
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,580
then probably know because you will have
to this are a couple of minutes

363
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,440
so we somehow all it would be
interesting to know if the attackers

364
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,890
succeeded

365
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,010
um so I want us to succeed mean in this
case

366
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,440
of when used to somebody find this is a
tough information disclosure like home

367
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,690
to pass a FEA the developed occasion

368
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,320
or sit down file disclosure like someday
Tyseley

369
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,549
morrissette the compromise of the server
or the

370
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,309
hacked accounts so to this kind of
depends on

371
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:34,169
on your setup and your security level

372
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:37,500
um what we now do this with South a be
tough

373
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,220
a replay via text for every single

374
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,659
request identify it as a tech we replay
it

375
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:48,059
the match for up certain signatures and

376
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,279
then a a single word that might be some
a

377
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:57,250
summer group some info on the King of
Iowa leaking

378
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,260
well let's fall deposit £5 for example
this is just the next

379
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,909
excerpt on for some sauce put five as a
private key so

380
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:11,400
we can match for um Arum shes PSP so
uptight and whatever if

381
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,610
this is important for us are some
five-part the sleek some

382
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,090
database a messages leaked on

383
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,110
yeah we can do that bus but isn't that

384
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,570
kind of teasing um in many cases did the
web server isn't up anymore

385
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,039
if it is might even even didn't change

386
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:34,120
its contents by replaying the attacks
are

387
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,159
may be blunt um to evaluate the success
of attacks

388
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,919
along with on the the logfile
information

389
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,659
as you can see their so how to disarm

390
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:52,659
as some anybody any idea

391
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,779
that's a very good idea I first I
thought about the

392
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,350
no the about the HTTP response code

393
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,240
I'm but arm that that's really not make
sense for web applications anymore

394
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm a bit from make sense for HTTP
access

395
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,980
the or something like that i'm for it
she excess

396
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,260
um about but to a6 unsuccessful looking
for replication

397
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,570
always 200 we all this just get 200 I'm

398
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,990
so we still don't know if T to see
possibilities

399
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,330
um included or not

400
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,900
so estate stuff that what we do is

401
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,270
we are we look at the bites and where
you are even though we don't know

402
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,190
the we have no access to it actual
response be do a

403
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,720
half the fields from but just some the
bites

404
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,750
sent we up okay

405
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,010
what we can do to see from St Peter's on
scouts is some

406
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,669
maybe for the fall we can at least say
Obama okay

407
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,169
they look for some a and that doesn't
exist and we can maybe

408
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,230
exclude that but become very much more
from

409
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,029
response cuts so as far and bites and
value

410
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:10,080
um week and we can look for our clients
in there in 10 say old

411
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,900
if there's not lie or den their actual
consonants response different

412
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,900
don't normally and then it might be a
interesting

413
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,049
I am problem list that we don't have to
know me up

414
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,470
alright of the static content was always
the same

415
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,169
are bites and value on then we get
something else and and we know its own

416
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,010
our clients so we often half to

417
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,140
like a in the example we have from a

418
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,970
paints a news blog in exons on that
therefore

419
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,990
alt sometime in the content so but with
so it can see there's some some hot spot

420
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,779
a in some magnitude of on

421
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,240
of value we also can might maybe have
several hot spots

422
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,039
um that's why we use a a density-based
um

423
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,830
up by Igor Adam the are look up by
effector

424
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,690
well which is pretty slow but um but OK
on

425
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,909
because we do this only a for requests
addicted as attacks

426
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:12,250
on so I'll to Silent Spring

427
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,630
experimental attempts to produce a very
high up

428
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,809
false-positive rate yup but some

429
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:23,559
but it it in the test kind of worked on
so on

430
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,659
as you can see I'm tatt password is a

431
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:30,230
2,219 bites if that is the size of

432
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,270
or a possible filed them movie I've got
a problem at all

433
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,429
onto bikini might also be a a flyer

434
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:42,070
bout whistle some trash holding you
might be able to handle this

435
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:47,510
in the end you probably have to mentally
so check it

436
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,909
I'll as such just said to

437
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:57,909
reboot

438
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:05,190
yeah I wanted to show you some

439
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,840
on some examples of the rock room

440
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:42,770
who some personal notes just ignore that
now we have

441
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:49,810
some to have a script so to take some
time for so I'm so here we go

442
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,250
I'll as we can see I'm

443
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,820
this is some some example a summary
world

444
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,250
lock file on yes I'm a time line of the
year

445
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,530
attacks up there um we r

446
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,230
have certain colors for the the impact
I'm

447
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,300
week and I may be search for a certain

448
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,030
a a strings like a passport

449
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,090
so and the

450
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,330
look a okay somebody's tried to include
but so far it's tough on for so

451
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,950
we don't we don't care we can sort by
client

452
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,010
by home by the impact um by

453
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,380
film some kinda yeah i text
classification made by PSP ideas but

454
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,900
you know that's a that's not too to
clear

455
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,690
week and we can say we only 12 Service
Co 200

456
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,470
which might be more interested because
we don't care about all that a settler

457
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,420
400 the have a records and pecan also
say

458
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,700
%uh let's just a take let's have a look
at the

459
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,950
at the attacks originating from

460
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,730
apartments off from mmm to a service and

461
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,200
people who have been no spam already

462
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,460
so things like that weekend you can sort
by the

463
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,230
requests are method up what's we also
can see in this kind of association very

464
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,460
good is so

465
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,020
were that

466
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,420
I'm for example you can very often see
I'm its a over there

467
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,700
2045 20 and so on a

468
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,600
so that song thats all new

469
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,650
wha the same stripped on which scans for
a risk assessed at sei

470
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,680
it it I would steps um ok but so you can
easily see an

471
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,220
in this map kind of with all essential
the

472
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,510
I hope it for ex bf another kind of like
go

473
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,180
more what you with gif for some

474
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,570
automatically generated report ok you
can read it

475
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,350
for example this host this remnants can
last year of

476
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,390
from I don't know where I know we don't
know because to take a coach's identity

477
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,710
up because it comes from pot plant

478
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,790
so don't even try taking a its esta

479
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:28,570
the has got some severity I don't think
that's true in this case

480
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,660
just so give me a second

481
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,930
so

482
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,010
at ISIS our um order to set aloft
institutions WEA

483
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,150
we r via included some fires of the

484
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,580
from well dusty excrement for the text
with the

485
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,720
it is the password or whatever included

486
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,810
so that the the

487
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,130
two bites and value has been set to GR
to the

488
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,930
corresponding value if the effect would
be successful and

489
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,950
a in many cases it just detected by a
some kind of

490
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,200
I'll play affect up are

491
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,730
insult good up

492
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,860
totally not cool.

493
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,340
so maybe we can look at

494
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,390
to us once

495
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:35,060
I'm that's also a real-world example
which is also interesting

496
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,970
because some we can see it some

497
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,080
I hope you can read it it's a targeted
scanned and a and the

498
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,040
nato non-human attacker um and

499
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,570
you can see with some with some the
publication severe mostly targeted

500
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,660
and she also we have some

501
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,690
some property as current section

502
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,950
a it doesn't I didn't up I didn't you
can

503
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,560
automatically say you were angered
encoding and duplication a

504
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,920
this wasn't an adult in this case of arm

505
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,020
anyways just some some example

506
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,440
up are use more from

507
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,090
for some tool called a square does P A P
PHP and

508
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,050
we don't know if if that's a legitimate
to a servant

509
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,760
yep also we can see if

510
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,850
an attack was carried carried out by day
or night

511
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,790
but just like this one so it might be
interesting if

512
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,940
in this certain time so on that the
attack was carried out

513
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,700
maybe from a a midnight to eight o'clock
because

514
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,870
then it probably was the some a current
not some

515
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,470
government guy because to rate work from
8-5

516
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,970
maybe have might be interesting okay
this is just some

517
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,130
some expert experiments with his other
facial

518
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,620
you can offer get a Tesla some CS

519
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,060
the data or it's a sin or XML

520
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,390
whatever deity and produce up

521
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,520
so from

522
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,260
yeah I think that's almost the last
night all that's just some

523
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,900
briefly discuss arm discussed um some

524
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,910
come to missus often take a2 you've ate

525
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,180
detection um for all the

526
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,480
learning based algorithms um clearly if
an attacker can write to the training

527
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,080
data and some poison

528
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,080
large porch portions of it I V F just
simply lost

529
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,550
I'm the same as for statistics arm

530
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,610
in the first case arms can make no more
requests um

531
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,810
looked like identified some attacks and

532
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,200
the other way around from so

533
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,240
from that's a real problem we need mmm

534
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,130
not taught her put her first into clean
training data about

535
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:59,150
ninety person or accused large portions
of the trend data should be on

536
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,440
should be regular from requests I'm else

537
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,280
all the only answer to space approach to
some will fail

538
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,980
so I was treated to a two count two
messages um

539
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,600
is that from we would just ruin until we
have

540
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,910
on enough examples and then stopped
ringing so what's all

541
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,800
also performs issue and be only your own
from

542
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,130
that's a 100 different IP addresses

543
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,400
I'm so that's still not perfect but

544
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,070
an attacker has 2 FXS to very many IP
addresses

545
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,640
and he has to a to poison the training
data at the very beginning

546
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,740
to from to a to make a slow texter them

547
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,760
undetected another condom issue maybe
vote

548
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,970
P a hybrid approach and just some

549
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,630
run PHP at yes to filter out large
portions and then afterwards I'm

550
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,220
run crew learning based on approach

551
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,780
what else can I take it you I'm it there
so so many ways cell phone peyot up this

552
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,410
confiscation the bat

553
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,450
like URL encoding Orem hundreds of ways
to to obfuscate

554
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,730
you need JavaScript on one condom issue
some

555
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,330
to just use some the PSP idea some
conversion

556
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,020
inching for all the texts los utiles and
then

557
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,240
are hope that the deal for skating on a

558
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,330
is so I correctly applied

559
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,440
than the latter problem with that a
think it can use Vick tourist that

560
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,800
are simply not locked or a not visible
to us

561
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,110
um this is a real problem we use it
don't have access to post data set

562
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,660
or to any parts of the hd2 body or
header

563
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,370
so on just carrying out your tech with
pills instead of getting will

564
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,250
um will simply be in effective way to to
you a time detection

565
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,150
on forensics laser and that the Apache
developers

566
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,540
don't really make it too easy to lock
posts a top

567
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,830
so group then we have found some a text
that are

568
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,170
trust I'm just not visible to the server
on because it's

569
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,550
never ever transmitted there like you
know dawn based

570
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,620
cross-site scripting

571
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,030
what also what can be done is some a

572
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,650
try to hide at the flow of the attack
the the course of events and

573
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,610
from separate steps um so slowing down
he attacked

574
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,250
from in in time our quote carrying out
from

575
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,350
and many from multiple origins I'm

576
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,060
to hype that all the steps um are part
of one and the same

577
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,770
on preaching arm on the other and we can
also create

578
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,240
just feud of nonsense attacks maybe
hundreds

579
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,430
thousands hundreds of thousands and
making the

580
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,910
detection much with trigger but then
making it difficult for them to see

581
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,260
which attack is to really attack a text
that was meant to be

582
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,020
successful because it's still difficult
to see

583
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,830
woohoo tutsi distinguish between
successful and unsuccessful attacks

584
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,130
um the on the look far based um

585
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,970
site what in taken 2 s.a to attacks
against it locking itself

586
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,130
um obviously if it's like a fruit or

587
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,280
in somehow right access to develop file
some

588
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,690
he can remove any evidence of this
behavior

589
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,220
of cleaning what you do with some we run
a simple props

590
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,370
outlay a test against the 2.5 I'm into
request I'm time delays

591
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,580
I'm so we can detect if these a nice kid

592
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,830
truncation within the locked it up um

593
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,130
but does our players can also caused by
a natural phenomena

594
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,650
normal phenomenon like up temporarily
disabled

595
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,750
doc services are networked on time so

596
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,270
run some clock changes are no company X
is a Christmas

597
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,040
so and so we you if we detect the

598
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,720
that lot but has been many politically
thats we don't gain anything of that

599
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,940
so well with store you look for us on
safe place

600
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,420
maybe a separate machine so what we also
can do is maybe a

601
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,440
denial of service dept separate machine
that to take two locks and safes them

602
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,050
so weak and somehow denial of service to
that the doc

603
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,470
server over 10 sent one by to an old
version of Apache and

604
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,530
stanfield simply stop logging up but
this is fixed here's

605
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,370
our last but not least a and take a can
do I love looting

606
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,710
by just from sending really really many

607
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,660
requests so artists are not infinite and
in the end

608
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm will at some point I'm which the end
of the disc

609
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,790
a can no longer go up and the attack was
carried a hot

610
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,410
I don't know if it's too practical about
maybe um

611
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,090
maybe in the is something to think about
I'm

612
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,970
if the if if locker tation that is based
on them five sizes

613
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,590
that and we could some carry out the
attack I'm afterwards um

614
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,710
making my much of nombre requests um

615
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,730
and then by rotation the attack might
get overwritten

616
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,740
um so maybe that's something to think
about for

617
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,170
for rent

618
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,740
so thanks for your attention to um I
hope to

619
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,900
and try to talk um of source code a

620
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,160
research so and this presentation is
some online at like it up

621
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,980
um 14 link the implementation is some
still pretty much

622
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,530
Prix of a coat a there are pics inside
their property exploitable

623
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,880
I up by specially crafted look path so

624
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,030
a maybe it's your home for two to try
this out

625
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,490
um also I have to think that's an
interesting project

626
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,650
um feel free to join or 240 just

627
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,740
talk to me later at the beer arm

628
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,610
so I think we have time for one question

629
00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:00,610
to I don't know any questions

630
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:15,150
and you for use you talk funny

631
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,079
quite interesting minute is in some

632
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,660
see someone's do PCs and

633
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,190
that's going to receive as and in some
cases

634
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,380
which it wasn't visible saddam bases

635
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,410
nice lines sees you trying to find

636
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,849
and actual successful attacks so if we
take for example ceaser

637
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:42,630
deng's on steinway

638
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,980
that you York as you call it

639
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,609
can detect season a

640
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:53,230
I'm not sure if I got a question
correctly but what's meant

641
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,650
somewhat that if on the attack is only a
click against declines

642
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,910
then if you can't see it from the server
side them know we have no chance in

643
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,880
detecting it

644
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,880
isn't that something is okie C

645
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,830
thanks for top first about back from

646
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:24,750
for company which operates my speech
freemen servers

647
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,170
about fifty customs and you can

648
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,290
meant rhythm data and we always have

649
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,700
the problem we need some for whose you

650
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,760
were this large amount of data do you
have any number

651
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,930
we yourself forms norms the

652
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,620
not too well there

653
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:52,550
um so it's a if you have got there are
hundreds of megabytes it's a %uh still

654
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,240
into

655
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,710
depending on the algorithm it can be and
some minutes but if it's more than

656
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,060
you're getting into trouble um well

657
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,450
if somebody wants to help improve the
the I word himself

658
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,130
your free it's a open source project up
I it

659
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,980
maybe use of time for dis with some
which is not

660
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,410
really sign for to chop but but you
could give it a try because it

661
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,480
verse relief options fast I'm not sure
lotsa a lot better

662
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:28,480
thanks

663
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:39,769
Sonando thank you here
