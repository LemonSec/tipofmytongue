1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,470
yet I'm going to starlight

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,180
SAR hi all

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,280
I'm Ricardo on I want to talk about the
FBI for computer security

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,320
uses some comparative saw first love all
let me say that to

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,789
his work has been known my are wanna lie
under way

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,050
on there are the media students when
internal dow I'm not so with my PhD

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,760
advice on

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
something saw

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,840
first of all let me also includes myself
I from Oz Masi di

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,809
in now very good there country spain

11
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:41,129
you know here from San I was now we have
a lot of things

12
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,460
I have to spend my time in our very is
not only in Terrell

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,820
Montelongo okay and after this is more
disclaimer

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,170
let me know continue I ma mendosa

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,030
got the nose ruby sapphire gingrich 90
minutes love their to such an

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,290
I'm were in the FPGA student at the
University of solid sound good

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,920
and accordingly and working for that any
company missed your mother read

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,780
walking all these stop made in sixteen
tons in common

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,650
she think that missus other feel on the

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,780
my PSP likewise the next morning so
costing us

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,930
that on now we are going to see some
demos in this area

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,600
talk although there have been and
development

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,810
with their GPL ever since we and I
sensed

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,310
some are a under the Indian open source
license

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,810
on each one of their licenses but if I'm

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,990
wander into one of the songs 5 on now

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,090
everything so my love also their demos
and also these lights

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,759
in the shower URL you can access from
there

29
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,280
your I'm now you're gone trust me there
is no

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,689
any other ones on their bf I think

31
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,700
saw Anna because they'll the end of the
dark

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,860
for someone to talk to read about to
what up what is

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,860
DVI ho-hos as you to log

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,080
on now menus as you can do for computer
security

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,580
then I will move to what is out the me a
framework

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,599
okay attacks on TV out of our FM was out
there we compile

37
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,849
now confining on the Internet on now

38
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,129
they're nice and the combative that
there would have to from then I was so

39
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,340
you some demo somewhat

40
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,430
how we cannot play area we can apply
sorry and DVI

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,099
to computer security mainly air for
chemo now believe this I'm fond

42
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,700
doing something find analysis on for
reversing uni

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,190
after that the focuses on the
admonitions

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,670
so moving to the business what is the VI

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,330
DVI stands for dynamic be no
instrumentation

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,180
cell the main war TR instrumentation
dynamic on binary

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,970
okay cell what these to me what is news
to me

48
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,620
so often do the things you love about
the skin

49
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,069
and instrumentation can be defined as
been able to save

50
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,769
morning to modify the behavior of a
computer program okay

51
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,230
some other guys says that
instrumentation means

52
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,900
the everyday realities of golden
minorities to collect some kind of

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,140
information so I have makes these two
definitions

54
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,170
so as to make the semifinals

55
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,459
on I some point everything RR a binary
wanna go to accept or go

56
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,459
by means of correcting some information
on audience on

57
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,470
a retard gold a during day run

58
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,430
except substantive issue means what is
happening

59
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,450
okay what about Miami we have two kinds
of

60
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,370
golden eye disease est added that means
out there we're going to an icicle

61
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,830
before execution this case we are
nineteen

62
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,129
and all the possible execution bob's of
for

63
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,730
or binary Sol he's not extremely good
for the performance

64
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,739
then the more but you have the more time
you will spend so

65
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,659
not so dynamic harmonized on our

66
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,840
during the execution in this case you
only

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,920
analyze one execution but despite me the
ban on

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,000
on a on a double date they typable them

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,150
given my day by the user so dynamic
music

70
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,320
not to we are doing a a everything doing
that's a gruesome

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,949
on about minority so we can perform

72
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:34,830
different kind of dynamic denies he's
any we have their

73
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,530
so Scott I if we have the whole cause

74
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,690
the source code for we have two choices
maybe we can

75
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,280
use two men somehow also scored by Amin
ORF

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,229
greats the compiler conduit for also my
ass

77
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,699
I if we don't have the source code is

78
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,699
moralizing como case

79
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,130
we can air we doing the binary now
starting wages means that

80
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,150
each time want to lose to me we need to
create a new binary

81
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,419
weekdays all express all weekend reading
now in the

82
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:15,630
dynamic way we can also the pain in my
own way using the Malaysian RB to our

83
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,400
over to his young or we can just maker
something

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,210
come so by ninety minutes referred to

85
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,690
day gold of a binary or on a massive
double coding

86
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,930
in this case in wins thank cell whether
they're

87
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,020
main advantages of having binary
instrumentation

88
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,250
well we r totally independent of the
primal enrich

89
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,690
of the binary nasa it doesn't matter if
it was combined with their

90
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,810
I this one basic or c plus plus a lot a
lot

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,250
we have some mushing Madras young
peacefully on a bandage or

92
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,009
at the unfunded depends if you talkin
assembly or not

93
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,979
I'm not we can teach too many any kind
of so I mean

94
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,539
Jones over or for a bit I suffer

95
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,509
that month it is of using binary system
and then some are mainly that

96
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,009
we don't need to recombine are reeling
each time they

97
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,490
binary a a loss to find their

98
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,220
on the cycle so dynamically generated go

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,509
on that we can even 33 meant a person

100
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,660
which is already in execution so using
their that that

101
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,139
okay sell hard bodies

102
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,210
DVI is not there wanna run we have

103
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,210
field this you have allergies may not be
a we ain't do seem

104
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,690
some overhead the summer haiti's is on
my resume in diesem

105
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,940
during the execution on now of these
wheeler

106
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,220
for use are very very impact the

107
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,419
behind but on the performance all these
can be a very

108
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,479
pain in the ass for the announced soco

109
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,810
cell hold us leave you walk we call that
would not say that

110
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,389
we cannot any arbitrary code during the
execution of a binary

111
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,400
so we will have here or running called
love or binary

112
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,380
and leading we need to define what to do
I want things

113
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,860
okay he's know mine i think is causing
some attention from gym

114
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,330
so we did with this thing you can define
what

115
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,610
we want reset and then we have to be
fine the places

116
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,750
okay where we want to what the school

117
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,389
cell phones that we have or mine and i
can say okay I wanted you to execute

118
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,410
this girl

119
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,590
on TV's Boyle antonini's point okay

120
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,580
so I'm from Ireland definition of
whereas there DVI in the context of

121
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,310
dynamic analysis

122
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,880
saw a DVI give us

123
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,860
annexes accepted August will make your
the total control over the execution of

124
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,830
the binary

125
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,090
on we don't need their to half active
hard to detect low support

126
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,080
okay something goes wrong with the retry
the case young

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,729
every television doesn't haha to cons on
the binary

128
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,360
within one as young it doesn't leave us

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,410
I really excited about the formation on
now

130
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,069
with a working we weenie article on
support

131
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:12,110
saw let me go and use of first

132
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,199
non-security uses of for DVI

133
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,470
mainly for the committee to metrics star
of generational

134
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,710
memory leaks that they kill mistook him
for filing

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,389
they don't have been seeing sets for
filing risk aversion to kill

136
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,280
also in computer architecture if you are
more related to the spill

137
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,570
a the VA's gonna use for

138
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,870
dinner raised in there trace for memory

139
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,740
memory traces for all making the

140
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,789
Bronson gates a I'm gutted leaders

141
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,370
so what for memory for use in recovering

142
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,940
on for humiliation of its big reasons
that are you so everything not

143
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,010
unique test own research

144
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,010
these things are using DVI okay I'm so
on so forth

145
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:04,089
seeking more security related
resuscitate that wonderful analyses

146
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:07,420
when I read if they jones's the one that
we are going to do in there

147
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,170
in the demo best case or fighting in a
ratio on

148
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,940
advance warning Dorian like their and
say we letting you in

149
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,089
or progress monitoring some looking

150
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:23,399
on everything that you can think from
here

151
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,550
so let me commend you solve the does
that already are you seeing

152
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,860
very I saw how fine just for one every
t-shirts we have for

153
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,399
sage of Microsoft societies

154
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,100
was green on I'm sure they're mine being
of ten-year-old

155
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,730
very outraged over a disease

156
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,790
okay there de veau

157
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,000
I used in computers guarantees it's
producing good to know

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,519
so we have a lot of you can check on
main tere

159
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,930
I have just input here a few also

160
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,399
person based on No related somehow to BB
I'm

161
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,600
all its not too let's move to the second
point

162
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,839
what us what does not deviate from work
well

163
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,890
andrea from what he said to all but all
your

164
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,740
gives you a bunch of folk Jonesboro API

165
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,320
42 development that does not our develop
it

166
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,640
with the same give you a friend were
arcola DVR

167
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
the a sorry the your

168
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,610
dynamic binary and she still on now we
have different types

169
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,959
it can be a life please wait or heavy
with

170
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,990
and the main difference is that they
anyways

171
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,339
use something to make going to make it
go

172
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:45,790
we would see an example later on da
mingun well as those hardy VA for war R

173
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,890
we have a core that they're usually
Justin them compiler

174
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,290
at the squeeze controlling the execution
of your binary

175
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,910
I'm going we have or ivory okay used to
think that dole

176
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,610
you where them a lot on here is where I

177
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,700
where you define what you want to East
remained are not

178
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,029
the bases where you want to instrument
okay usually

179
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,459
at the reform was calling these wat so
you will in MoBay

180
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,640
framework or then you would put their
rivalry on

181
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,600
after that day my native instrument

182
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,480
are yet the most common you smoke seen
Dvir

183
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,860
just in time where we have fun with the
big

184
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,310
a modification a very small said the
first to cast before disagreed in them

185
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,610
a in this case a these modes

186
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,899
berry is more robust on you it's very
good for a repetitive behaviors

187
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,850
points just for Ruth why is because at
this is more set of

188
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,100
is to just our story now on is to
concussion

189
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,399
so each time you say is needed

190
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,399
you hurry day mollify you need to modify
it

191
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,470
and distortion any okay know them always
a brawl

192
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,529
a in this case you are doing a memory
but %um

193
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:05,209
I this is less overhead this accused and
that is quote

194
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,240
are but for what is not supported by all
their

195
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,019
DVF remorse that are available calling

196
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,290
last 11 let me commend you that there is
defend their

197
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,760
and where it is more calls for more fine
so

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,120
we have we gone a there go to these two
kills

199
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,639
already there go to a routine so today
and image that these more

200
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,839
make okay so we have a very fine or

201
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,209
more course right

202
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,730
however %uh some was then are not
supported in now

203
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,950
some other day BB I frank's

204
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,490
some of points on so what

205
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,339
are Grenada deviate from most other we
have available on the interment

206
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,959
have yes these for name a few

207
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,420
name are known are this

208
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,450
wanna here the three of you at least for
as far as I know

209
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,589
are so we can ask okay what air from

210
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,790
if we'd big the three points that's what
is much rather

211
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,730
mom this is the question that we have
tried to once we're in this research

212
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,190
solid recommend not ascetic timber sale
why why we have

213
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,420
and selected this indeed we have
following the spare

214
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,300
grid area mainly that this so what is
being Monday need

215
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,930
act on them I bad that the Lisa

216
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,910
dealer license gives access to their
source so Scott

217
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,709
not we have it's free for use

218
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:40,000
and there is some kind of puppy to to be
able to develop some

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,230
divvying and i really am just all

220
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,130
on we have also look for I'll bet if she
said uncommon in fact

221
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,310
in order to be able to compare

222
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,459
saw we are focusing marine

223
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,880
marines' hi word on our

224
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,250
BHP decision the universe def come each
it's just call the survey level with the

225
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,769
dbl merchant license a

226
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:08,630
however by mean yet Eugene I need a
minute goal

227
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,389
in indeed the specs a year saw it here

228
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,880
broke in our heavyweight and deviates

229
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,399
on now you don't support their East
Turkey on

230
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,760
on the superb blog good money okay

231
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,389
so all the support you've got two
tickets are these ones on about the

232
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:26,540
system's

233
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,300
and line also Bradley sorry michael's
I'll also

234
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,959
on okay the other one beam is one

235
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,440
insane developed by Intel we have the
source code

236
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,500
available what however their license
preparatory I'm now

237
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,899
wonders evening of these DVI offering
worry that you follow us

238
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,329
but that a processing their during its
usual

239
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:52,709
are you can check on and then on this
website if you want

240
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,910
United I'm you can see also abdominis

241
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,339
DV I think will propose and sorry for
life

242
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,860
of the all moralist

243
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,660
all the lights okay

244
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,399
I finally 9 a real leaking

245
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,750
been developed by mith P and I think
that everything has been most by Google

246
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,230
always gone already so how are miso
Scott is also my level

247
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,320
and the baby is the to license

248
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,199
on it has every are really good the
condition

249
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,730
on the whole lot and nothin bubble

250
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,740
doesn't use all their and rallied and
writings

251
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,220
knocking so yes we're going to some
similarities

252
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,529
between them are

253
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,029
we gonna been get it goes not to we
cannot do or

254
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:49,410
minorities and has to be donning CRC
plus plus

255
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,259
we don't need to to have the subs gotta
love the binaries to be implemented

256
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:58,320
on all other than our last the to
execute the name

257
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,459
Linux saw

258
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,240
let me commend you what we have done for
the comparative

259
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,880
we have developed a tool that it's very
knife

260
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,949
Sally Dhoni owns the number of
instructions about

261
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:16,060
are going to be executed but there we
haven't used

262
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,810
to run right its main restrictions on
the basic blocks

263
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,290
30 busy finding that stuff assassinate
as more setup instructions

264
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,399
sorry million for instance nice him
there until a job or

265
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,250
or accountant fees will be a make

266
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,570
the main comparative have been to
evaluate the performance of the selected

267
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,949
give me a friend was commended anything
and we have a defined as low as well

268
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,190
I was there a deal between diamond

269
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,519
up in Eastham indeed air on the

270
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,810
the time not being instrument located
I'm not takes

271
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,930
in a solution so yes from Torrington now

272
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,170
why we were developing these we have

273
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,320
diving to the air folks yourself each
one of these

274
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,919
you be from worse I'm just becoming the
not to

275
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,449
being house very good examples by mario
has been able to command a sham

276
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,530
I'm borrowing okays the loser here

277
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,990
at is not about 20

278
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,730
ice cream and other things I'm not going
to enter but there we have used the cell

279
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,689
my team's so there with this company
will issue I'm

280
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,490
are yet as benchmark

281
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,510
we can see that do to you some other
come on make smartphones and

282
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,789
aspect but they are expecting a was
discarded because suspect you have to

283
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,070
pay for you see

284
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,750
saw we develop or own benchmark by

285
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,400
a taking some of the rare

286
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,059
on the binaries at are using this as
that benchmark

287
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,740
on there mainly we have defined in a
range by different categories

288
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,500
so we're interested in a mine eyes open
to competition from

289
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,760
computation not done I know is that make
em

290
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,549
hi use of air into adulthood on the use
of memory

291
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,690
okay so this is their

292
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,890
results of their comparative so sorry
for them

293
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,470
but the resolutions but is also an
expensive because I don't have their

294
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,490
material rough so i cant saying it cell

295
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,660
let me commend you that to here we have
%ah

296
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,780
the memory confirmations in now megabyte
in making megabits

297
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,919
okay here we have all the miners out
there iron ore

298
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,270
benchmark some other than cell that's
for sewing not

299
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,970
a here we have my confirmation of

300
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,350
than a real okay on here we have the

301
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,910
namely confirmation of marine for each
one of the binaries

302
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,120
also here we have the being on of course

303
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,120
here we have day execution without

304
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,160
instrumentation up I suspect it is

305
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,690
what is a festival offering

306
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,039
this modest in size of memory saw a

307
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,120
about Islam maestro invasions comparing
that to offer

308
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
on the right is that we have gone see
their we can see a very

309
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,390
and I've read hi difference between the
range max

310
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,710
us are in between the deviation with
okay cell

311
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,169
here we have not a we have

312
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,360
tested all the binaries and use enough
to meet issue on on

313
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,730
are letting you know she'll or at our
level of division of three

314
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,910
so you we can check back to we have here

315
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,490
a very high as long run for my room

316
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,120
on also in the case of coming down now
and the higher

317
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,710
optimization in the they are more or
less the same okay

318
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,600
saw as companies in a vehicle body let
me tell you that

319
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,179
a half if you want to run out the
magical device called or

320
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,400
a Miami that I do we not have a higher
complication in weeding terror plot

321
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,830
usually use by a real there's no one
solution we have seen that is borrowing

322
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,429
on the view our you have some memory
posturings

323
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:12,020
may be used to use air being instead of
using dino Morea

324
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,690
okay some funny things that we have
discovered during the zoo sex

325
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,309
is that deny me through Youngs using
that maybe they should be the same

326
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,309
so you have the same I know you're
counting those instructions there's a

327
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:25,650
reason right

328
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,070
well not to is not I you know everything
to use the fares

329
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,360
ammonia is one of the ADB phone words
and these

330
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,770
is because ito each one of these the
fillers

331
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,990
s top stories to meant in a in a
different point

332
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,409
okay we also detected Abu in the

333
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,620
in Bahrain related to the when

334
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,789
a function that Iran saying a ATV

335
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,390
numbers seem to in Bossier architectures

336
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,480
but they're unfortunately it was a
really important so we cannot

337
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,380
with their signup anyway

338
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,450
and let me say that if you are
interested in these there's something

339
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,380
a report my student that is this one

340
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,320
I'm sorry to say that isn't funny we
should write some

341
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,630
paper on these so on

342
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,210
but I dunno okay anyway I you can use

343
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,850
good right or left ask me okay

344
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,299
so you can download it from here

345
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:32,090
are while let me go to the important
thing

346
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,669
let's go to a party there to apply and
dynamic managed to mediation to computer

347
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:38,120
security

348
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,200
saw let me comment that I have you spin

349
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,590
are beanies composed by a set of

350
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,030
ID's the setup thing I have yup so we
have to be to a machine

351
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,070
are called got on also the 8 what he
called a

352
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,970
up instrumentation okay all the tools
that are developed at

353
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,070
we did being our core Pinto

354
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,890
it's very easy I'm not uncommon how does
it work

355
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,500
okay first we have to be too much in
that is composed by the

356
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,530
just in time compiler

357
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,190
on what is your on a monitor on arms but
0k cell

358
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,419
person not to they're all just in time

359
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,240
combining dozens take your minority
combining

360
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,890
on at the summit is shown the that you
have defied

361
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,010
then the Sturgis are sent to them

362
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,360
knees but they're not on as on our store
in in the cold

363
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,850
agrees butter already execute this and
everything

364
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,500
so as I was saying before a as these

365
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,860
our stories in their got got you have

366
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,480
some looks or something like that so you
have a really good coldest amended so

367
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,250
you are not losing more timing

368
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,950
is to maintaining I'm not uncommon thing
if you want to know that these works in

369
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,799
their bed if

370
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,080
insist on 11 so yeah sorry is working
the use in space let

371
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,380
okay so not in

372
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,980
of Sonic some believe me come in there
one of their

373
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,380
examples out there for a lot it's friday
we've been

374
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,780
this a just counting the number of the
student that are going to be executed

375
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,380
saw manger main of to becoming of the

376

then you only have to but

378
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,520
a to call today is to make this your
foot in that you want to define

379
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,990
news case they are defining armies in

380
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,620

okay we check their the website sound

397
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,159
basically if you got a free lies with
the same their

398
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,380
I am memory address you can Coro de
Maria

399
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,390
okay on the stand provokes as is safe
here

400
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,900
nobody free memory may result in a right
right what where

401
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,490
condition I went out to get rescued
summer but I got

402
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,789
okay so might do what he's going to do

403

I'm going to a.m. to hook

404
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:08,890
there from don't have windows other
related to the asking of memory on da

405
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,309
their relation Sorry Day allocation of
memory and

406
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:16,130
their release for me okay cell

407
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,860

their

411
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,409
the address of the memory that they have
fair

00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,429
not in the system has provided me you
know least

413

Wellington to remove not address from
the lease

415

428
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,540
all these things as I was saying his
okay I few the code if you want to check

429
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,230
after

430
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,310

gonna be the well is just doing to
freeze and

438
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,940
to cause to religion the memory with the
same address okay

439
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,380
on my do has injected that it seem that
we've got a free

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,360
often are located on this okay so
antisocial reporting about where this

441
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,850
house

442

okay a blessing pointer cell

450
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,530
let's move to the next you have some
questions or something

451

Nexus I half a

454
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,890
focus now in the before an atypical
buffer overflow

if I need to weed is number okay so are
you know that the

456
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,460
we r copia we are coping buffer squeeze
out to

457
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,580
taking into account the limits we gotta
have some I read article execution

458
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,310
you know that right saw buffer overflows
often can be used to execute every day

459
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,370
called her a lot

460
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:57,030

512
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,240

513
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,280
the stool I'm we can try to protect
somehow

514
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,640
are there it on others to to avoid

515
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,120
yeah there the buffer explanation okay

516
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,640
so we are going now to do our I'm left
to which is gonna protect

517
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,750
ret address and DVI on that he the said
dole is going to

518
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,780
what is going to do is every call before

519
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,100
or every read our a before

520
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,240
in a Dec six young are going to be
something to eat okay

521
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,760
I what every what I'm going to do is
each time I

522
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,179
and want to find a call I will I will
restore

523
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:59,730
their legitimate read another race can
be computed

524
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,800
with these former on each time i phone I
went on

525
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,230
I would take if their druthers check and
might just

526
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,480
with the one that's in the least okay
while funny thing is

527
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,450
you will see is that that we have
detected 6 we don't think he's

528
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,860
in this library okay so by default by
Windows

529
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,860
funny thing and show you

530

DVI and war is them writing everything
in a log file

537
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,669
not the school buffer overflow dot

538
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:13,419
alt so if we check

539
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:18,419

saw with this trace you will be able to
know ways your

597
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,940
wager that data going on okay

598
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,109
saw before continuing

599
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,450
well as one

600
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,820
is related to

601
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,990
yeah to their I reverse engineering

602
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,310
a very nice example just for so many saw
I have to love at all
