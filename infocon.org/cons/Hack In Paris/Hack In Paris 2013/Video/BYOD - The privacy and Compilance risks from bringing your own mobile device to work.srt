non-technical understand

36
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:51,760
what the risks really are all

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,170
plan now we all know

38
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,519
that these devices were made for
consumers they were made for

39
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,610
Angry Birds full

40
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,489
all do they have great facility

41
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,610
we can use them for many many things and
suddenly

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,090
everybody wants to bring work

43
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,980
amused there's not

44
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,099
many call watchers

45
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:29,110
cured that

46
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,970
or wrong rest these folks are not
understanding

47
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,340
now in the US he said in Canada

48
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,290
aren't is why

49
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,939
policy you'll word

50
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:53,739
there is any more they all want their
fancy little devices

51
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,079
and that's fine and dandy however

52
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,780
what is being from organization

53
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,409

gray hair like me

54
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:10,390

eighties when we brought

55
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,950
PCs into the office and

56
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,269
said

57
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,400

all 8 that you're supposed to be
protecting

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,760
so in the last fifteen years

85
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,470
with fraud

86
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,710

87
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:36,900

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,080
securities help information

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,640

91
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,520
however

92
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,670
all did you

93
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,200
network don't know

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,920
good wop

95
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,040

nap measure and control

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,990
your mobile devices very well

98
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,990
now was that a handoff

99
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,000
up

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,350
man the do so

101
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,460
or to make were control

102
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,010
day so when I risk factor

103
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,750
of BYOD we have to begin with a very
fundamental promise

104
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,120
he are

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,970
fundamentally different then what we
have been using with PCs

106
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,090
and throughout the conference there's
going to be several

107
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,500
talks on all because mobile

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,590
is for said

109
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,020
by head

110
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,190
you want

111
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,410
maybe twenty billion these devices

112
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,630
and you will have your Google car

113
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,570
you will sit there reading a book while
the car is driving itself

114
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,720
the car then we'll say to you

115
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,640

a great job of convincing

134
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,060

who helped build compliance

173
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,770
regulations and that's why some other
more

174

not so good and they have guide

175
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,420
for what we're doing and what we're
trying to protect and protect the data

176
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,280
so that the company does not get sued
and it's not violation

177
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,380
laws laws US law

178
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,490
so now if a company has deployed

179
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,589
rack

180
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,810
an

181
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,209
whose

182
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,700
your or is it

183
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,839
the risk people who did not properly
looked

184
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,530
at implementing technology

185
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,000
and network no

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,480
word

187
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,920
the problems you have with these devices
to very fundamental things the operating

188
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,070
system

189
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,610
is a single user of

190
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,910
hood

191
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,079
roles good

192
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:03,820
all user

193
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,050
med

194
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,190
and yeah his all please secure

195
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,470
as the operating system it

196
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,720
if you have an operating system that
cannot be secured

197
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,300
how to use them for security

198
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:28,300
yep

199
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,820
you his to

200
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,550
because what up

201
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,740
your ActiveX remote

202
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,620
work work

203
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,060
the risk factor is much higher

204
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,300
now the other aspect of her

205
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,040
good

206
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,959
is these devices course mall

world

214
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,180
we have a second layer riskier

that we do not have with our fixed
computers that are fixed

216
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,050

11 measuring rest in deploying

247
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,300
why day

248
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,100
reason his because they're looking for
the

249
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,440
we all know easy answer tends to not be
the secure

250
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,240
answer now but other solution

251
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,309
law comp

252
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:29,160
or sandbox how many really likes
embarked

253
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,230
got a couple hands here are sir down
here

254
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:39,230
good

255
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,320
sewed

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,130

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,440
good

258
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,590
you off yet

259
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,200
okay technologies the first container
that has been broken

260
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,200
and the reason is it is not paid
difficult to crack

261
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,520
good

262
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,570
we go back school

263
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,940
if we know that the technology a
fundamental technology like

264
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,280
containerization virtualization

265
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,280
can crack

266
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,040
rid yet

267
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,740
uses technology no bro

268
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,760
holes who'll

269
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,400
for your company just some

270
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,440
yad have with container is Asian
sandboxing

271
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,179
people wont the original reason to bring
your own device

272
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,610
wide users word

273
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,660
I or make molded

274
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,770
all

275
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,500
you raised

276
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,030
used no

277
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,080
way that

278
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,080
you heard

279
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,530
okay fair enough

280
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,730
people by and want to use these devices
because if the user experience

281
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,000
yet when you called his age

282
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,160
what you now

283
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,740
of Bros we all up

284
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,740
rule Europe

285
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,370
never so companies

286
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,780
building virtualized environment are
changing

287
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,520
the user experience with the browser
with the email

288
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,520
why with all

289
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,640
one you

290
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,140
unknown browsers built by a non browser
company

291
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,300
email clients built by non

292
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,880
or

293
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,200
be or and this is

294
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,630
risk factor that we are seeing in
addition

295
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,870
to all of the other issues

296
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,420
so we've got 25 whose

297
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,830
about and yeah

298
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,360
mall user container is Asian

299
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,710
has already been cracked in one leading
vendor and more gonna comment

300
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,540
wire more gonna come because we head

301
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,090
do we great technology or

302
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,150
up an more

303
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,720
or said

304
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,460
up bed

305
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,160
she's so with all of these risk factors

306
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,179
I ask myself and I asked me my clients

307
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,010
why are you doing this

308
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:52,010
good

309
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,340
up

310
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,090
wipe

311
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,230
much and

312
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,260
to use stop using MDM or use much better
technologies

313
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,340
once you commit a

314
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:21,340
yep

315
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,460
here more than

316
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:35,460
longer hood

317
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,059
over and a make

318
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:44,740
tango and started deploying it
internally

319
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,380
the cost factor for doing

320
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,510
by: by

321
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,520
is between you or work

322
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,670
used you there

323

work

325
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,320
work was a of

326
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,190
now risk analysis people are always good

327
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,850
cost that

328
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,230
of

329
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,610
yes national security incident

330
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,140
right now like it 200 24

331
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:38,140
more to use a port

332
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,620
would

333
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:50,030
back he's

334
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,460
and yes was the lawyers bombing lawyers
are coming

335
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,660
so what does

here wide berries or company devices

375

377
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,660
you Europe were

378
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,990
for now a lawsuit in the United States

379
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,990
shows a another level up with

380
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,760
up

381
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,070
for holy or to use

their own personal devices for a BYOD
program

383
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,570
a few weeks ago Chicago only

384
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,370

385
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,820
up

386
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:21,820
not law

387
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,590
Road

388
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,030
here BYU

389
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,530
most of the time in night

390
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,900
right and how he

391
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,040
expected to be available that

392
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,490
vice almost any type

393
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,540
him

394
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:53,540
over

395
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,460
law bone unifier

396
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,590
so we've not technical risks we have
social risks

397
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,490
we have compliance

398
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,940
hood

399
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,610
you he said all

400
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,560
tried to use it and we no

401
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,260
we know that it's gonna be a failure
because there are very few

402
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,550
Mobile Security s

403
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,420
Nigro to chart if I can get this to work

408
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960

409
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,540
well we did is came up with HR looking
at

410
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,490
want factor stand

411
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,850
I'll

412
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,760
so week pools

413
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,050
year

414
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,370
up and on for we saw

415
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,990
up

416
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,630
risk numbers up there there's a complete
chart

417
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,630
above all the various levels above risk
that also comes with this

418
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,700
solid

419
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,940
discuss many love risk that we see you
there

420
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,390
but there's virtually from our
standpoint from a security standpoint

421
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,000
there is very very little

422
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,960
and now that it is cracked and the end
of this cough words

423
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,440
up

424
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,490
up

425
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,840
and the problem container is Asian of
course is that

426
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,430
it has been cracked it will continue to
be cracked and all the other

427
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,160
risks is that are associated

428
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,720
so for news there

429
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,840
mall lines security management

430
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,230
and I have to look at what are we doing
inside

431
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,750
years ok all

432
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,440
to make security reasonably good

433
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,440
inside the enterprise not

434
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,870
the yes

435
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,890
who work on the multi-user

436
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:54,010
PC laptop solvers server-based

437
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:59,000
world all we have something else that we
do not have to worry about in the

438
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,300
enterprise

439
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,960
and this additional risk is we never
really know

440
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,640
or good

441
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,170
of are relief

442
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,350
so go users him

443
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,140
have a clue and under stay

444
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,410
is now rest yep

445
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,960
if I have a container and my container
says

446
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,970
I HWE over

447
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,050
for

448
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,710
world what about users

449
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,570
side the device is there any side

450
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,470
all

451
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,910
all his

452
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,480
no encryption nope VPN everything

453
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,480
them hood

454
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,829
users us

455
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:16,720
so what point are they gonna make a
mistake

456
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,869
said company

457
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,230
over the personal side

458
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,000
%um

459
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
or the for

460
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:38,099
head

461
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,250
going back for because

462
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,730
unit in MBM you you have 0 up

463
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,030
protection whatsoever and

464
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,240
where

465
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,399
you

466
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,369
to which means that unless your users

467
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:05,329
mark bluetooth is always on

468
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:12,329
if they turn it off and they can't

469
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,410
year would

470
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,569
all on

471
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:24,410
work things were going another

472
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,510
my here of risk

473
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:33,240
so or midday get written some others
would

474
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,130
their yep

475
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,319
said

476
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:48,319
here

477
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,589
mode

478
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:57,569
there think about blackberry

479
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:00,630
all traffic by

480
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,300
would user

481
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,730
not turn law

482
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:15,410
whether wide where

483
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,650
0

484
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,710
at part

485
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,780
up okay

486
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,470
you could administer some levels of
group control

487
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,220
policy across your BlackBerry population

488
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,089
how do you do that today using an

489
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:46,089
good

490
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,160
so when Wik showed

491
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,780
there are various levels of technologies
that are available

492
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,040
that can had at least the VPN maybe
protect all

493
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,560
me ball

494
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,190
good the

495
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,400
would

496
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,010
to work period correctly

497
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,490
was all manage and control

498
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,240
in that flout now this club thing
corporate cloud

499
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,020
so administrators have all

500
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,410
how many your ride law

501
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,599
Road

502
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,630
we that was

503
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,660
acceptable

504
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,280
med yup great

505
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,290
back in 2000

506
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,859
when blackberries and Paul

507
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:05,160
was one of the first things heard

508
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,660
walk is Res

509
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:16,109
good

510
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:23,109
work up

511
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:29,109
across a mobile device in possible level
of control

512
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:33,700
that the user word

513
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,800
load

514
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,530
rip

515
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,630
your

516
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,800
say well

517
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,040
would having

518
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,990
Don a hard risk analysis looking at

519
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,630
the technology looking at the Paul

520
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,910
use involved

521
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,200
and security of mu

522
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,670
user he user

523
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,660
the up

524
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,510
yep

525
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,819
of user have

526
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:28,270
hold all up device electronic

527
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,510
and physically we have lost all

528
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,300
control and from my standpoint looking
at it from a wrist level

529
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,640
this is totally unacceptable

530
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,970
sup all good

531
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:51,390
an he

532
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,809
which now because it is going to be open
source

533
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,490
will obviously increase the risk

534
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,300
good

535
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,809
up

536
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:11,010
would see

537
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,880
