1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,870
alright on welcome back everyone

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,710
arm just introduce myself for a quick my
name is Mario I'm researcher and opposed

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,639
to get the rule University bottom

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,620
I rode love my PhD thesis on the topic
of clients at security and defence

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,190
mainly JavaScript and the dawn

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,980
ions what interest Justin firm we do
consulting work sucks trannys

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,369
and death I wrote some books with some
papers

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,330
are publish some tools and sometimes
they treat and if you want to drop me a

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,710
line and just let me email

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,700
arm my personal research research
focuses mainly

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,530
everything that is inside better than a
greater than so I like the program with

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,920
a shemale even the old

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,230
variations age Mo 2.0 3.0 and so on like
to play with it Smith 5

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,399
in the upcoming if your channel 5.1 arm
a javascript and I J script would use

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,670
fundamentally different from JavaScript
like BBS Visual Basic Script who knows

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,129
maybe especial Basic Script

17
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,660
who knows that are you still supports it
is like a scripting language in the

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,100
browser

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,590
X and it's great right I love it um I
like to play with plugins with controls

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,360
and to the rich text and specific skill
collector graphics month amid everything

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,320
that is going on XML XHTML ish

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,720
and can be displayed by brosser arm what
I really come true because my brain

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
feels more as binary stuff so

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,820
I can crush a softer but I can move on
from there just

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,700
not capable to do so wasn't my focus is
actually offensive resurgence action

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,509
scenarios at 254 month personal insists
I'll

27
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,700
and would really gets me going is like
this of legacy things like also features

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,320
the existing the browser's

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,759
almost not documented anymore but then
at some point to find him stumble upon

30
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,670
them you discovered that this team work
and then you can view of some stuff for

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,970
them

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,990
I really love that on doing a bit of
Defense

33
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,329
research as well that's the best hitters
WF idea systems

34
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:48,149
on look at issues P which we heard of
this morning arm

35
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,520
was once creating a good on-base access
peter that didn't work and

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,509
on I'm kind of right now working on a
project that involved on policies to do

37
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,619
with more trust

38
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,740
in the Dons them object model arm

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,219
know you my taxes have since the stock
is going to be about HTML

40
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,360
and why you know the talk about gmail
and why no talk about cross-site

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,550
scripting because they have been plenty
in the past

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,080
um in my opinion there's one simple
reason: HML

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,090
is on its way to absolute ultimate power
some everything is gonna use HTML web

44
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,670
sites

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,680
replications of course on his head
messengers are using HTML rendering

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,129
engines email clients show HTML

47
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,340
tension emails looking documentation for
your favorite tools and test cases are

48
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,370
written in HTML

49
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,000
we've router interfaces coffee machine
you eyes that are written in HTML or

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,010
displaying HTML we have medical devices
according to the source that are

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,370
actually capable of being

52
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,950
maintain fire went back and slept
pacemakers it has like a national back

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,319
and

54
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,760
for update ability I hope the address
resolves the respect for medical

55
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,160
medical device going to TVA totally
flexible and field upgradeable via

56
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,019
Pinterest

57
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,430
what the hell but anyway so

58
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,459
a gmail is around on we chil working and
operating systems

59
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,340
arm and you can basically say that the
HTML class

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,840
the dawn plus JavaScript is like a very
very powerful tool kit and we're going

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,900
to seed in the future

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,720
a lot under some days ago I saw
presentation from the w3c

63
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,980
where the inventor of HDPE Dave Raggett
was actually

64
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,129
announcing that they plan to bring html5
to the car

65
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,340
so I mean it's good to get rid of Java
in the car but if the shoe repairs with

66
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,680
him on an entirely sure

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,239
and if you have a look at gmail gmail is
huge arm

68
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,370
some time ago precisely on the 27th of
January this year

69
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,470
I just had to have a look at how much
JavaScript gmail is actually using

70
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,230
and I measured in a little bit home from
opening that unification opening a

71
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,049
single male

72
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,129
there was they can't mount a 3.5
megabytes of JavaScript mike wants to be

73
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,269
back that's like this

74
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,310
the 3.5 megabytes of compressed
JavaScript

75
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,670
that is not small website anymore just
like you using powerful operation system

76
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,560
like application

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,120
talking about and this is capable
fictional and JavaScript anthem

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,879
arm there's a lot of research that has
been going to defense like

79
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,069
how to defend against injection is
scripting attacks and two there's a lot

80
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,200
of layers that actually exists because
of that we have met with fenced

81
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,000
defense lawyers have my DS systems IPS
stripey assistance web application

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,540
firewalls that never works

83
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,350
we have four several server-side defense
lawyers and we have not security and

84
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,100
other tools

85
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,419
on with client-side defense lawyers like
The Exorcist return I E

86
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,160
on the SS tutor in WebKit drove in
Safari

87
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,690
ennui CCSP we see no script is a Firefox
extension that was to protect the user

88
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,340
and one experience that we made in the
past was basically we had a look at this

89
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,699
we bypass that they fix that we had a
look at this they pass it they fix it

90
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:37,419
and so on

91
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,680
so there is no silver bullet yet home
there's

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,729
a lot of documentation on know how to
defend properly against XSS attacks

93
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,199
sometimes good sometimes not so good as
hundreds of paper stocks book does

94
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,000
whatever so

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,530
I would say the three Forsman upcoming
quite well by myself

96
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,290
who are the three quarters in well get
to the biblical here

97
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,330
arm I discovered that good for you
Horsemen of the Apocalypse kind of

98
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,220
resemble

99
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,949
X this ass for the three kinds of excess
the jury's been talked about

100
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,870
we've reflected XSS make the very simple
thing the pure thing that comes in by

101
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,919
the URL

102
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,650
or something else in this be reflected
on the website and then execute

103
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,449
JavaScript

104
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,970
easy to understand easy to prevent slick
purity

105
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,430
and we have stored XSS which is a bit
more evil like the Red Horse

106
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,789
safe awards harder to detect hard to
defend against me the complex future

107
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,009
that is making sure that only

108
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:28,539
good original can go through in the bed
which mail goes out

109
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,139
and then finally we have the black horse
which is Dominics assess disease because

110
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,880
it's extremely hard to defend against in
the only effective protection against on

111
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,650
Nexus S

112
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,710
is not to have Tom excess so

113
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,789
but what is the proper apocalypse
without the actual fourth horseman

114
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,080
and we are today gonna talk about the
fourth horseman

115
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,150
the papers and the well enough with the
pitch

116
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,919
it's simply a technical um

117
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,160
to talk about s and about a possible new
way of accessing web applications and

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,169
other things

119
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,000
we first need to learn about the
assumptions that are behind these

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,490
attacks

121
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,740
in behind the defence so the presumption
is that perfect to access the White

122
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,539
Horse

123
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,550
it comes by URL parameters up by opposed
no sometimes I cookie

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,639
and we can detect this and we can filter
properly

125
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,009
and then refined we present the Nexus S
that comes in via postal by a file or

126
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:19,850
similar

127
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,580
ways and we can kind of separate the
good country from the best content if

128
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,039
you wanna low external

129
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
arm we can kinda filter it properly and
we're going to be fine

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,100
and then we have da mix is an ass that
comes from Don properties

131
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,470
on some of them are seeing some of them
are sources and if they play along

132
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,199
together in the European influence them

133
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,610
properly and the code is bad then we
have a Nexus S so

134
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,020
everything we have to do is just like
make sure that the scenes the sources

135
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,400
are detected are known

136
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,160
the code is good in that no don't just
happens with a bit nasty but we can

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,449
still fix it by just

138
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,750
making sure that the code is and the

139
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,319
if you believe the three some chance if
you follow the derived rules from the

140
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,400
city some tunes and we

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,220
if for eggs and ham le Clos properly and
set some security hundreds right for web

142
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,210
applications

143
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,430
we can effectively mitigate XSS so it is
possible to go ahead and said okay I

144
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,560
create an application that is complex

145
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,060
and that has like a lot of which text
but it can be free of excess that's

146
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,099
possible right

147
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,440
which we should believes well there's
one hard thing

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,250
and the hurting relates to process the
Nexus S into the necessity of having

149
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,720
complex sitters

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,849
home that is the telling apart like the
telling a part of the good marker from

151
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,460
the best part of the whole Camino

152
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,319
what is harmless and how can we know
what does not arms and can be used in a

153
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,949
negative context

154
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:36,250
on with things we don't have to know
because we have to transfer to libraries

155
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,000
we have like the a West and take Sammy
project that is a good X is a sitter

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,389
on we feel Worth Texas a suit a project
that is even better

157
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,150
we have the intimate purifier for PHP
applications that is pretty damn good

158
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,629
with a fetch me for my purse of James to
which you should use because is due to

159
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,440
crappy

160
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,389
arm there's many others are there K says
and so on edge in a lot of free throws

161
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,710
should not be used

162
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,840
and their use them but mainers and
content management systems and social

163
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,990
networks ephedra

164
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,270
that basically everywhere we see them in
the Internet in the extra night in the

165
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,610
WWW innocent for two with mail clients

166
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,050
and they are effectively the major
gateway between fancy user generated

167
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,650
text on your website

168
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,940
and persistence is this if they don't
work anymore

169
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,250
if there is like a global bypassed in
these libraries and we have a problem

170
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,430
that should breaks

171
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,750
so now the question is we know that
they're good

172
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,930
we know that there are thoroughly test
and we want to think about

173
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,509
how can we find a way as attackers to
still get around

174
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,269
the limitations that we have base in
this complex external factors can be

175
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,240
bypassed them without you can actually
bypassing them can we treat them can we

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,140
fool them

177
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,880
and can be fined little helper in the
whole stack of displaying a website

178
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,039
aids us to do so anther well

179
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,360
weekend but its offers the convenience

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,570
I'll this lady has it all she is like
the perfect kitchen the perfect often

181
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,220
somewhat computer from some company with
Ruth she was like it's so funny she's

182
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,610
happy everything is perfect life she has
convenient sexy doesn't have to worry

183
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,230
about things like things are happy

184
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,269
and this is okay people like convenience

185
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,209
and developers like convenience and
vendors like a mean is I like

186
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,320
convenience

187
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,260
and some decades ago Microsoft it's very
convenient on property

188
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,370
to the very fresh storm back then on it
started to become available in internet

189
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,470
explorer four so it has been added quite
some time ago

190
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,230
and it allowed us to manipulate the bomb
without even manipulating the DOM

191
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,880
and have the browser do the dirty work
very very very pro useful

192
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,200
and the property was called in your HTML
so it allowed us to get direct access to

193
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,700
the HTML content of a DOM element in our
website

194
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,730
retractable so we could be all the
original and you can set

195
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,810
new HTML and would immediately display
and that's it

196
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,860
and all the nasty stuff that is
necessary was being done with the bros

197
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,720
internally so it was extremely
convenient especially if you compare it

198
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,830
to the old way

199
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,990
so a few you see the bomb weighing just
things

200
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,880
green iDEN get an element and then pick
another element create an element put it

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,810
in the repentance on that nobody wants
to do that

202
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,630
you know HTML way the convenient ways
just like ribs element

203
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,810
change the enraged email and be done
with it services were going to the

204
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,500
system's

205
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,529
well the whole thing is easy

206
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,779
its Hosni months even faster than the
classical dung-wei so there's benchmarks

207
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,550
proving that the original X is actually
super fast

208
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,740
it's me by the standard with the talk
about this later and it just works

209
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,720
and it's even got a bigger brother which
is good aldrich similar thing I don't

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,570
have to explain what this does

211
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,820
arm that's in contrast to the beach with
tables because he was our special

212
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,350
especially initial email

213
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,670
um it's no one or two roses but nobody
should use was any weed

214
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,610
it doesn't really work in the world XML
because external doesn't expose this

215
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,070
kind of property at least it shouldn't
sometimes it does

216
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,120
and it's of course not it's true Israel
domination

217
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,640
from meanwhile you implemented in
everything a brother

218
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,959
I don't even have to say my because it
has been that way for ages because the

219
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:50,890
other brothers

220
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,950
brother business realize that its
non-standard not in the specs

221
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,630
but it's just such an awesome property
that that you said it's just we don't

222
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,680
the functionality and as well

223
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,329
so we can use it because fast it's easy
and it's everywhere

224
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,510
paint people are actually using it will
be critically some numbers and trying to

225
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,570
find out who's actually using an
original and their applications

226
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,630
and back then the Google search was
still around

227
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,430
I really miss it arm and I ask who could
search a Google search how many projects

228
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,649
are actually using innerHTML aldrich in
no and Google search said 184,000

229
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,230
projects not files price that's a lot

230
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,630
and enhance the lonely invoked get up
surgeons like a good upsurge home when

231
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,079
you get a project some making use of
your HTML of original

232
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:38,920
and get obsessed with 1.2 million
support that's a lot and

233
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,490
I want to find out how many real-life
website actually use this and rotors

234
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,029
model except in Cape are so

235
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,899
a crawl across the stuff and had a look
at the next pages and JavaScript in the

236
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,029
index pages

237
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,220
and it turns out that even just on index
page

238
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,279
without any laughin seventy-five percent
of its issues in which to know

239
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,829
so people do use unit/units actually
quite good

240
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,950
own one class or so for that its kind of
mortis existing because it is convenient

241
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,899
way to use

242
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,399
not to influence element content I rich
text editors

243
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,269
like complex monsters nobody wants to
have them on their server on the website

244
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,870
but sometimes we need them

245
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,769
and without your HTML creating rich text
editor would be Justin

246
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,389
major pain but not quite easy to accept
so

247
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,350
and even though you're ever gonna go
into management systems with Nicholas

248
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,589
inclines publishing tools we can see
rich

249
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,600
Exeter's about everywhere arm

250
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,839
I we'll ask ourselves what is the actual
problem with that so we have an awesome

251
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,459
property

252
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:37,779
and saw some properties awesome unused
when using right now owning

253
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,160
communism original but there's going to
be a problem that right

254
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,550
and the the problem is we have a closer
look at what she actually does

255
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,100
on so if you're naive and

256
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,940
think about how it could work then might
soon that your HTML

257
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,570
or get something that I set in HTML will
result in the very same thing in the DOM

258
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,120
so it's a for example go ahead and
silicate I want your image to email to

259
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,000
be full bar

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,380
then I expect that in the bomb there is
actually spring fever

261
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,380
but gets more complicated effect actual
XML to the nation that's true because

262
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,860
the brothers to do something in turn
leads to see like is this really felt

263
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,730
if it's not shouldn't be making ability
invention edit and then you can have a

264
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,720
look at it

265
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,139
so it doesn't really leave things as
they are so we cannot rely on

266
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,589
having a user input stay the same when
it arrives in the DOM

267
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,329
and after reading an article in it might
even have changed but more well

268
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,130
it is the main and if that's the case
and it's not even bad it's actually

269
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,579
quite good because users tend to submit

270
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,440
envelop stuff and the balls to fix it
for them and other than everything's

271
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,570
fine we have

272
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,250
saint on nothing's broken on the website
so we don't want you to market nor same

273
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,899
country

274
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,529
arm I want to find out more about this
and I want to find out

275
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,769
how many variations due browsers
actually commit

276
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,810
before adding the don't know it's better
in coming from an original to the actual

277
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,760
country

278
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,889
on and I these changes in the way
dangerous so we created a little test

279
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:01,500
speed

280
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,130
and just what is author it's available
and chose us basically what in Wrexham a

281
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,000
really does

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,100
used to arm here for example we have

283
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,110
I'm 88 and we have the two you can find
it and which must have said corks

284
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,449
your HTML that's basically it is can
stay there and I have a text area here

285
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,699
and I can write stuff into the text area
and it's going to be displayed here

286
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:27,010
and it's going to be met for an HTML to
that and its content

287
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,449
and afterwards to read it out again and
put the result in to this text area

288
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:33,540
Sony just sherry holbrooke's concern for
example

289
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,649
an excellent and then the whole thing
struck so we

290
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,930
map this piece of markup to the content
of this element

291
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,970
and afterwards for you I've reread out
again show the result in the textarea

292
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,870
and two we can see that something
strange right can can you see this in

293
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,220
classrooms and speaking of socialism in
which

294
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,649
you can wit so here I have an opening at

295
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:57,970
and then the string hello and the Texas
actually struck

296
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,480
as would be expected but the result with
the browser does with it internally

297
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,670
is different because we have a process
and we have a closing element

298
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,430
he was lucky we didn't begin at this
closing element but you re after closing

299
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,010
element

300
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,839
so we see the president's two things
first of all the processes that need

301
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,000
lower case ask her I don't know I don't
know how to fight yet

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,170
but they do know it's before and this is
perky fall

303
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,870
elements element names in uppercase some
just an opportunity for you

304
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,519
and wait a second developer you were a
lazy bastard so you just committed to

305
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,459
closing element

306
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,649
so just gonna headed for you that's so
awesome I am so what's cool things the

307
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,899
I actually like that this that was nice
thank you and

308
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,949
this is actually being done by
everybody's which is being dumb but I E

309
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,500
process have to do this they have to fix
what's coming in

310
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,100
arm I can even go ahead for some which
is like next more instinctive

311
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,120
interior and mintier and you can see all
these things are at it automagically

312
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,440
here's a diffuse yes

313
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,459
the on into brother

314
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,790
so arm

315
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,110
there's interesting stuff when you have
look

316
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,519
it more detailed things intentional so
one of the very simple things

317
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,029
intentionally

318
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,339
are comments like everybody's should be
knowing how much in the Commons Work you

319
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:10,699
start a comment

320
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,889
stuff is commented you and the comment
stuff is not committed any more it's

321
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,920
easy right

322
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,620
so let's have a look with the browser
does internally with comments because

323
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,350
its bets

324
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,470
it's a bit different through the perfect
for example

325
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,620
we go ham selecting we have like a
element here manages

326
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,730
comment here and we just the compact
fast

327
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,560
so we just have the opening lesser than
here

328
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,870
and we have the exclamation mark but the
browser's is like a

329
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,490
I kind of think that you wanted to
comment so I'm just gonna do it for you

330
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,070
in just gonna give you that monster here

331
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,480
like alright palm fair enough

332
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,350
just injured making real comment
American doesn't change anything

333
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,660
so now we have comment now we have
exactly what we expect

334
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,899
be removed this the processes like yeah
but do not closing its on closing for

335
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:55,910
you

336
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,600
right interesting we can remove this
nervously yeah I kind of expect minuses

337
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,870
traditionalists and his gun and for you

338
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,270
rights going a bit far not notes on the
planet the storm

339
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,470
we will this and the possible status
because bro this is like you didn't

340
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,789
close the comment something it wasn't
for you

341
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,020
and so on and it gets more interesting
when we move this thing

342
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,760
and for example thing huh and stuff like
this so

343
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,919
know we comment the dash right certainly
if to hear

344
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,419
and to hear and in the middle coming up
dish it's there

345
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,660
but when the roof this thing you will
see that

346
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,140
upstairs with a 5-2 just don't there's
before

347
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,260
room for more now we have three upstairs
in for downstairs

348
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,610
1 and the removal more let me have to us
there's

349
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,160
report authors what's going on your room
for one more

350
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,570
and that's growing 25 and we were more
and its

351
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,620
you can it for what

352
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,970
that even make sense like that it makes
perfect sense when you have a look at

353
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,360
this

354
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,789
because this is kind of a valid comment
but to make you develop comment

355
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,049
for the browser for the actual engine
the browser has two at the dashes

356
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,919
so this being an end to comment will be
turned into this which is mines mines

357
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,090
and management so that makes sense but
once I at for example

358
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,350
another def the process really sure if I
wanna comment that Dasher is the DEF

359
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,390
part of the comment

360
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,799
so it better X the full comment in the
comments the dash that we need five

361
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,309
and so on and if you think about it does
make sense it's crazy but it does make

362
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,220
sense

363
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,980
on well at least is crazy future is are
consistently implemented

364
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,600
unless you have a look at all the
fathers but you can see there's great

365
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,429
stuff Germany

366
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,950
and it gets closer and we have to ask
ourselves what does the whole thing has

367
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,750
to do with security because their
security conference right

368
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,910
so is there any security impact of this
whole thing

369
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,990
the risks in 2006

370
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,600
in Japan I E fellow desk worker was
working on a document

371
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,200
and wrote some HTML and finished

372
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,490
is documented had some beautiful tables
on their own farms in the head values

373
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:50,990
and with

374
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,500
awesome use it like that is a beautiful
document I'm just gonna send it to the

375
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,260
printer

376
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,490
and just going to do something with the
worst because i like it so much that he

377
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,720
sent to the printer and print it even

378
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,270
one got things going on and you realize
that there was a book

379
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,400
so that the document didn't look the
same kak Tam and I'm going to print

380
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,000
again

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,350
you breathe again it was the same thing
any good crazy

382
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,380
he he he got mad because he realized
that he had no idea what was going on

383
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,179
the content of the form elements of the
input elements

384
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,900
where no part of the document the
bleeding of the elements and the

385
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,950
elements were empty

386
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,860
seems how's that even possible the
company gave up and I think you find a

387
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,090
bug report no one listened and

388
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,140
there was that well not exactly arm

389
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,070
one year later a researcher from Japan
you should gradually governor

390
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,520
analyze the problem and found out that
this is a really really bad problem

391
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,080
and he found the first pointer to what
we wanna call before Forsman

392
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,270
Rmxs mutation excess and

393
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,240
I wanna show you what he found and the I
wanna make

394
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,679
sure the its you know that this problem

395
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,130
existed until mid is your so it was
fixed but does your mid 2013

396
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,140
I'm so we have to live in with this
thing for an almost six years

397
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,360
so let's have a look again we take off
at the brother

398
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,630
I ate we select a so we gonna give you
some external again hun Sen

399
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,390
for example you image time we can see
here here's our image

400
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,870
and there's three Springs Colo
everything's fine

401
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,030
justin is a little bit because begin use
a little strange characters

402
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,720
and the cool thing was HTML is you don't
only have tax your behalf

403
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,870
attributes like how awesomeeee through
the community for them getting source

404
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,250
and point to somewhere and I'm gonna
give it to class

405
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,750
Antti have an end to cast because we
haven't decided on how we gonna call it

406
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,510
and we realized that if we give that
element in Mt class the processes like

407
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,610
happened to class doesn't do anything so
expensive I'm just gonna strip without

408
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,150
Anthony

409
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,400
the injury afterwards okay use TTT
electric good for us just because it's

410
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,750
Andy thats

411
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,000
which I don't know the proposed and then
we going to look at but if we give it an

412
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,890
actual class

413
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,740
the bros construct the element more so
something has to happen so it's in a

414
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,210
classic

415
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,740
and I love some class appears producer
know you get a clasp and I'm just gonna

416
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,580
show with your

417
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,080
know what a special with this class
would especially with the internal

418
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,480
handling of the browser

419
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,929
we seize it there's something very
special

420
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,990
in you know it already you don't have a
razor and that's unfair

421
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,720
that yes the clothes are missing so the
brother sister quotes

422
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,750
calls are expensive just gonna leave
them away and that's not a good thing

423
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,919
so we might soon we're using quotes here
we nice developers but the process trips

424
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:31,580
the quotes

425
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,690
because the cost too much money um do we
have an injection budget adding a space

426
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,280
and confronts and Gaza realizes a how
you I know what you doing the reading

427
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,210
space you want to inject something

428
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,620
and his gun at those quotes again I'm
sorta from

429
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,820
alright fair enough surprise or fair
enough

430
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,650
remove the space quoth disappear again
button went to court

431
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,780
it %ah again the plaza realizes the
record doesn't work at all so

432
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,940
we don't have been something really
better some

433
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,039
can't but

434
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,150
love us usually new that there is
Fourways

435
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,320
after limiting attribute values in IE
the NHL those three

436
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,850
no delivers at all double quotes singles

437
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,980
in IE there's four what's the fourth one

438
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,990
right affected excellent so

439
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,919
you can use the tactic to delimit have
you purchased so if we go ahead and for

440
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,850
example try putting a tactic in here

441
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,190
do you like this then we have to pick
tix realize

442
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,190
that the back tix are not being quoted
so now we have an antique glass

443
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,590
inside a class that is originally
supposed to go back to back

444
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,820
and that means got down we have an
injection so we can for example handsome

445
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
on people's

446
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,980
heard

447
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,880
one an justice this

448
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
protect some time didn't type

449
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,840
400 hundreds was once be so much

450
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,549
so now we have an injection and a
special thing with his injection is that

451
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:09,760
it's completely valid completely same
markup

452
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,400
every XSS filter would say that's cool I
don't see anything bad and here you have

453
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,000
a class property quoted no one breaks
out

454
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,750
you can put whatever conned into the
class I can do with that but the brosser

455
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,780
upon accessing the intellectual property
of that thing

456
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,200
and doing something with that will
remove the double quotes and all of a

457
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,799
sudden become a Nexus S

458
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,700
like out of nothing every XSS filter out
there every single one

459
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,450
let this flu everything along we tested
everything about and none of them

460
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,480
objective

461
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,320
happens and see that there's something
bad in here and this problem was

462
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,950
existing for six-and-a-half years

463
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,350
so for six-and-a-half years everything
replication out there was born without

464
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,610
even knowing it

465
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,570
just by using this trick and well

466
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,630
missus kind of boat people to recruit on
but this just as a reference

467
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,220
on it's pretty bad but it's not news I
mean it's been around since 2006

468
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,669
adjustment really been exploited and the

469
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:03,860
it doesn't even work anymore because it
was patched some weeks ago

470
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,700
so on like a statement of the year it
was actually patch doesn't exist anymore

471
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,419
even in ie8 the problem is not existing
anymore so it's not you it's just on you

472
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,940
we like it and we can use it to see what
and Nexus S is and what the whole things

473
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,190
about both mutations and doing stuff
internally or have the browser do stuff

474
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,669
for us

475
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,770
takers but it's not you the good things
we have you

476
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,679
because there's more there's the
significantly more on

477
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,220
so a browser faces an interesting
challenge when

478
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,659
dealing with unknown elements so with
Michelle you have a name spaces like

479
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,370
this elements and the local headlines
and things and whatnot

480
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,659
but if there's an element that it's not
known that is not unknown in space the

481
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:40,640
numbers is the things I

482
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,270
wanna do Remington and have a look at
this

483
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,720
arm you could sample for can go ahead
and sonic

484
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,990
great an element to the complex and 13

485
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,630
like ok and we have element here not to
prosecute amid

486
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,340
and well fair enough let's just close it
and Wade s

487
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,850
second we close the thing and only the
closing one is there the other one is

488
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,730
gone

489
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,850
there is a bit fishy we have to have a
good

490
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,470
and there was a look in a minute if we
put some content your

491
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,350
and use for example 0 and all of a
sudden the x3 peers because the process

492
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,779
is a yes content

493
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,789
infinite the new element the front of
the unknown elements are better going to

494
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,059
render it some homes

495
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,100
I don't see the logic behind this but
that the pro- duce this

496
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,799
but we can see that dealing with on
elements is kind of weird thing like

497
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,490
purses have trouble doing some

498
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,080
so you can also see that as for example
on no its application for wasn't so on

499
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,010
and now the question is if you wanna
tell the browser what to do with the

500
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,940
unknown element

501
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,270
then we have like one traditional way to
do so and that is using a namespace

502
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,750
declaration you can just go ahead to
like a element

503
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,909
we just gonna give you a little
namespace and in the browser's probably

504
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:47,610
gonna know what to do with the old
friend

505
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,650
and some given namespace like external
and ask people

506
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,150
Mt and unlike last

507
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,770
an empty namespace declaration is not be
permitted so we do know

508
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,880
from just looking at the small detail
the gonna completely entirely different

509
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,419
execution Bronson said the pros and cons

510
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,200
love interest in question is what would
happen if forgive the namespace actual

511
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
content

512
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,450
so it's just for example save me to come
up with a namespace

513
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,650
X all of a sudden I entirely freaks out

514
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,990
and says like 02 just I'm just I'm just
gonna

515
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,000
do something very very crazy just don't
don't judge me

516
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,559
and the we can see that there's like
processing instruction

517
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,830
and it's getting like a namespace as an
element name but that's not really clear

518
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,080
with the sweeps could have come from

519
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,299
is then there is the prefix attribute
then it's there's this base

520
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,390
coming from nowhere equal space and then
something delimited by converting lab

521
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:41,950
records

522
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,760
and then we have something here and idk
right same as that

523
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,000
but we realize that the content of our
names with attribute is actually

524
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,679
reflected without quotes

525
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,580
it's right here forget we have an
injection to be

526
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,440
because the whole thing laments them

527
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,760
for I'm we go

528
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,529
this is also not so good business pretty
silly actually because this shouldn't

529
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,309
happen again we have an attitude you
that this property quoted no one breaks

530
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:11,900
out

531
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,980
with the we have an injection of the
browser is receiving the market Mercante

532
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,100
arm pretty bad

533
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,830
it's actually not that bad it is bad but
not super bad

534
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,620
because most Texas at fitters do not
allow an implicit tributes and we

535
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,100
require it seems that this would
attribute

536
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,630
arm of its not mind this was discovered
by everyone from Russia

537
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,770
but we found it interesting variation
because

538
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,799
we actually do have bad and look at
least a bit worse than that

539
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,640
miniature pursuant to get rid of these
alerts

540
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,710
so here we've been nice we've been
closing the element

541
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,779
you can see it's closed he was the
closing axe use the opening thing

542
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,020
gerson in space everything's probably
quoted and we get this

543
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,220
kind of weird thing here what would
happen

544
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,649
if they're naughty and we don't close
the element which is removed because

545
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,740
we're lazy or not you're just wanna play
around

546
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,570
interestingly this kind of weird
namespace explosion does not happen

547
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,570
if we don't was the element so we can be
really different execution branch

548
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,890
like how many other um and we are so so
it's okay nothing happens there's

549
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,480
nothing special here but wait a second
there was an alternative way of

550
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,289
declaring in spaces which was gonna
fewer and notation right the one with

551
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:25,490
the colons

552
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,440
and we go ahead and for some the fact
that the call on your and then

553
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,830
way sec havoc on your in the columns
there how to how did it go there like

554
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,450
how to travel there

555
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,980
and I was like man at that if this kind
of strange to you say I

556
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,690
view and what no we haven't ING
namespace

557
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,179
and we are just like one space away from
another injection right

558
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:51,340
but Yukon use faces the names places
like come on I think it's a

559
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,659
and in those stone written rules affect
known that namespace cannot contain

560
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:55,950
space characters

561
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,270
so it's just ran out looks in IEEE

562
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,510
that's not the case your accepts places
and spaces and creates image element for

563
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,429
us

564
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,539
so to see this no image

565
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,960
and we have an image orders so that
means we're just gonna hansen's article

566
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,289
thanks and you know it already was going
to happen them

567
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,770
on never mertz and don't think

568
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,000
and we have to the with guys are here
Anamika

569
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,130
and another injection another injection
that doesn't violate the markup

570
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,169
structure and another injection that is
most likely to sleep for x-mas

571
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:33,090
excess voters if it wasn't for the
stupid members but

572
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,600
I think we all understand know a bit
more on hold is going to text word and

573
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,710
welp that wasn't really bad it was
pretty bad

574
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,750
but not too bad on mega said only one
with you

575
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,760
all the other one was was pre is covered
by whenever one

576
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,010
and the this government

577
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,559
because it's few website actually likes
my own ass are

578
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,419
and it only works in certain document
modes arm you can force for example

579
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,610
%eh to accept a similar 5 and and its

580
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,179
between it is not known elements and you
can do these things with it but you need

581
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,360
the Xmas

582
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,429
so it's not entirely bad on

583
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:11,539
but we have bet we actually have really
bad so weeks decided to have a closer

584
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,990
look at this whole thing because it
started to get crazy

585
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,960
and we start to find more and more
variations and more and more attack

586
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,740
techniques that are completely different
but accomplish the same thing

587
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,620
which is an injection inside ballot
insane in B nine mark

588
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,970
so everybody left style attributes right
that was such a great deal with the

589
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,779
style attributes like a

590
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:32,779
mixing together its imbalance yes as an
attribute like two different languages

591
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,020
I was a great idea let that always works
out well so

592
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,070
is just these s we can do that much
style attributes and let's be for

593
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,200
example uses as expressions and

594
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,500
all these common known techniques to do
bad stuff

595
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,520
yes every common every well-trained

596
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,549
Texas as federal know that these kind of
things have to be stripped out to have

597
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,649
to consider

598
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:56,850
rockin I'm well

599
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,380
need to have a look at the richest again
because there's something crazy with Sis

600
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,929
its use slightly more modern browser

601
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,260
and look at them favorites

602
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,990
so we go for for example had some creepy
element and we give the tournament style

603
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,610
and we say we'll see

604
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,279
Daisy say

605
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,919
Connor is expected to direct you write
something in your two one two three four

606
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,909
five six

607
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:25,380
and then we see alright the kind
interest rate this is what the kind of

608
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,190
course but there are some changes there
six monetization here like

609
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,070
space your and ending the semi-colon for
us the before got

610
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,360
because per lazy but in the end there
something unexpected

611
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,610
so many go to the it's like a different
commitment

612
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,000
against you know in an old document note
on which can trigger from the outside

613
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,140
notes upper case but there's again space
and supplements nothing super special

614
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,510
we also can use strings in CSS we can
wait for example can say

615
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,919
found family and you can see for

616
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,120
and then we can realize none bar on some
the complex

617
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,919
it just go ahead and court thus the

618
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,070
know there's an interesting thing if you
for example half

619
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,210
a fun teasing company in this font
designers a scotsman and you want to

620
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,210
create a font that is called on menus
bar

621
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,590
that he needs a scenic boat in the fun
name people to so if you wanna for

622
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,380
example expressing a quote in the fun

623
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,740
name then you would of course to Chris
just destroy this thing like this

624
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,590
doesn't make any sense

625
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,250
so you have to escape it and the way to
actually escape this thing is you think

626
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,320
CSS escapes big surprise and the season
escape for

627
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,580
think it would look at its best sex 27

628
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,580
so perfectly fine here that is exactly
what

629
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,960
the excess fitter accepts and dazzle you
with school everything fine

630
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,470
but upon accessing the interaction a
property you can see the brothers

631
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,630
decoding the escape

632
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,950
that the Escape is now being shown the
canonical representation so

633
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,010
the escape doesn't escape at all 13
excess the enrichment property

634
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,100
so what you can do is move on from this
and for some 33

635
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,240
and you can see Texans in a Colts

636
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,960
and then you see expression and Tom

637
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,880
I'm tempted not to do the alert right
now because then there's going to be a

638
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,649
loop I'm just gonna

639
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:09,140
injections our script that is changing
the location so if you see change here

640
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,220
is changed to one or two with an issue
that the

641
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,830
Scopus executing right through location

642
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:18,590
died half sequence one because the whole
thing

643
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,590
uses Kates ear and

644
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,309
what's missing

645
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,720
are you there after sailors is missing
your

646
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,000
and you can see full a change to one so
we have JavaScript execution if alexis

647
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,820
it's not as spectacular as the major
alert but you can see we execute

648
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,620
JavaScript

649
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,750
with the construct again where nothing
is broken we have to sing a quote here

650
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,640
if the scenic with their we didn't break
anything that has been nine

651
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,110
with the browser weapon is it for us and
renders this month

652
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,059
and that is really really bad and
there's like an extremely

653
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,250
weird feature that uses

654
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,480
to handle something internally that
allows us even to use the escape for the

655
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,710
double quote

656
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,140
2x we create the single quotes a review
for 22

657
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,970
able to become a senior quote so even if
you go ahead and service to fit and

658
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,260
coat all this thing and then have a look
if it's proper not this will

659
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,780
of a go through so you can see here
secret thing a quote from the entity of

660
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,419
a double coat

661
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,419
I may justmaycould 22 so you can see
there's a few clicks you

662
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,260
know the prosecution pigment not to go
and here's the two

663
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,530
so that is pretty bad and it's actually
very very bad

664
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,450
and the big problem with this is thats

665
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,450
up until recently when reported these
things to most of the

666
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,540
vendors and filter manufacturers

667
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,810
that everything was kind of attack about
this and there's not a problem

668
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,849
the problem is that there is like so
many variations for this this is there's

669
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:43,460
one thing

670
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,030
and we had a good move back then when
they were discovered this thing it's

671
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,089
like a customer's hey vendors

672
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,020
do not allow escapes in your securities
as because then you have a problem best

673
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,570
do not allow backslashes at all so

674
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,920
we recommended that and then we'll be
just that we were wrong and that there

675
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,440
is like

676
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,820
possibilities you can do this entirely
without

677
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,440
back missions please don't correction
munies can restrict

678
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,440
them

679
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,770
alright

680
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,329
coming up so wonder interesting
variation I want to show is and we don't

681
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:28,500
have the same

682
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,660
the I'm equals mom

683
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,339
fun family me sad

684
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,760
power and car from some

685
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,790
now we have a fond that has the name by
powerful which is not nice and I you

686
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,369
should call things are from

687
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,109
on but the interesting thing is we again
have quoted

688
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:51,480
and we wanna break out these quotes
without using vexatious but using

689
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,460
escapes

690
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,500
so there is one feature that allows a
Cynthia sass

691
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,800
to change multiple fonts in a fun family
declaration that sounds like a if

692
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,790
there's one fund is in there

693
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,940
use the next one is this one is your use
the next one and so on to provide a

694
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,730
fallback

695
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,609
and he's gonna fall backs are delimited
by a comma but the only are supposed to

696
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:09,320
work

697
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,540
if they are not quoted by strings
because the common should be stronger

698
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,980
than the string of hits but what happens
if the Atacama

699
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,050
the second week at the comma the quotes
disappear because you things like a

700
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,210
year you have a spring on that's cool
but I kind of think that you want to

701
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,700
concatenate some fun names as a fallback
some just can remove those

702
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,030
you know those this listing a quote for
you is that alright know that the her

703
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,190
head is really bad because we have
another injection

704
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,490
because then of course we just have to
close this whole thing and go like next

705
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,750
week with expression and so on and it
can be executed

706
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,079
was good there's even one more thing
that is even worse

707
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,520
and the we discovered that there is a
property that does something extremely

708
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,940
unexpected and that is

709
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,560
on order was it

710
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,050
personally think for spacing and the
coherence Nick from

711
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,460
and we take water space in which look so
benign it so harmless

712
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,770
and we give it a value that is properly
quoted images these interventions

713
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,950
commits the courts just so we don't have
to do anything you don't have to use a

714
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,780
special characters and partly because

715
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,010
it's just disappears and %uh there's one
more variation that I want to show you

716
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,510
which is really crazy

717
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,500
because we learned that we can break
these extremes with using escapes with

718
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,119
using a common with using

719
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,339
we are properties that are not supposed
to do this thing but can be also break

720
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:23,810
the mark

721
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,920
up can we break the entire HTML by using
these things

722
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,190
annexed yes we can so if you would want
to break the action here we would go on

723
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,650
for example tried

724
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,140
to use double quote hoping that this
double quote would be able to break

725
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,270
these double quotes

726
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,220
but as we learned already he transforms
those double quotes blessings quotes

727
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,750
maybe for even that exit purpose but we

728
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,930
so far only tried this thing in
attribute values

729
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:53,260
we never try to snap you names so what
if we go here interest in them

730
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,280
with quote maybe it shouldn't you've got
a quote

731
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,210
a sudden we have a real difficult so we
just and despite attribute

732
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,089
with issues escape inside a property I
what the hell

733
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:08,520
so we can go from here in for example
several images close the whole thing can

734
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,369
create some new elements like up no

735
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:14,250
come to this password so go ahead and
free

736
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,329
notebooks recent 3c

737
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,619
and she and then we clinton's

738
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:24,380
or stick with are no the equals is
medically important

739
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,849
goes into between purposes is that we
can use it again 3 p.m.

740
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:31,450
thanks myspace again on

741
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,250
and hmm 3d in the many things

742
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,650
61 Verte and didn't print

743
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,820
space ok new pace you could just make

744
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,750
nerd personal finance 3e after we got

745
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,500
so that's not good and that shouldn't
happen and that is still there are some

746
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,310
fixes

747
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,460
I think there's a big summer but that
some fixes so

748
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,079
if you have you generate the assassin
your website if you allow is janet is as

749
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,270
make sure that these things can never
happen make sure that the property names

750
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,010
are being validated that certain amount
of characters cannot exist in their

751
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,510
common spectators and some better better
just don't do it

752
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,950
well

753
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,930
there is other problems that we found
comes with Gmail entities so for example

754
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,869
chrome recently mister perfect scenario
phone to report available to Villa

755
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:23,890
Firefox majorly screwed up SPG in 2011
to fix it immediately

756
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,570
and this kind of thing was possible to
insert a style image could use an entity

757
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,050
that was

758
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,750
would automatically transform into
lesser than the execute the code

759
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,079
and ID you can use listing because
everything inside listings already

760
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:35,900
called

761
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,160
and everything the for example using in
the world of tech specs HTML

762
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,339
if you want to avoid extreme and use
XHTML is all too including many many

763
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,079
things to many consolations

764
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,579
everything that a 3.0 is basically
autumn being on a decoded

765
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:53,320
on this applies as well for in an issue
GN for martin also

766
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,970
try to get away from the Minister
jean-marc the militia can because it's

767
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,980
not a good thing it's not mature yet

768
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,450
on and the question is was affected
actually

769
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,900
back then when we did this research most
existing age my fingers and hands were

770
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,380
fixed in the real good ones which were
pure fire Jas

771
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,680
to anti-semitism along quicker haha
whatever so they were all affected

772
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,920
all tested which text editors were
affected most existing weapons were

773
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,420
affected

774
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,000
and when using yahoo mail because they
were affected arm

775
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,710
roundcube other solutions all these
twins were affected on

776
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,859
and we can kind of concrete rules are
basically anything was

777
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,400
effective that forbade standards that
followed the standards because the

778
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,180
standard says hey dude like this

779
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,950
with the brother said no we do
differently would like that and this

780
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,760
kind of gap between the standard

781
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,319
and the present fermentation actually
cost $20 them

782
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,980
which is but that your speech of its not
sure if I was affected beckman

783
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,859
your speech of Bihar the version that
was affected but thanks you can see the

784
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,119
stuff is coming through

785
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,130
argue the expressions are coming through
here's a screenshot of beach in a law

786
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,390
that was affected

787
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,950
and I'm pretty sure that it's not
readable in the last row what we can see

788
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,099
here is X in a lot actually

789
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:04,839
went a step further and almost kid or
back because the Dublin coded stuff

790
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,950
and it looked like this like and present
and then the entity for the whole thing

791
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,310
so it was an escape that was been coded
and uncoded against it actually triple

792
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,240
imported

793
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,650
and we asked ourselves like is this a
problem does that fix the doc

794
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,349
and of course not because the mutations
the MSS ESS

795
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:25,290
so the transformation from an encoded to
decode the state worse records if we

796
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,630
just access in original twice and then a
booty call twice

797
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,260
so if you have crippling coding just 2-3
times a if for Drupal and calling to add

798
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,339
four times

799
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:36,930
on so there is no real limitation for
the attacker here

800
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,650
for your health on this is usually the
election officials to developers show

801
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,730
this presentation on

802
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,300
developer conference and then had to run
om

803
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,880
the question is how do you protect
against this kind of attack so as a

804
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,210
fancy website that is modern and
flexible his good friend Burke

805
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,740
just make sure that standards mode is in
force for your browser avoids getting

806
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,660
frame to use

807
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,050
across from options arm make sure that
you use this

808
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,640
see this doctype and no other doctor
don't use the old

809
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,660
a similar for doctypes: because they
kind of

810
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,319
enable this attack by framing a text use
this one are no one

811
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:13,250
not just just use this one time just
lemme on you Cespedes you can

812
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,760
but everybody dance are motivate users
to upgrade the browser stand

813
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,270
like nothing else avoid Suga mama
because they also enable these kinds of

814
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,970
attacks

815
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,240
actual web sites that really f a bit
more

816
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,760
our cost full maintenance routines
picture fitters on and play streak by

817
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,690
police do whatever you can to avoid
critically at fruits and

818
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:36,329
critical characters and you input be
extremely paranoid about his ass because

819
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,220
he is as gonna screw you over

820
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,960
don't follow the standards because the
standoff may be right but the buzz

821
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,280
around so

822
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,910
follow the probabilities and kinda fix
the box

823
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,250
you know and notable abilities and that
it would be I think just it here

824
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,380
for pen tester arm when you find a
website where you can inject style

825
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,890
attributes specs that you're so
represents you already what might you

826
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,720
have a Nexus S

827
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,920
you can just go home to their well done
we have free book your and if nothing

828
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,319
does respect to treat I mean it's not
really available anymore but Skyblock

829
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,609
on we had a look at the turn to us for
fixing these things like we were

830
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:10,920
thinking about how you can actually fix
this and the client

831
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,050
and Esmeralda small script that connects
to do this occurred to HTML

832
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,410
arm it's basically release and the
whatever the fuck you wanna do with that

833
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,740
license so you can just grab it and it's
your

834
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,790
I'm not going to the democrats we don't
have enough time but

835
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,369
it intercept the access to enraged him
lol and implies an ex emits you realize

836
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:30,819
the based sanitization of the input

837
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:34,380
so its own slow and it is slow but not
too slow tho

838
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,020
on many experiments whose see how far we
can go in the time for fixing this kind

839
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,460
of accident X

840
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,069
well bottom line it's

841
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:46,380
know you see that %uh sections make sure
that you know what this captures on

842
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,680
try to avoid SPG wherever possible
because this is like a really extending

843
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,720
the tech surface on SPG is absolutely
the devil

844
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,650
and the same for my family which has
been extremely complicated to implement

845
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,780
I mean chrome just took my family out
for the brother before the pond on

846
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,300
because they knew that would be pompous
take them

847
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,950
arm take away we almost reached into the
presentation was in for you

848
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,240
as pen tester you just got a free you
welcome back pain and you will find you

849
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,369
will find these things and the wife
doesn't that we find them all the time

850
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:15,150
as a developer are you have better info
on you infiltrate a particular up from

851
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,890
input that you didn't know was malicious
at all on his brother vendor

852
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,190
delivered a pointer for exciting
problems on to watch just like

853
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:25,839
don't don't do these things internally I
mean there has to be manipulations

854
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:26,589
mutations but

855
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:30,940
don't screw them up and for specifiers
this actually some practical hints for

856
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,010
the upcoming specs

857
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,140
and the good thing is there is going to
be upcoming spec because

858
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,160
the w3c took over in your HTML know
there's like an international

859
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,839
specification that is covering all these
issues

860
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:43,859
so they might actually be like you know
like to serve a line on the horizon

861
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,619
where we can actually sell a cave

862
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,800
something good is happening in the world
specifications and maybe at some point

863
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,200
we can actually follow the specs again

864
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,210
um ripping up today we saw arm some

865
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,040
interesting it's not a member of his
three some known a text that we

866
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,980
revisited some

867
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,030
unknown texts to be so for the first
time on

868
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,740
the perfect and just over something that
gives you the free press is the Nexus S

869
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,630
and everything that access external

870
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,550
on some good leads in total offense
defense against these attacks and

871
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:17,220
a kind of the preview for the w3c silver
bullet but maybe 2015 is usable or

872
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,599
because we've got to find them so that's
it

873
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,359
arm if you've any questions just address
the now or later

874
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,730
you can catch me offline and 50 any
comments given to me

875
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:32,630
I'm credit where credit is due on this
was not only my research so

876
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,880
thanks to go with Hayes you should get
together and everyone from Russia I

877
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,440
don't have a lot of Google David Ross
Microsoft which permitted me to

878
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,280
to the stalking to read the paper and is
too funny people who have to sponsor

879
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:50,280
thanks guys and here

880
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:00,000
any questions there's a question I think

881
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,530
deep

882
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,730
source for three-story

883
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:13,490
excesses yup here insecure said

884
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,160
is there anyway to action forced

885
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,470
with application as the user-generated
content

886
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,710
some hold service i cud

887
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,150
spit to actually call interesting

888
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,200
humans print review is yes

889
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,800
that that is exactly the case so the
print for example is is one thing works

890
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,540
to the Lord

891
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,950
love also those yousef

892
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,260
I can't go into too much detail but not
anymore arm

893
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,250
there is other ways you could do this
and there are still some ways left you

894
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,030
can do this

895
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,040
on one thing's for example design mode
but

896
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,040
oh you flick constraint that you have to
have Java installed

897
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,400
so you can only mutated put into this
thing because I but the choice between

898
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,770
executes when you went on a plate by the
mutation and so on but there is waste if

899
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:00,830
we do it but it's completely

900
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,800
so the most prominent ways are actually
user generated HTML

901
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,450
by our which many males or chat messages
or whatever is coming in

902
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,120
so we didn't find likened

903
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,140
atomic bomb that allows us to mutate
texas ass everything about that or stuff

904
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,110
by doing something from the outside we
try to

905
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:22,380
but we didn't became close with design
one thing but we we didn't manage to do

906
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:22,710
so

907
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,510
maybe someone else winsome can't exclude
media

908
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,580
any other questions

909
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:37,580
there's one value

910
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,110
is decision excesses you category love

911
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,620
exercised something done

912
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,340
existence I wouldn't necessarily call it
the Nexus S because

913
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,140
doesn't come from the classic sources
and things arm and it relies on

914
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,650
something to happen that all the other
techniques don't need

915
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:02,360
and jus B-nine mark-up so I would goes
far and collared

916
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,440
you X's s but one might disagree with
that but

917
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,440
I personally think it's a new exhibit
immigrations

918
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,150
if you have further questions just

919
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:26,150
