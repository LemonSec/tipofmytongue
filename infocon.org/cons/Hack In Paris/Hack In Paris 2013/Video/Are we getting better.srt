1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,779
other region today this morning early
thank you for coming appreciate its

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,260
on the kennedy a will be gone but
anyways I

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,070
literally went with you must think so um
but welcome to an AA meeting

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,590
this talks to me basically about
security and I formed in the structure

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,220
of army now calls anonymous

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,300
i meeting in reason I did that is you
know getting just a little bit but

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,609
and secure think you really have a
problem and I it's been diction towards

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,820
technology in things that don't
necessarily work

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,210
and I'll talk is from Ron basically
bypassing all the difference as a

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,880
technology that out there that we use
every day to protect us

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,570
so it's a little bit to talk about are
we getting better and really

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,200
saying if we are in a area

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,500
I just a quick introduction i'm taking a
prayer the social engineer toolkits

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,520
I wrote the book minutes what the
penetration testers guy and and when the

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,780
founders a Derby Conn

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,809
I and I'm 1 I've I found a company
called trust in sac which is

17
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,530
back in the states in Ohio so out %uh
for just get started

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,439
so anybody ever been to a outcalls
Anonymous meeting you only have to raise

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,269
your hand if you have

20
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,270
on be more than welcome to you you know
in a meeting in the United States as you

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,590
have

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,900
you know a certain amount of steps you
have to do to you I get better dammit

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,220
they have a problem so

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,299
this all talk is in the BC form and for
men around

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,090
obviously breaking your body down and
showing them the different things that

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,479
at the resulted in such technology can
bypass

27
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,909
and from there almost arts ability back
up and actually how to do

28
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,970
security properly so busy precursor to
work for a private company apologize I'm

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,450
missing you living very much I love you

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,329
but it's not in in spite that's just to
you show you different parts and then

31
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,159
from there we have

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
so first things first if you look at

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,780
arm what we all we do in securing how we
can have a problem in an usher

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,130
the same here but typically when you
look at companies

35
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,509
um you know the the center the investing
a lot of Technology tinged islamic on

36
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,469
you know our new piece of technology to
try to help prevent attackers and

37
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,360
hackers from being able to bypass

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,219
you know or be probable a from stopping
you from getting into the organization

39
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,610
and so you know the first thing I do is
a member your body down

40
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,869
inevitability backup just a quick
statistic

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,980
you look at aubrey statistics missus
from Ogden loss DB .org

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,280
I mean look at last year we had one
thousand six and I 10 reaches

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,870
and then this year long we're definitely
on track office him out so you look at

44
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,220
that

45
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,770
that some percentage-wise we had a forty
seven percent increase and different

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,989
types of breaches that we had

47
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,910
are meant to provide some attacks we
have from from last year just her from

48
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,160
the

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,500
from 2000 a what 02-11-2012

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,420
so we're not getting better when it
comes to them on a bridge that we're

51
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,940
seeing

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,620
you're seeing spend increasing over and
over again so

53
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,220
going in today as anybody here have an
action firewall

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,129
right or anti-virus never ever what
application firewalls

55
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,290
behavior analysis statistics data loss
prevention all these are typical

56
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,849
techniques and and and and

57
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,450
technologies that we use everyday to try
to protect us against different types of

58
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,120
attacks

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,769
am unsure how to bypass everyone on
today so

60
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,420
mention fire was my favorite arm nation
firewalls

61
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,040
count out everything right out to be
behavioral analysis it out to have come

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,760
to a consortium of up tools and
technology to stop

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
spam filtering content filtering on
network analysis

64
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,370
all those are a common things that it
out as far as mentioned fire was anybody

65
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,819
you know use an action filed have chance
player from you

66
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,080
call so was issued in connection
firewalls

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,920
and I what's funny about them is this
still using the same type antiquated

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,220
technology that were used to back in the
nineteen nineties

69
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,400
me know how mission fire was actually do
behavior analysis

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,069
from the networks at the house in a
media signatures

71
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,590
right reason signatures the same thing
that ever sees the same thing that we've

72
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,110
been using for a number of years

73
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,890
and yet that's being touted as kinda the
next generation of how we're gonna

74
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,049
protect against attackers

75
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,069
so to say something I may be releasing a
desk on this year and Om

76
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,739
I wrote this and I was on a pen tester
had a passion for all a

77
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,750
Singh and so

78
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,659
if you look at this in at how easy it is
to bypass now

79
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,340
all actually show you how to arm deploy
no other not be some an hour or

80
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,720
compromise your system

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,450
getting code execution on machines the
easy part it's getting that information

82
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,680
out at the organization out a firewall
or you know egress wisest that the

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,440
challenging part

84
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,630
so she then a second what this does over
losing all code at

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,330
Def Con what this does is hidden my
badge let me see just sitting here

86
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,030
listening

87
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,110
of four a connection and so the
connection itself

88
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,759
is a special our connection its
completely unique not a ten-second

89
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,470
and I fully passed on as a machine
spring

90
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,620
us we had to get her execution as I can
but what's gonna happen is going to

91
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,210
inject

92
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,240
arm assembly coach Ames mami its gonna
encapsulated run SSH

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,639
management all over HTTP ICS TBS

94
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,940
and its gonna choke up in a way that's
polymorphic in nature so it completely

95
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,090
and then if it changes every single time

96
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,050
and I doesn't get picked up anything out
there and on these for I think it s in

97
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,930
about seven different action firewalls

98
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,780
are getting out and personalize it
establish connection to look over here

99
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,330
missus polling for cash upon for
connection here's identifies Inc a

100
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,740
tunnel

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,410
it enlarges Metasploit and we should
have a cell

102
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,500
so that right there on talk about eight
hours to write

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,419
army gun-running termination fire one
works on all them in a problem with this

104
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,259
one

105
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,360
as can be difficult to fix for any phone
as that there's nothing that can be

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
resting it run its it's completely
dynamic in changes every single time

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,270
and it's a difference of cipher key
every single time in a book by mutations

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,190
by more pics 0

109
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,259
there's nothing you can we read a
signature on and doesn't look Tom normal

110
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,120
when it comes to you the

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,419
among her quest for going back and forth
the only difference is love it's looking

112
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,789
out to sea and typing fast

113
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,389
and it you know it as a little
aggravation on the cup semi-final

114
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,210
so this right here is what are the easy
things you can do to circumvent nection

115
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,259
firewalls

116
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:54,259
makes it super simple and gets run if
anyone other

117
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,110
so what are getting far also have
occasion for going to demonstrate a

118
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,810
and are but whatever kitchen farrell's
actually problem the more difficult ones

119
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,810
to break it takes one hour to bypass
those depending on which one to using

120
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,940
and wait miss an hour salata Google you
have to do to figure out what reason for

121
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,450
entering

122
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,100
armed with a check for and there's a to
what are called level of that and

123
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,210
actually goes and identifies what type
of

124
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,580
when a vacation firewall on is being
used in from their efforts and her via

125
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,260
or

126
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,720
know something else out there I need to
do is just on look at how they're

127
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,300
actually

128
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,340
arm doing me and Tom inspection of the
attacks in Justin Cote a certain way to

129
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,890
get around it

130
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,720
and Espana bypasses online for free much
anyway revocation farley want

131
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,010
are together on suppose a pretty easy so
estimate on the bypass those about an

132
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,370
hour

133
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,220
now this next these nets attacks on a
show you so my favorites are behavior

134
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,000
analysis

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,120
whitelisting blacklisting anti-virus and
SMS text

136
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,030
units but critics so much for fatal ones
I'm sure to bypass all those exact same

137
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,680
time is often much related in dancing
for technology

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,330
are to be here on the house is an
interesting concept because you're

139
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,090
supposed to be able to detect certain
predefined behaviors

140
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,150
Arvind akela right so no hay

141
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,990
i doing things a certain way that looks
suspicious am i doing something that's

142
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,560
different animal it shouldn't happen

143
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,169
the probably running to hear onassis's
are so much code so many things to many

144
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,600
different applications that are being
run every single day

145
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,210
just normal in our environment it's
almost impossible tell from behavior Sam

146
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,890
poisonings acting lessons are not

147
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,260
and so just as an example we're doing a
on it's in response

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,580
arm and it was you know the company in
compromise for a number of years and

149
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,510
they're just farming all the traffic on
a date out Google Drive which book

150
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,610
legitimate traffic

151
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,590
in Alicia perform these Google
applications for everything other

152
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,370
business abs

153
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,490
and so they don't even know so you
looking at behavior it it's really

154
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,350
difficult for anything to stop it

155
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,780
of a simple fact that nothing really
looks on our normal when it comes to

156
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,960
different types of attacks

157
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,169
I'm if you look at like Symantec
Endpoint Protection behavior on outside

158
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,390
the house is just looking for we are
suspicious

159
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,530
no connections but this only flag on
anything also had a bypass and a second

160
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,419
are whitelisting blacklisting

161
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:05,080
nobody ever use where the same
blacklisting organizations role so hard

162
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,020
to actually implement

163
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,200
on large-scale away the same web
listings an interesting concept in was

164
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,479
really my best and second to you

165
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,539
on the way this in black listings in
Casa because you know you it takes an

166
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,169
application that should be way less than

167
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,289
on that should be allowed and then it
says I'm not allow anything else

168
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,430
well that's only for executing was right
well nothing's RRT waitlisted like

169
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,210
know for example in Explorer processes
that are trusted that we can use that we

170
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,510
can manipulate an attack

171
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,850
on that are already way this unused so
in

172
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,469
now see you one other the awesome 10
seconds for bypassing it was partial

173
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,120
but are witnessing black listening is
essentially trying to disallow anything

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,400
from

175
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,458
executing that would necessarily be
lamisil process

176
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:46,350
or look funny 10 in her fire i yeah

177
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,589
so on it's enough a me every time you
saw Shannon talking before

178
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,680
couple people I get skin we've seen

179
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,730
so going to fire anybody to any repeat
seven dollars for the soul singer talker

180
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,290
no okay so a corner fire either during a
confrontation

181
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,520
and no talking about the had the exploit
toolkits in

182
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,910
know what you can use on as far as I the
underground hacking community

183
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,920
I'm an evil hackers using mister for a
low price is 70 dollars you can on the

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,910
social engineer talker

185
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,580
arm social enough to talk it I was the
open source I'm it's free

186
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,100
but if anybody's actually paying someone
to ask you just give it to me because

187
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm not make any money off it so

188
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,680
gonna be awesome sand and

189
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,589
just know that there was fire eyes are
innocent other presentations I some you

190
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,890
know never got a response back so I
think there's still time people that

191
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,410
sets

192
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,700
summer box I'll see that some day
anniversary don't think it must seem

193
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,110
talk about an antivirus

194
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,160
army base we get I'm back trying to
defeat anti-virus on because there's

195
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,550
nothing up as we stopping

196
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,620
on things are based texan industry all
those right now

197
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,620
this is a new version Association it's a
look at that session released today

198
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,540
and was nice about this attack is
anybody here

199
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,790
on for very firmly power shown how to
use partial tax things like that

200
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,900
couple can so back in a

201
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,520
I don't know just got 18 I think it was
and I spoke a black n smoke have gone

202
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,530
and as one partial one first came out on
is always are looking for someone like a

203
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,570
to sings amazing

204
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,800
is a basic gives as a fall armored full
ability to pretty much problem anything

205
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,730
we want to you

206
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,220
on the operating system and as part of
that we figure out a couple ways of

207
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,890
getting around your work or execution
restriction policies

208
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,589
and so ask your surgeon policies for
Microsoft when it was being released

209
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:30,410
back in

210
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,880
and no and 2009 on said no excuse
restriction policies are a way to

211
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,560
prevent

212
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,000
on you know on authorized access such
that they may not be signed or may not

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,670
be arm

214
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,959
you know on a lot on operating system we
didn't talk at at

215
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,459
at art theft on a black cat are the fix
that they gave was the change the

216
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,650
wording and it is a

217
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,190
obfuscation shipping policies are not
any in safety zones the past it

218
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,880
after the documentation I so it still
available today the different types of

219
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,040
attacks and you can use

220
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,290
and still allows you to basically run
anything he wants you on the operating

221
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,640
system itself so much for an example
this

222
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,520
misusing the social engineer talkin and
wanna do some work on website is gone

223
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,020
just the sex on can see many budding

224
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,660
and some ago sonic on the web sites
gonna pull the back it's going to

225
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,280
rewrite it

226
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,180
it's going office get everything it's
gonna arm ring fit everything and

227
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,350
everything in sight is

228
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,910
I'm done with AES 256 inflation so
everything from the show kodak is

229
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,660
deploying

230
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,860
to anything that gets trapped in a
system is all for and and on

231
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,670
included with a dynamic cipher key and
captivity for the 60 s everything times

232
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,990
you can listen to it

233
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,070
and when the call techniques is on using
it I'm a technique called in

234
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,730
pie injection and

235
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,040
yet school

236
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,060
American so what's what's happening here
is what sets loaded ready to go

237
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,610
not BC I would do something like nom no
create a fake websites from going in

238
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,199
attacking an organization

239
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:59,449
thing that I made it simple as I'm gonna
go to the website on all the register a

240
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,500
domain the notes are summer to them

241
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,220
a personal web safer for 15 box of INS's
also for 20 bucks

242
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,050
and then I'll create a fake website
looks look simply whatever shit we

243
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,910
should perform

244
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,820
and I don't target one or two or three
people and the reason I really target

245
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,260
want to the people

246
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,370
arms because as you start growing volume
of people they are attacking you have a

247
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,050
higher detection renovating pop

248
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,240
so only target of you do if you need
visuals and I wanna go after

249
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,400
no wait a little bit maybe awesome a
couple more like two or three I'm into

250
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,380
this way for people to

251
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,900
to start clicking on links now this this
attack itself

252
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,500
doesn't actually using it above
exploring so using our job was designed

253
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,300
and actually

254
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,400
when I'm gonna do at 6:30 sign

255
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,699
on but you can arm you know jobs model
love

256
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,560
Apple it's for example is is
fundamentally flawed and how it actually

257
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,550
the poison

258
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,100
a job applicant doesn't according to the
San boxing allies to execute anything

259
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,380
you want in on line annoying opening
system

260
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,190
allows you to attack a DOM I and
offering system without having to

261
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,300
use any type of export whatsoever f ing
as a the

262
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,060
on Apple's themselves are significantly
double specially when you going to

263
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,560
target individuals in fact

264
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,260
you can put in there click this link
that says I'm going to you know it's

265
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,800
going two hundred and hearing it wrong
if people do it

266
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,530
arm by attending today the attack is
really really simple and works really

267
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,360
well

268
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,930
now this is using I think actually this
anniversary job came out what seems like

269
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,300
it's

270
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,250
it's one every day so may I get a
warning here but other than that

271
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,510
so the website

272
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,550
and looks like my website membership
reform now

273
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,540
would you guys trust this

274
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,370
I wouldn't every he was like nah nah nah
security oh and you definitely wouldn't

275
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,550
Harvey

276
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,170
added 101 love two weeks ago and where
the guy that hired us

277
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,050
got hired us we on were sitting on the
test message is shown the exit we can

278
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,829
run

279
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,990
on you know so I mean it's believable in
every way she performed you can't make

280
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,520
the say whatever you want to

281
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,130
on I could have a say you know whatever
company and are going to have to trust

282
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,780
that said I can say whatever

283
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,940
are and you know and and this one is
this is a arm

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,230
coaching certificate okay so this is a
valid code saying sir

285
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,400
me know the prosecuting a coaching
certain

286
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,579
use the legitimate business alright so
for

287
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,630
for 20 or 30 bucks you can mister
legitimate business

288
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,280
and then you going for Cheetos answer
for about 150 bucks from godaddy

289
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,630
and I have a fully flashed you know
working legitimate believable sir

290
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,260
now soon as a run on this it's not gonna
deploy any type a binary it's not gonna

291
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,400
deploying execute it was not gonna play
anything

292
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,160
all's gonna do is can use PowerShell to
inject assembly go straight into memory

293
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,130
never touching desk gets around
whitelisting blacklisted because parcel

294
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,990
has to be waitlisted in Windows

295
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,950
art actually operate efficiently because
it uses things like help menus and

296
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,589
updates and things like that

297
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,980
I'm so it automatically execute polish
on online offering system

298
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,370
shoot are so going into memory and want
full access the computer

299
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,350
right so soon as the minutes from here

300
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,480
he knows what happened out of here he
noticed that

301
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,610
going back to legitimate site so the so
the victim never knew that there had a

302
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,050
bath in the first place

303
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,470
so it makes you look more believe
whatever we should perform and actually

304
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,860
on the website now

305
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,790
go back to hear you see Obama shells
here

306
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,020
I so really take me to do and I'm it's
enough to you like if I

307
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,130
and if I have a US %um yessi another
medical technique if you don't know

308
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,950
on his user access control Buzi
substantial

309
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,010
arms the US is an issue in this is an
old ex what are these on back in 2011

310
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,420
but still work today sorry I got taxes
done I'm

311
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,810
right which means that I i'm unable to
open myself to the system to get

312
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,649
for permission because you draft
schedule stopping me a US even offers a

313
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,760
little money box that pops up click Yes

314
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,880
pop up so yes well that's doing the same
boxing you into a small environment

315
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,170
where normal user account

316
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,839
and then only all these permissions
administrator we needed now

317
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,160
we found a flaw back in 2011 are where

318
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,670
basic me log into Windows machine this
process is that are spawned under your

319
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,899
user account

320
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,190
and in in that and that's a scenario
those processes

321
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,830
on don't always prompt you for USA Today
but you see it's more a txt ever

322
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,550
triggering and saying hey any
administrative all rights

323
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,810
no right don't have received for ABC
attorney for that

324
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,709
just looking at why is that and the
process themselves are actually signed

325
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,500
with what's called a trust the publisher
certificate which what was that

326
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,890
arm from being able to you on bbrt sure
to buy you seen

327
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,760
and so since those processes are being
on says those processes are being

328
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,570
spawned on the context a user account

329
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,000
we can inject into them and have them
call a DLL a deal then triggers are

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,730
skewed a born in runs under the contact
the process

331
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,459
we now have a UACC fell and there's a
model Metasploit for

332
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:36,000
arm makers are a quick

333
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,630
action

334
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,730
it's been a little above you leaving
work to do some work on a so

335
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,730
hope it does work we'll see added

336
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,230
suffering get system block you will
escalate

337
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:02,230
around using get around it and it's
happening

338
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,480
networks on a fully pass well as a
machine is still has an effect on the

339
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,550
reason being is

340
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,580
on it's a flaw in how you issue is I'm
on selection after we ought to take the

341
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,260
redesign

342
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,350
everything about you we see in order to
fix it I'm so works on anything you want

343
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,720
to you

344
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:22,720
home into 7 Windows Vista I and when is
a fully pass no problems at all

345
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,290
now that was estimate that partial tak
is there's no

346
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,850
and this is not knowing that I know
today of detecting that our reason being

347
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,950
is you're not touching discovery just
running a partial commander spawning a

348
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,130
partial process

349
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,510
arm not from the injecting the memory
I'm sure that looks like

350
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,600
I release it or just the other day and
this is actually I'm including two new

351
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,460
version set

352
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,690
and actually the new version a set has
to be really need in it on so when

353
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,929
injecting into memory

354
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,220
are is running a 64-bit platform
typically have some you know

355
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,450
inject 64-bit shoko train of you on an
x86 you haven't checked snowy out that

356
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,659
if you buy shocker

357
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,679
I'm so what I end up doing in the new
version a set which is now are to be

358
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,860
committed today

359
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,200
is it I i'm for gotta we're doing what's
called me on process downgrade attack

360
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,480
which basically what I do is when I'm
going and checking the show code I

361
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,860
detect what a nice 64 32 bit

362
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,450
arm up a system if it's a 64-bit

363
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,360
on offering system automatic downgrade
the process to 32-bit processing

364
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,200
just injected you know it's a sex shop
all day long and 64-bit processor

365
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,270
so it allows us to inject in any type of
arm system that we want to not have to

366
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,350
worry about snow and ice tea for 32 bit
so it's much more efficient

367
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,210
and is actually lot meaner mystery what
it looks like it's what's nice about

368
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,600
this

369
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,130
is anybody been in a pen test before
where on

370
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,450
you know you're using like PS exec a
mess boyden gets picked up and about us

371
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,870
or arm you know you're going you find
sequence action in the spa next week

372
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,950
Manchester procedure and you trying to
inject into that me after

373
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,740
for got a way to deploy a binary and
stuff like that answer to me when does

374
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,580
have a situation before

375
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,110
so with this attack miss a lot easier
mystery looks like this it's all

376
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,380
cosmetic unicorn

377
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,470
around getting brighter

378
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:06,470
15 I soma do

379
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,220
and just simple syntax the run unicorn
I'm you get a %ah

380
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,350
whatever people you want to mess boy
work for you come back on again this

381
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,100
anniversary so it's gonna

382
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,380
she originated from the person's
computer originates and out to us the

383
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,540
rest of the room

384
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,540
its gonna hit now this is gonna
generating for us

385
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,830
sorta exports to files one is up the the
National partial text you can copy paste

386
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,250
a second is on RC file to run the
Metasploit Council K

387
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:41,080
Summit is open this up for a quick
welcome to one is here

388
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,419
and I'm in Iran

389
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,360
Darcy file nominee do

390
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,139
is open up this command that this is the
command bigots execute on machine itself

391
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:57,929
if you notice down there and this is how
we're able to bypass execution

392
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,179
restriction policies much tougher their
own

393
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,960
our back door into partial which isn't
what we conquered command

394
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,720
own predicament as you just have to chop
get a partial screw-on code looks like

395
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,720
this: signature show you're a quick

396
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,730
so if you look here here's our actual
power soco

397
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,380
and Om you look at this it's just
PowerShell I'm syntax

398
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,830
and an hour doing missus are Matthew
Grevers attack here

399
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,409
on Israel just injecting into a process
elk in the memory

400
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,909
right and then rescuing the show go on
and that's it so this is this is the the

401
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,649
partial sin taxes that were using

402
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:41,830
and all we do to get around excuse
restriction policies in a min

403
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,409
even in its most restricted form just a
call it house okay

404
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,610
we cast unico dynamic ever it's
basically for and we passed the bay 64

405
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,370
King palm

406
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,620
you know on blah blah I'll data through
PowerShell command and then execute on

407
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,330
the system itself not the word about
execution research and policy so

408
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,659
it allows you to circumvent there's a
lot of other ways of doing it too

409
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,060
obvious ones in with just the most
efficient as we see here this

410
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,050
this code here is just unicorn basically
for its all this

411
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,850
in a more rational as an operating
system the stands for are no profile

412
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,320
when the styles hidden I am

413
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,120
niner active soda pop up on the window
and this thing called a command is all

414
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,770
abbreviating shortened because

415
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,780
we need to keep a small as possible so
we can still execute commands on the

416
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,590
operating system

417
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,850
our command line so we copy is a
highlight it

418
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,730
you know is here you know shells rain

419
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:41,730
this is a case that in over here

420
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,050
to dinner

421
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,809
second

422
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:57,809
from real slow

423
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,720
real slow anything

424
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,990
news for dinner

425
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,310
sure in

426
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,310
how you get the basic omission are
stressing

427
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,760
it on FB happens and set set
automatically does a partial stuff for

428
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,790
you look behind the scenes

429
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,950
so they accept the job Apple actually
attacked whether or not

430
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,210
up ourselves on the scene in if it's
installed Iran's exiled

431
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,630
or otherwise abet partial is installed
in a fall back to

432
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,870
on dropping a minor machines also does
multiple methods are trying to

433
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,070
times in fact it but also in other way
to

434
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,270
which is nice other since the I had one
earlier just

435
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,270
came to area shimon and a second noticed

436
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,890
to get with our Personal just by P
copying pasting the code in

437
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,140
now how do you get that have an
execution was a few different samples

438
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,510
arm so in a pen test a lot times anybody
ever cover muscle machine in use across

439
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,220
from machine on the rest on

440
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,170
on this actually call on ni trick in in
minutes played if you don't know it's

441
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,540
called his exact command

442
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,820
been

443
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,410
I'll answer in peace is a command

444
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,910
was nice if it is you just give it a
command line to run in the negative

445
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,670
trestles

446
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,510
you automatically going to run through
all your system so they can issue it

447
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,600
supports our hosts

448
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,080
she can scan in a multiple mom you know
arm so i didnt

449
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,270
syringes and actually have an execution
on the system's you want to

450
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,320
to just look at summer wasn't

451
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,580
to visit a command here is used and
running again systems we need to you

452
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,680
was a logical tricks that you can use on
with

453
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,310
with this just a super simple way of
getting around it in

454
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,370
you know deploying these papers things
are are some simple

455
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,480
arm especially comes the set all this
gets run anti-virus

456
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,020
the new version especially versus that
I'm I think from version 5 above

457
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,360
so funny story arm the job so for
longest time

458
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,470
on antivirus rar vendors were just
trying to get down on my by a reason

459
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,730
right signatures for inside

460
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,500
didn't need I moved away from minors
completely just because they're just

461
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,950
raising it was my stuff

462
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,460
and then I would happen if they start
going at my job applicant and fucking my

463
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,870
job Apple has been on missus

464
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,010
I'm so what in its funny because every
time I do new release a set

465
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,130
I can see all the IP spaces from all
antivirus companies to my web sites the

466
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,040
racing it is for

467
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,680
to become a man so what I did is our I
spent about two months

468
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,610
on running a polymorphic job at Apple I
think it's a blow to get up every two

469
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,160
hours

470
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,630
answer every single time you get support
it's completely dynamic completely

471
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,170
change in every single way to perform

472
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,600
all the strings are crafted the entire
on tap at its office in credit

473
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,840
on different every two hours into the
day the last about nineteen times on the

474
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,610
phone to give up

475
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,080
arm so the app itself never gets picked
up an arson or so getting

476
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,940
crazy guys

477
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:01,900
so antivirus

478
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,930
our behavioral I my the sting
blacklisting

479
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,400
Paris Texas another interesting when I
guess it's kinda been the same lines as

480
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,160
as behavior but looks for predefined had
his attackers use

481
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,540
good concept but neither never
implemented in any way shape or form in

482
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,720
a move that also BC

483
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,010
the OP the same as anti-virus

484
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,370
on going around that's pretty easy
parked at a filtering

485
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,390
is an interesting one so content
filtering I will be releasing this is a

486
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,580
tough kind as well

487
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,760
sorts and good

488
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,470
and I

489
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,950
sewers your news

490
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,580
so this is a arm what this does

491
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,080
is it takes me me take a blob in as you
taxed as a simple format

492
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,130
are the content filtering tries to stop
in prevention from using

493
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,500
are like it's cubans race you can
download the .ics ease all this does is

494
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,640
partial to grab

495
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,280
hacks blob download uncovered about a
minor free it's a real simple concept

496
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,300
on just easy ways of getting around
saddam getting around content filtering

497
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,800
so

498
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,800
local stuff out there makes it super
easy to do

499
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,880
well that that's the i'ma firm fireEye
by the way on this engine

500
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,390
never responded back side is that age
probably stop saying that you know it's

501
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,070
also for some

502
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,290
box use among its action another one
that this cover preventive measures

503
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,910
on murphy was an SS peace are they
picking on the mississippi's because

504
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,040
they basically nothing in the ghetto
money for

505
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,510
I so I mississippi's are we have
outsourcing all your security

506
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,650
your mining a texan to a company that
supposed to be moderate right

507
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,190
and lot times are doing is looking at
predefined can things like a someone

508
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,400
running in SS on our environment someone
running

509
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,630
your brain scans environmental %ah times
and even detect those horrible

510
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,730
on a lot in light and flexible thing to
the mess they got your flash having an

511
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,000
attacker doesn't get access to
environment as is at a domain admin rain

512
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,930
on what's funny because from the
conversion from 2003 to 2008 the event

513
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,580
ID's

514
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,080
a change offer ending a domain name into
private group and no one ever checks

515
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,780
that

516
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,110
so if you just at a domain name into a
seventy does the most cases I'll never

517
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,880
flagged

518
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,040
on any type of our you know money you
have out there which is nice

519
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,240
but minor in session no its concept
again in its is supposed to help

520
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,600
the promises we try to outsource the
majority of it to you other vendors are

521
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,470
experts that

522
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,420
that claim to do something and in the
lot times on they don't I actually

523
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,160
attacked it now

524
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,640
lot of other companies that Manning's
action only maybe have a half a person

525
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,420
dedicated to it

526
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,610
and all they're looking at as alerts at
a freak an insider these these tools

527
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:32,980
right

528
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,210
and a lot something armature any of
those Mike I'm not gonna sit there and I

529
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,770
can run s answer environments to noise
into lower

530
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,820
I miss them attack your web application
attack yourself and you never gonna see

531
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,840
I'm so these things on to be work as
well social a different technologies

532
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,270
right

533
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,190
arm that I miss and even my way the
missing technologies try to bomb them

534
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,960
all up

535
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,970
than this one to share everything about
us meeting

536
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,280
their mammogram her so

537
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,680
very easy as far as an attacker's
concern is getting around those com

538
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,770
in thing that's interesting about these
attacks is not anything really different

539
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,240
than what I was doing ten years ago

540
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,420
and you're still breaking in with the
same type of things are going I mean if

541
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,800
you look at the time for breaches are
experiencing a type of attacks

542
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,560
overseeing

543
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,860
it's the same stuff for talking a buffer
overflow talking about Segel gesture

544
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,670
talking about

545
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,140
no on you're not not securing web
applications proper the same stuff

546
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,590
that's been around for 10 years

547
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,400
and yet the technologies you know
attempted to progress in a way that

548
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,730
stops a subset actually still falling
Spanish or are being able to protect

549
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,760
so the first things first our technology
isn't working

550
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm least not for me when we come in and
we're going to companies that have all

551
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,720
these pieces technology units
implemented properly

552
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,130
just that one step to zoom in the
definition

553
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,600
love of insanity a chance I mean it was
a definition is any

554
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,360
here so doing the same thing over and
over expecting different results like to

555
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,340
call it in for a sec

556
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,750
and so exchange dictionary to you if a
sec because we continue to the same

557
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,410
exact thing over and over again and
expecting different results

558
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,200
so whether it's you know putting
signature analysis and selection for a

559
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,690
loss

560
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,230
where it's using POP that this it is
supposed to stop the leakage which

561
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,110
is anybody here have an information
classification program that actually

562
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,370
targets critical data

563
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,750
me moderates from having will be cool
because that all that over half the

564
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,410
traffic

565
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,610
right so none other casino to get
attacked in and so a lot of the server

566
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,330
text are sophisticated nature

567
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,660
are still using the same thing so you
think you can't seem to keep going the

568
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,820
same way that we're going

569
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,100
we have to change something
fundamentally and do something

570
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,230
fundamentally different

571
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,380
in order to get better and so we can to
go this way

572
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,160
which is the same or this way which is
completely different and just crazy talk

573
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,840
rape so you want to keep doing the same
thing you can see the rest the talk is

574
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,780
the estimates for the folks that want to
change in

575
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,890
no admit that they have a problem um
with you if you are leaving school

576
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,280
with your time core wrestler awesome

577
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,610
3 so what we need to do

578
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,570
is actually in in securities issued your
hands during this is the worst thing for

579
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,720
us especially being nerds

580
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,210
play an enemies I'm I'm not on what you
guys are not but now being urs

581
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,850
in being being someone that's kinda for
introverts no talking to people working

582
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,260
with organization doing things that
actually require us to actually but the

583
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,420
hands and do things

584
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,910
I think that we don't typically doing it
for a sec we expect the PC technology

585
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,060
that we we put into place that to work
for us and that's kind of it

586
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,280
so and set up a 12 step program in a
meeting to go to five suffered a much

587
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,480
simplified it made it easier city's five
stops

588
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,510
I think that you can do you to make us a
free program better over a significant

589
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,800
you're so cute I'm

590
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,480
and help you out so for seven is the
first thing that anybody should donate

591
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,740
organization period specially forget
there's

592
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,500
is the best as change the culture now
look at phnom

593
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,390
when you got an organization what woody
in a do you have employee orientation

594
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,270
teach you about the company right we
have to do how it works like a start you

595
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,130
have to submit an expense in your
company

596
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,630
de nada contact HR if you're a problem
or you know

597
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,020
haiti i can text me for medical benefits
secure is no different

598
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,100
what we do in case if I identify
security issue who I contact or I go to

599
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,610
just simple things like that

600
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,610
but at the end of the day no fixing II
an organization takes a lot of work in a

601
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,070
min in requires people to be overly
communicate about what you doing

602
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,570
and reason being is in most cases more
companies and I go into my computer to

603
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,200
see securities looked like that

604
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,440
wanna just continues the like Rob every
business the wrong way writes the ones

605
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,890
that making stop its want to stop
production stuff for business

606
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,630
I'm so lots of his combative nature
verses wanna sex you trying to help

607
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,730
so you know lots of the year security is
the big brother Adam honoring us things

608
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,760
like that

609
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,900
well prior to me Simon company owes a
chief security officer before she 1000

610
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,100
companies so we were

611
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,850
you know a billion dollars twenty
thousand employees on international

612
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,720
endorse any some countries

613
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,400
and when I did the first thing I did
when I was there as i sat down and start

614
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,460
talking to people let me know what we're
doing

615
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,650
on whatever everything from just
educating them in certain things

616
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,330
I'm telling them something strange is
that we're doing all those this really

617
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,470
helped my cause my friend implement
things

618
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,170
and I was doing stupid stuff like you
know so the CS over fortune 1000 company

619
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,490
owes it to you know us in at two o'clock
in the morning helping

620
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,740
someone fix that PC at home you know
just stuff like that it makes a huge

621
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,570
difference to people guess what that
person the fix the computer for

622
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,060
will do anything you want them to you
from here on out because you help them

623
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,790
out

624
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,690
it's letting you know looking at branch
because we are gifted in security we

625
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,240
know who secured a really well

626
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,850
using that on education awareness is is
vital

627
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,830
I mean being able to communicate to
people and train them on certain things

628
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,800
look for

629
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,000
and this is where there's a couple
fundamental on flaws in a lot of I think

630
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,420
thinking in the industry

631
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,160
i'm david tell came out I think about
two years ago and said that education

632
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,540
awareness is completely useless

633
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,680
it doesn't provide any value in that we
can use it copper Snyder

634
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,740
said the same thing about six months ago
three months ago for months ago

635
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,370
that security I'm teaching individuals
arm about education awareness is useless

636
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,950
inch do through attrition or

637
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,780
in making things easier i've seen.
education one is working companies and

638
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,400
it absolutely does work i mean

639
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,170
I'd rather have 22,000 sensors my
company where just as one of them to say

640
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,990
hey I saw this is strange

641
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,430
for me to be able to gonna investigate
if I know what's going on actually gonna

642
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,430
media that issue and it's only well
defensively have against the step up

643
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,380
attacks

644
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,680
because you have a tax leverage our
individuals loves people

645
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,830
the worst kind they could possibly
imagine on it seems that they were due

646
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,800
back in the 90's

647
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,100
made easy just have you noticed evolve a
little bit on the technology side

648
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,230
so we have to have education awareness
for people to be able to do things in

649
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,930
it should be complex I mean our
education awareness with education

650
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,680
whereas when we are making governor
company

651
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,840
me know what's our education awareness
program in every company

652
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,420
online you know on online instruction
set like a

653
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,510
you hear spearfishing maxed is this

654
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,850
maxed to be actually ever read through
those

655
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,850
I have and I was I was a CS over 40,000
company might might my own education or

656
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,910
stop by Mike

657
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,220
Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next
the pain

658
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,300
no one's listening that known especially
its gonna our

659
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,460
I'm gonna a mega settlement our learn
about spearfishing when I have no idea

660
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,630
what that is

661
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,600
so it has to be a little bit different a
lot of people that she residents are

662
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,020
keeping you up-to-date frequently

663
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,270
you know reminding themselves like that

664
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,320
arm making security a friend right
nothing the Sears not the pain

665
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,490
are not a business process low-down just
ones that actually gone help you those

666
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,540
are the type of things that we're
talking about a dozen things that help

667
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,020
arm you know it into the date when you
talking to me can scan your friend

668
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,320
you should be the ones that are helping
the business and making more business

669
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,570
enhancement not anything else

670
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,820
and you know what's your sister doing
this your company actually no such that

671
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,550
change a little bit in a way that makes
things better

672
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,510
but I T becomes better on you know
anything is better

673
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,179
step to miss the crazy one for for a lot
of people on but it's not the one your

674
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,659
challenge

675
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,640
onto your sober on this one so all I'm I
can tell you can do it

676
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,070
when you're challenged is do not buy one
product for an entire year

677
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,520
not one not not one me maybe store in
New are you currently have al

678
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,950
all that thats line but don't buy one
product not one

679
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,140
and whether I see that is focus on the
basics of

680
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,260
basic stuff is work is what killing as
what's killing us now I mean

681
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,300
to me know how how most fantastic break
into organizations are almost hackers

682
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,910
break ins organizations

683
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,080
me know the statistics on that

684
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,170
it's not a PT not zero days I'm not
gonna burn is your dinner company

685
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,010
it's like default passwords sexy go
injection it's like stupid stuff that

686
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,770
we've been we've known for ten twenty
years

687
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,010
it's the stupid stuff it's killing us in
this industry is and is the basic things

688
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,290
that we're trying to fix

689
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,590
we overcome play are over arm complex if
I

690
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,600
entirely were made up arm the entire

691
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,779
no situation we continue to add more
most things that make an even more

692
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,910
complex

693
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,500
and we don't even set them you don't
focus on the basics of and so the one

694
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,830
your challenge is just that a

695
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,460
a review to say listen I'm a stop doing
something for year

696
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,840
and I'm gonna focus on the basics
because that's what I really need to

697
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,560
focus my cell phone and not invest in
something else

698
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,660
so the one your challenge is interesting
on ice in with a lot of companies but

699
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,830
that's that's kinda stuck to you

700
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:54,670
not not doing one thing don't buy
anything so consider

701
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,690
and set up for the basics range and the
basics are our exact with killing a sim

702
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,120
in were in the industry and this is kind
of our own creations what we've had it

703
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,110
done over a span of

704
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,650
I guess a period of five to 10 years we
made everything so complex

705
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,590
that we don't even understand it does
anybody have a risk management

706
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,030
program interest manager program other
local risk equations

707
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,510
risk equation simulate the funniest
thing ever arm you we have their prayers

708
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,620
Asian risk

709
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,620
but the funny thing ever because I have
no idea what my likelihood is there

710
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,350
something happening

711
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,270
do I know that someone from china is
going to have me at two o'clock in the

712
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:30,960
morning

713
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,100
from AZ earlier Spearfish have no idea
you can happen anytime

714
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,460
so we hear these things in in went
menino security programs failing

715
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,260
I just completely failing is when it
takes you 45 months to fix a critical

716
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,770
exposure

717
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,140
this paper things that we're dealing
with right now is how long it takes us

718
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,450
to fix the separate things in most
industries

719
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,859
so we've got more in a process more
things like that but

720
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,430
you focus on the basics not in the way
life II to categorize basics is

721
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,410
making simple symbols really easy for me
because I understand a lot accomplished

722
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,330
things mean

723
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,460
I guess I can I do with some stuff like
that but I'm not a smart person comes to

724
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,960
you

725
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,760
I guess what we consider security today
and so public a prior decisions three

726
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,170
things that I would focus on period in
in an organization is a three things I

727
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,300
just hit on this to be about it

728
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,980
is there so much work to do in security
we're never gonna be happy im never

729
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,430
gonna be

730
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,280
arms fishing in what we're doing these
two things at least I know I can control

731
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,030
somewhere she perform the first is the
external presence was just like the

732
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,840
highest likelihood of attack

733
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,940
the second is your user population which
we already talked about

734
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,340
the 30-share sensitive data I mean you
think about it

735
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,330
wire we all here in this room today let
me know why we're all here and wire and

736
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:34,960
security

737
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,030
and why would you why what your company

738
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:45,420
protect me right in of many why we try
to protect data

739
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,770
we don't just on one on one with its own
week

740
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,550
we've got a business exactly so the
reason why when security so that

741
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,250
that companies continue to generate
revenue right companies wanna make money

742
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,220
right and his any computer that doesn't
wanna make money

743
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,240
no your

744
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,150
everyone to you one sec nombre nonprofit
okay what he's going to be something

745
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,400
money the nonprofit right

746
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,880
still continue to have playtime so you
know we still won it worries more here

747
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,770
is so that our company can make money is
never anything else

748
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,480
yet another day if if there was interest
of the company losing money music

749
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,450
business we wouldn't have a security
team we wouldn't have people on funding

750
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,970
for security

751
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,930
a sec then day with a look at what's
generating revenue for the company with

752
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,770
those processes are with the data is and
where it resides at

753
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,780
and protect that there's no way we can
protect everything

754
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,550
it's not possible special in large
organizations I mean talking about a

755
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,040
company like

756
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,810
where I was at work in 77 countries all
over the place is no way them ever gonna

757
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,170
be alright I can't our company 12
percent

758
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,460
however I can see does end up having to
take these processes in a

759
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,370
have a pretty good assurance that they
can be protected those are things we

760
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,630
need to protect against insistence that
they don't bomb persons that mean we

761
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,990
need to focus on

762
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,550
and so you look at those three concepts
those three things we really want to see

763
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,020
action as the three things I want to do

764
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,440
um I talked about as a little bit but
but APT's is your knees are not the main

765
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,470
threat right now

766
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,330
and i'm sorry like it's what we hear in
the media what the buzz words are

767
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,470
it with all the companies are trying to
sell your a beauticians your days are

768
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,380
ridiculous

769
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,220
alright the chances you getting hit by
any BTR extremely minimum

770
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,850
and admitted to using some simple things
like spearfishing like it'll be read the

771
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,300
ABT one man even for

772
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,390
that honestly look like something from
like 1985

773
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,120
little babies an exact same thing like
the just you know they just a greater

774
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,690
operating system

775
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,820
same technique same attacks is just
something like way on a date I mean it

776
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,160
wasn't something sophisticated it wasn't
super

777
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,890
elite there wasn't a major happened it
was something that anybody could do you

778
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,230
messaging we're not we're not fighting
is your days yet

779
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,270
we have we're not even close to falling
as your days I read even

780
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,340
even beginning to tap that service at
all yet

781
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,490
we're still focusing on this most of the
small so that makes it easy for us to

782
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,500
breaking

783
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,490
and a are going in the second but you
for not doing the basics your for your

784
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,080
entire programs in Cremona media no
question about it

785
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,600
money into sections a fun one on an
attack on a bus a little bit but

786
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,009
the so much information happening every
day had even begin to separate

787
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,050
and I actually am an advocate of
anything like a seven I

788
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,070
summit began to get their products but
I'll I think the concept of a sim is a

789
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,870
good thing

790
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,020
some way to consolidate all the
information in organization for one such

791
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,310
a place you can enter to look at things

792
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,220
in a certain way now the way that minor
infection should work

793
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,280
you should look at how attackers
breaking a company right

794
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,850
to see hey aka and no I'm gonna most
attackers follow this methodology

795
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,590
uses this paper pattern we can start to
look at certain things and parents in

796
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,370
our infrastructure in organizations even
been compromised

797
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,590
I me sheens beginning and I'm missions
they have emissions

798
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,470
or ports Kansas is a as a basic thing in
that just simple stuff like that like

799
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,640
we r when I had a um when I was at the
the fortune 1000 company

800
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,340
I we had as we all over our web
applications all the firewall offered

801
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,930
are switches everything all piling into
it or Sam Wright

802
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,120
just stupid things that make your
complete sense limits so much noise like

803
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,950
for example

804
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:06,200
what does every tech to do as are trying
to do try to observe a complainer

805
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,359
to for sanity to be doing

806
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,130
14 went that would be most simplest
thing I just a port scan

807
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,370
K now the head rests on a permanent base
line you see okay I only allow 80 443

808
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,720
2553

809
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,920
was only four ports I will I'm outside
from your if anybody touches me on those

810
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,960
arm or not next is in touch me but you
know someone touches me and those those

811
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,359
those

812
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:31,890
other you know other than those for
ports we ban on for about two months

813
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,160
what happens

814
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,640
you know you the car but eighty percent
of a nice

815
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,000
you cannot eighty percent in noise just
producing Stephen simple like that

816
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,070
mainly focusing on twenty percent was
really out there makes a lot more

817
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,870
manageable to do just simple things like
that that

818
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:51,570
art no easy concepts or not doing if i
block a port scan for attacker it you

819
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:51,870
know

820
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,580
yes I can use towards an issue no start
looking at and other things becomes much

821
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,820
more complex and at that point on my
carried on a deal with it

822
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,340
and most of us are lazy so simple things
like that allow us to be able to talk to

823
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,650
know if you start putting things like

824
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,500
am in in what occasion for us honestly
bad thing tied an answer said if you see

825
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,800
a threshold hit on whatever kitchen fire
loss on every block him

826
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,010
this can take a while to get around in
coding on or whatever to prevent image

827
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,780
they have in their

828
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,380
simple things like that stopping Tom
effect is a funny story

829
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,260
we're all meeting and and our phones in
us are going off it was like for us in

830
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,680
this from my phones are going off in

831
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,060
my my ringtone if it comes from a
certain email address is something

832
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,930
different Thomas

833
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,210
it's what we call the I will support
from ok rap I

834
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:37,160
you know siren also we were all the
skinny oh crap siren

835
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,000
you know if we start looking at it in
what ways are having an attack on our

836
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,060
main website

837
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,200
and attackers trying to come thru SiC
want action and being very persistent

838
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,070
using some very sophisticated attacks

839
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,050
and did are on our semi that we had a
set up for automatic geographically

840
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,210
find out where persons and sent as part
did alert that we had

841
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,160
and happened to be a Panera Bread which
is a a chain of restaurants in R&R

842
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,180
in the United States that was right down
the road from us so right oh man so we

843
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,990
all get my car like

844
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,670
running for a car get the car were
driving down the spinner Brad have no

845
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,990
idea already doing serious damage it's
like

846
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,359
we'd like cm pic

847
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:13,530
night no idea but we're going down a
hole to beat him up I don't know either

848
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:13,830
way

849
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:18,490
but some we get down there and by time
we got three guns because we are deep on

850
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,660
black listed on

851
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,080
have won the guys at a new work debonair
were able to get the video surveillance

852
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,400
on other guy coming into are the actual
our place itself in a min give it is I

853
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,589
wore for team knew exactly who wasn't
picked them up

854
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:32,770
on so kinda cool way above my intention
or actually works on

855
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,760
i've seen pleading his case for most
people a pretty funny

856
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,930
%uh stuff I dispensation testing now

857
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,870
pressures testings what obvious to my
mother bias to my side house because

858
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,270
that's what I do for a living

859
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,950
however penetration testing today Sox
it's like the worst it's ever been. I

860
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,020
think in history a penetration test

861
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,920
the reason being is York monetize what a
penetration test is supposed to be

862
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,530
you rely completely on Tools so anybody
anybody on

863
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,260
ever got a pen test that's more than
fifty pages

864
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,620
few people yeah be actually read through
those

865
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,839
and as a whatever me stop at about age
30

866
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,280
but up you know things that like arm the
company's do for penetration tests are

867
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,170
basic is running for body scans

868
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,180
rights to the run in SS or paul sr an
expose us to make that

869
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,200
and from there they they find whatever
export the Metasploit or they go to

870
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,690
exploit the being defined what

871
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:28,120
bus was on its way to exploit that's not
a penetration test folks

872
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,410
mad at all do I really care that have
s.o.b to you are my cookies don't have

873
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,589
the Secure Flight on

874
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:37,930
who cares that will someone gonna do a
downgrade attack on Sobe to

875
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:43,510
any in ER in a a Starbucks that we live
right by my primary concern is right now

876
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,250
no way an alarm or other issues to deal
with in Sobe to you or

877
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,220
my Secure Flight I said I'm a cookie and
in what what penetration tests are

878
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,390
supposed to be what I'm supposed to be
designed to simulate an attack

879
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,950
when actual attack looks like is an
attack going to set us are blasting

880
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,310
necessary if you want to get into
organization

881
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:05,150
no no way it's not a penetration test
can do is just three things that are the

882
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,300
most important

883
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,780
one as you're talking to find sure right
pay yes the contraction or whatever

884
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,839
most importantly how well the agency
Response Team detect those attacks on

885
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,900
what stage

886
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,560
can be proven to be detected earlier on
make week we find out that

887
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,080
my stage we can just in hand some over
controls a little bit so we can attack

888
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,280
that attack at a very early stage in
prevent it from happening

889
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,410
assets want one thing the do things the
third thing

890
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,710
is where do we have fundamental flaws in
a security program

891
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,640
and pressure system do that better than
a risk assessment because it's actually

892
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,260
there

893
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,750
we can see that this process here
working it's great

894
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,690
Headingley test that we found deviations
okay I can get in through

895
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,770
now you might have an awesome as the all
seeing you doing security really well on

896
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,250
an

897
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,460
injected at this opera life cycle and
you have source go now see during those

898
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,330
testing

899
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,430
however we by third party after a
horrible

900
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,230
me to look at her party vigorous mentor
program is so this this is what we need

901
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,359
to focus on this is what we need a bit
to fit in so many do

902
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:03,540
at the end of the day that's going to
help you build and strengthen lot of

903
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,580
things that you do out there

904
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,230
on to really start to try to go out at
and so that's a penetration test versus

905
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,609
what we see today

906
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:13,830
itemization of automation same thing
running a technology

907
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:17,530
to care about this box in and ask
questions AB here have enough funding

908
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,740
for the security program

909
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,790
no I want okay to me even if people
first the program

910
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:29,210
no not knowing right

911
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,010
we don't have money right we don't have
enough people so why am happy we go by

912
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,760
my piece technology that introduces more
complexity

913
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,630
that we have the staff or we don't we
can to staffing for and just sits there

914
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,960
me going by the night next PC technology
me a permanent

915
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,130
we sit and wait you know people staff at
we can figure maybe for like six months

916
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,780
and then move on to the next one

917
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,880
you know it doesn't make any sense ahead
and informative

918
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,190
some recognition to you step away for
weeks just take a week off work and

919
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,980
obviously just now making their proof
first

920
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,150
just wanna take a week off work as they
said so on

921
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,089
but take a week off work and think about
we can do to go back to being basic

922
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:10,069
the simple stuff as a book to recommend
if you're interested scurry work

923
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:13,080
it's like my favorite book that I've
ever in my entire life I read it once a

924
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,940
month just to remind me of what I'm
doing

925
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,630
and simply different concept of
everything it's like basically

926
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,330
everything you taught right now

927
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,819
just taking from 11th right away and
then we then do that

928
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:26,359
like getting rid of 30 projections in
for your plans because it is don't work

929
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:30,180
things change so much in a three-year
period you know on just a really good

930
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,770
book

931
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,380
to do and then to understand and it's
not it's not technical nature its arm

932
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,910
swing by the Kaiser 37signals on being a
brat movie and Wales

933
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,310
but it's not technology book it's basic
business book behind you think about

934
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,600
sweeney

935
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,569
ons ago still no no cell phone and think
about how you can simplify security

936
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:51,830
thinkin and security lifetimes we sit
there and we get

937
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,950
over are more familiar with a lot of the
fires that happen every Sunday

938
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,060
to become very rapidly we have this fire
this far this far this far these things

939
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,050
we have to do

940
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,380
we don't literally focus on things that
are more strategy laid him as we need to

941
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,319
do

942
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:08,850
complexities what's killing us mean over
complex RISC equations and formulas

943
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,940
you know all the stuff for compliance i
mean let me know how much

944
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,290
are you know regulated data really makes
company it was just a PCI for example

945
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:19,500
are many in car or data ago yes and much
in retail

946
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,790
on his profile data typically make is
part of our business as far as actual

947
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,620
revenue for company

948
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,120
usually small a small percentage of our
overall business

949
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,680
my second year in a treat or something
like that and so focusing efforts on PCI

950
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,270
arrested in israel in anywhere else

951
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,569
are lastly know commit to this

952
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:41,730
easy for me to talk up here and can't
reach about in the I go hey it's going

953
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,910
to go back to the same routine every
single day

954
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,020
but if you going to change something you
make a little bit different to just

955
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,260
focus on the basics of

956
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,980
at the end the day it's gonna make a
pretty mean a better me things actually

957
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,460
on the more difficult for me to break in
which

958
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,470
right now as I mean funny arm

959
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,480
if I look back at me ten years ago
versus mean today

960
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,650
it's like the exact same thing nothing's
really changed as far as how I

961
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,850
TEKsystems

962
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,190
nothing's really changed as far as how I
go about it became easier actually

963
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,980
Ecotools are out there now just like
cheating me ever used our

964
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,280
talk or responder

965
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,870
may receive responder you get a chance
check it out it's me by spider labs

966
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:22,319
in know what's awesome us but it's it's
a glistening you plug into the network

967
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,790
you put in restraints type in Python
responder and IP address

968
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,920
it's a race condition so sister tries to
you on BF anything server prior to any

969
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,069
other thinking server

970
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,390
me just start sending anti lynch and
responses like you start getting a flow

971
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,359
of user accounts and passwords in

972
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:40,150
ridiculous they get stuff is made it so
much easier for us as attackers to break

973
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,089
into things

974
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:45,660
and I mean just like me know what a good
policy on hack

975
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,660
military ball Saginaw they got where

976
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,839
so funny story for a quick you don't so
anybody set

977
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,710
their Minister passwords or any service
passwords any account whatsoever through

978
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,089
Active Directory

979
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:01,200
its revolving but local accounts so that
the local admin account the heavy

980
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,530
machines you said any those who recall
seeing

981
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,770
so you can kinda centralizing make them
all kinda in the same so

982
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:11,190
most companies do and what happen is I
we live in a machine just like it's a

983
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,430
control thing you are gaining users
login

984
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,819
it goes to us a small share which
opposed oliver policy

985
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:20,440
when you get to be authenticated user to
do it so does nichols' over policy stuff

986
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,140
down

987
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,720
inside a group of the structure and in
those folders is a 50 groups that XML

988
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,200
inside the group that action of order is
what we call que pasa variable

989
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,880
in the KeePass available as an effort to
string and cut the string is often a 20a

990
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,339
a yes which is a key right yes is a good
guess and it was good

991
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:40,430
and see if this nigga to string a few
administrator password

992
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,930
the problem is Microsoft actually posted
the static is on TechNet

993
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,170
the entire world so you can go to candy
crop them on a map in any company wants

1001
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,500
it automatically trigger if you get an
answer for sho automatic worry all the

1002
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,160
domains that are in that the usual list

1003
