1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:09,570
good

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,939
hywell some

3
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:29,710
again welcome everybody on this talk is
gonna be a be technical

4
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,230
you can relate then you introduce and a
very basic principles

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,730
for offensive tools we designed

6
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,930
to do imaging poverty 100

7
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,000
from

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,530
so going to stop the basics good

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,360
us

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,070
many ways to did

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,049
we need said

12
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:06,710
good of

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,210
news his yes

resigns amid

18
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,460
phone for any good

19
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,159
but did

20
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,990
militarize because is every its

21
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,990
of if

22
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,819
just stated

23
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,450
modified is he said it's also

24
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,690

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,200
the these few should

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,490
make said

51
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,490
restrictions please red

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
is of games

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,120
good

54
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,710
if

55
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,210
should Hindi

56
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:16,210
should

57
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,990
up uncertainties

58
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,210
would

59
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,159
use his them

60
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:47,159
so few accepted

61
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,460
this huge descent

62
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Hughes good

63
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,520
is who went

64
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,080
we need this his rejected

65
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,349
controlled isn't for

66
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,710
good

67
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,710
piece of good

68
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,169
up

69
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,320
missions his whose

70
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,320
do we have of

71
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,140
his bed this just because we

72
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,409
only see good

73
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:00,740
if BC North

74
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,700
these those services bed

75
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,340
said

76
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,450
fish if

77
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:21,840
some said

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,770
discuss she said

79
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:35,770
his yes good

80
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,640
said

81
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,779
we the beautiful

82
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,779
to you he said wins

83
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:00,409
up

84
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,500
because it's for devices

85
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,750
full yes some

86
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,750
nice should

87
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,750
mint reflexes

88
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,750
good

89
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,459
me less we did

90
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:59,459
new E issues would

91
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:09,300
schools bed said

92
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,620
well just like them you'll say it we
developed

93
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,940
offensive tools on the first one is
called pheno and its

94
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,100
the core component of our solution the
idea of you know he's

95
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,390
to just injected service inside any
existing application

96
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,620
so that you can install the application
any phone and have to service available

97
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,130
disorders API available to interact with
the application internals

98
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,380
that's the very basics how artworks

99
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,520
some you have pheno the service that is
injected

100
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,270
you have to other main contains the
first one is cool gadget

101
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,839
it's actually service client

102
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,100
for the few sows API and Android phone

103
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,540
and into its system

104
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,700
disservice model provided no idea a
rating system

105
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,920
low as to provide pubic

106
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,330
AP ice on the phone

107
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,440
given an API definition that's what
finna do gadgets

108
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,070
only does on the opposite part it's the
client

109
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,760
that connects to defeat the service and
forward our request

110
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,970
from the network it's basically we have

111
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,010
the fuel service injected inside

112
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,250
the application the service

113
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,380
provides the service API over on the
phone missus

114
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,390
this API spillage and we have the
gadgets over

115
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,330
which is actually clean for the fuel
injected service and

116
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,660
to get its overall axe as a proxy so we
have developed

117
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,860
TCP based protocol to interact with

118
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,260
the gadgets over and every goal we make
to the gadgets over

119
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,730
is actually forwarded to the serious AJ
provided by FEMA

120
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,740
these grants as with the possibility

121
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,960
the ability to contact the internal

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,640
have intelsat the application JD from
the service

123
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,560
from any computer with internet the
network you just have to have to Texas

124
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,090
to the phone

125
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,220
so we do not need USB debugging we do
not need in USB cable

126
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,490
to remove the phone to a modification
weekend East other WiFi network

127
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,860
any wireless network we work we can do
this over you

128
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,860
on 30 operator

129
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,050
network very mobile operator network
that is very useful

130
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,550
for some security assessment so or
whatever

131
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,870
and because we can do this from her
computer

132
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,230
with very simple basic to beaufort based
protocol we can develop

133
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,750
any client to interact with the
internals of the applications and that's

134
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,460
what we did

135
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,550
we developed offensive tools offensive
libraries

136
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,790
written by from to interact with the
internals applications that are

137
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,920
installed in our phones

138
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,570
so that we can using only by fans group

139
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,890
interact dynamically with the
application in terms

140
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,910
that's gone says with the possibility to

141
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,990
scripps and modifications digging

142
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,240
and I'm anything you wouldn't

143
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,080
like to do we've your applications
internals so

144
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,530
I will try and give you a shot
demonstration to happen how

145
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,810
she actually works and how you would do
it

146
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,940
and a real application so here

147
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,250
on the right to have my phone it's a
real phone

148
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,910
it's not and

149
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,910
an emulator have it right here and I
will

150
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,430
interact with the phone very simply and
you can see well whatever happens there

151
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,850
and on the left they have a terminal I
have the client in start

152
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,580
the famous kept going and I talk to you
about the whole set

153
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,530
slavery in by from and very simple buy
from sell to interact with the

154
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,250
application

155
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,980
and the rights on the phone

156
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,140
Islands gadgets gadget is the proxy
server

157
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,390
getting that's the next two applications
that are injected with our finance

158
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,020
services

159
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,890
and provides us we've the network
service API

160
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,910
so I can just start some stuff gets over

161
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,470
and connect to its said for the purpose
of the demonstration we used

162
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,500
84 world because its temperature we do
not need wireless network

163
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,650
but you could use any network to connect
to the application is

164
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,860
just basic TCP connection so I think
it's

165
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,920
this book King I'm

166
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,300
I do the phone okay here I just
connected

167
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,030
my said that by which is the

168
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,220
I can play and to my gadgets ever

169
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,520
and the gadgets ever retrieved from
Middle Eastern application that are

170
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,150
injected with my finna service

171
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,690
I can now connect to any of these
applications and I have one very

172
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,750
interesting here

173
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,500
the gun that is going to do one that
will have a cat's

174
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,940
so I can just start

175
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,690
my first demonstration oh snap good

176
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,580
axle snap pressed on the application

177
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,680
so oh snap the title is wrong we know
that this issue anymore

178
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,930
we are attacking Paris so maybe we could
do something about that

179
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,970
first I can use my application and I
can't connect

180
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,350
to my application if the demigods argued
with me today

181
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,200
yes so now I have a cell by them to a
very simple

182
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,440
in its pure buy from again do whatever I
want to buy from

183
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,780
conscripts that and announcements great
with the the

184
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,880
back into I have a buy from sell

185
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,190
with a couple of variables already set
the most interesting Mon

186
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,250
iOS app at is erupting stems

187
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,590
my application there is a high level
it's obstruction

188
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,600
a couple of utility functions that we
provide

189
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,160
with the client already those utility
functions undeveloped

190
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,170
in the back from libraries and I have
one very

191
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,490
interesting you two things in switches
least activities

192
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,470
these activities just me with the
ability to least activity that announced

193
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,610
inside the application they have one
activity announced

194
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,120
right now which is the main activities I
can retrieve this instance

195
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,520
admin activity at my application I can
do whatever you want with activity a

196
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,660
good finish the activity to start the
application

197
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,290
I won't do that I could access the
activity title

198
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,030
just like any variable in by them but
what they just wrote

199
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,130
act that entitled is actually sent over
the network

200
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,690
interpreted by the gadgets ever for
ready to defeat the service

201
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,780
and executed inside the jar that
tradition Sun

202
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,240
I actually access to property of my
application which is which is launched

203
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,960
from the film

204
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,230
with some very basic by from naked said
the title

205
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,270
I could go some inference inside the
application a good said the title

206
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,460
rights nefesh my activity

207
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,460
said new title is displayed in provided
with name

208
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,030
if my application with the little string
and missed

209
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,990
and the screen maybe we could guess that
their own there's some frustration

210
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,080
technique used

211
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,610
insider may be inside the application

212
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,030
stern's obfuscated and that's what we
can

213
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,080
and I'm assets by

214
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,480
just accessing the night could have the
applications I disassembled

215
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,540
the application in here is this mess
modified

216
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,890
smileys the one of the low-level
languages

217
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,510
for all that they could debate good that
is executed and Android phones

218
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,700
and here I can see and if it skated
string

219
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,170
in the famous last named come that is
when the team won the diff

220
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,270
maybe etc maybe it could reverse the
algorithm

221
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,750
using usual reverse engineering
techniques but maybe also

222
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,340
I could use some 2x inside my education
to access this class

223
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,750
and to make its do is get the street
from me

224
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,100
because you differences in did you guys
get into the rhythm

225
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,220
is already implemented in segregation so
I could

226
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,080
get the class from phenol

227
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,330
simply provide it with the name a class
up

228
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,500
Jamal that a few

229
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,060
and it would refer you to a subject
inside

230
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,000
said I can get the class object and I
can interact with the class like any

231
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,920
other Democrats

232
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,390
ICANN fee for instance see what
properties it has

233
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,140
does have this famous drink released
which is a skated

234
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,810
and also has get method the GET method
is the fixation method

235
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:48,160
I can simply good I do not need to
reverse

236
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,750
devastation and tourism is simply needs
to use the application to be from me

237
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,110
so that's very useful when reverse
engineering in you

238
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,560
and again at halftime

239
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,680
maybe we could go on with some more
interesting

240
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,850
demonstration which is more about to
emerging that reverse engineering

241
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,950
the reverse engineering no I had

242
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,570
some sites with her and I'm very sorry
an

243
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,370
the principal have injected the an
application with the

244
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,750
from the service is very basic you just
take the application

245
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,160
you disassemble it you take the few
services disassembled

246
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,050
you merge the two you patch your way
into making it work

247
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,970
there are a lot of dirty hacks and say
they're and you resemble the whole thing

248
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,150
and you get injected a petition that's
very basic

249
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,640
sorry about the states they will just
skip them and let them %um

250
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Anna work with his two imaging it's good

251
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:01,179
point

252
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,459
sorry well I'm going to present

253
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,869
above consent redevelop is free no
because

254
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:11,349
FINA kum be used as a reverse
engineering tool as a

255
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:15,629
PF shoulders but it can also be used to
create tools

256
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:19,320
and this is another another aspect of
this tour this is very interesting

257
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,119
because

258
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,149
weekend use some Java application that
whichever

259
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:26,700
and addition created for the 100 got
from

260
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,659
but also used dis mmm the subjugation

261
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,749
know the to be remote-controlled

262
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:37,369
between began finest and create at the
gym if rosa

263
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:40,559
a you know the true to first I V
assistance

264
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,839
so you for presenting your the technique
Bigg ass

265
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,269
I'm going to just a maker special
presentation of what

266
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,079
I feel is RvR means interactive voice
response

267
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,469
so it's oh so running let undergoes

268
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:57,899
communications voice communications over
the

269
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:01,519
the fun to talk and it provides a bus
service to customers generally

270
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,859
and I mean if you are ever in answering
service provided by Ateco

271
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,200
it is and I feel service am

272
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,669
on the interaction between your
smartphone or your phone

273
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,649
and the audio is based on was accorded
him if

274
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,649
the gym if either me for two Sen

275
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,579
koon commands mother the phone system
nitsa

276
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,029
based on the joint on read if you can
see system and the

277
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,019
its generous supporter but lot of phones
furthering

278
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,209
the gym if consistent sending large
amount of

279
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:38,149
data did you miss sequences that is over
there from this work

280
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,450
you know that too see how the I feel
service

281
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,309
reacts to address and treated

282
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,409
usually for years

283
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:52,289
those specific are not testing systems
to assess the security

284
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,249
up for de Sario but its renewed effort
ever

285
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:59,409
its ghost a those not of dollars or
Euros

286
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:03,929
I'm you have many well-known are you up
to soon testing system such as new

287
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,409
maneuver Torkham muster

288
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:09,239
which gusted up in its are also require
specific

289
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:14,079
other or because you have to two-room by
some Jason gateways in order to

290
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,329
to create a lot of connections or just
i've government development

291
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:20,789
lines through it very nice the process

292
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,869
so it's it costs using Android phones

293
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,809
is cheaper because 100 from other are
very affordable

294
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,159
is also open source sorry Jim develop
own own

295
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,539
system more on testing system I'm

296
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,529
on these phones may be tweaked 2002
stick

297
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,359
so it's %uh something very very tricky
to

298
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,460
the to design and implement met

299
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,859
we did basically the owner

300
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,889
are 100 based ago testing system these
days

301
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:59,239
on and notification when you on the
phone inside the subjugation

302
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:02,450
we have already injected life in the
service that their

303
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,009
make its a is eighty remote-controlled

304
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:09,369
am re also created pay some scripts

305
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,429
got it in the first that uses their
gadget proxy

306
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,929
and the fins service through commitment
to education and then

307
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:21,669
drive the DTMF further web

308
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:25,489
this is not very easy to create this
kind of system because

309
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:28,619
your need to have a the real

310
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,379
low-level access to the phone because
only the from the tradition

311
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:36,619
installed on your 100 system is able to
communicate we ve baseman

312
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:39,759
so you after first would you on your
phone

313
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,200
in order to have this access it's not a

314
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,009
we're thankful I think am on being able
to install a lot of occasions

315
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,159
but there gore here too there need

316
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,489
matter with your phone is just to be
able to assign

317
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:58,239
in application to create assistant
application

318
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:03,159
Ventre really drop inside the system
applications directory

319
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,959
seagrams you have to patch ATG ATT's a
plugin for Eclipse

320
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:11,249
maybe there are some developers all over
that

321
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:14,379
uses use this but again and then

322
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:18,179
the Eclipse ID and this plugin

323
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,379
a have some rooms lead deny

324
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:25,059
access through combat 100 internal that
everything

325
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:28,200
these myspace is used through

326
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,519
a access a lot of into classes

327
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,950
that are not intended to be used by 100
if no posts up I GTG

328
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,769
its its is mandatory because get you
have to remove the room

329
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,499
is through stating that we do not have
access to this namespace

330
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,659
so just like that unified we can get
access to

331
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,539
in democracies so the goal is to create
a system integration with access to it

332
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:54,559
on the closest to

333
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,479
get Nexus to the phone in the basement
you know the truth they have some

334
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,229
numbers

335
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,369
and sanity in if we also need to build

336
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:05,589
and read the job of specific fide a good
thing

337
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:09,229
holding Donna gus is because if we do
not the do dis

338
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:13,319
read the implication we not be able to
communicate with your internet classes

339
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,099
and also US two act into the phone
application

340
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:21,319
your I can be the in into the further
because it means

341
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:26,149
the tree I have to room application East
Side the process

342
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:29,659
over the phone application which is the
basic iPhone

343
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:32,679
mmm applications done on 100 that

344
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,859
application is responsible of creating
communications

345
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:40,039
their numbers its mmm and sewing

346
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,309
and eventually just got back sorry

347
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:46,399
and the project additional 100 and Reema
by

348
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,569
my phone so first of all we have to
create a system application

349
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:53,749
we need to import in Java a lot of
classes

350
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:57,509
and especially conduct 100 into the
Tiffany

351
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,929
got everything because 3 need some
places like fun class

352
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:05,519
and fuck from victory class

353
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,190
just means 10 Jeeva really be able to
retrieve

354
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,239
for instance and we also need to modify
the

355
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:17,399
angry manifesto excitement fight in
order to win make the application

356
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:21,259
running into have fun process

357
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:25,729
if Reid do not if you if you don't do
this

358
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:29,909
rem not be able to refer to get access
to the phone

359
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:33,739
was we have a phone instance began you
the day I miss that too

360
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:37,969
by a number us and to send DTMF we also
ever

361
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,159
over quick act would good conduct ike

362
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,809
a from the run don't get the active goal

363
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,269
by using a good for one goal method and
then

364
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,749
youth this in the gym if knowing on the

365
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:55,289
get phone the result is a good for
mister to San

366
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,440
using dis we r ever to simulate

367
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,829
a user missing Britons are you for on
them on the phone and then

368
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:05,909
Sen commands to the audio system

369
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:10,109
we are also able to recall the as young
their command social conversation be

370
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:13,309
hmm Sangster under a two-game

371
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,489
which provides are be very useful class
gourmet jelly colour

372
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:21,219
major credit can be used to adjust a
save

373
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:24,979
all we qot the concession to refine with
3gpp

374
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:29,339
fight for Mike but there are some
limitations to this weekend or the good

375
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,549
they don't make

376
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:34,809
re re noted air the at the gym if we
sent

377
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:37,829
through disagreement I've your system

378
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:44,359
bedridden get the the result

379
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:47,369
even through the trees the diffusion you
need to sign yet

380
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:50,399
with us same private key yours to sign

381
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:53,919
all the system applications and this is
why you need to read your phone

382
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,399
in order to is thought this a the
gennifer

383
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,869
because if you do not sign your
education with a exact

384
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:05,239
for over two years by the the reason

385
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:08,539
people designed to run your your
education real

386
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,719
not be recognized this as a system
integration and

387
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:14,819
can appear on your phone so this is the

388
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:17,819
expiration there waiting for us with
instead

389

sir on often do then is just re month

390
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:24,159
the roots you know to push yet addition
the system

391
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,869
up territory once in three months you
was the one

392
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:31,399
this so application will be available on
your phone and then

393
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,239
you can use it with Finn

394

is is in addition is the diff

403
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,250
if to to

404
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,860

just does my ans

414
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,890
his bread I'm is

just my said

417
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,360
by User the the street

418
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,930
also reveals yonder decisions

419
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,800
should

420
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,900
whether it was was went for the

actually the

422
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,030
would do it was good

423
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,240
these system

424
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,770
the decision solution

425
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,650

unstable from

451
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:52,520

some some his of

471
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,880
saw something like that this is interest

472
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,670
where this is their shows showed

473
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,350
to his don't

474
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,500
system using few as a rigid

475
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,900
good where

476
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,950
gusts up

477
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,200
this is something I wasn't

478
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,590
well and I'm not sure we have much time
left

479
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,830
but we have very last

480
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,830
demonstration and

481
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,330
to illustrate one of the most powerful
features the

482
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,460
into tools we developed and the

483
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:18,800
we've gotten well what use is there are
other imaging system if we consider

484
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,160
games with it so we started thinking
about

485
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,140
what way we could try and write some

486
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,910
software to the games and we remember
our

487
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,460
and I'm are young

488
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,870
game Erin life and sitting with the

489
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,550
famous action replay and PlayStation in
a tried and developed something similar

490
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,300
and the Android system using finna to do
that

491
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,290
we developed and I'm actually your
additional service

492
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,390
anarchy we are now able

493
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,760
inferno to write some data could on the
computer side

494
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,040
to write some by some good on the
computer side to wrap

495
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,750
all these data sings to combine the
death occurred

496
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:08,420
to send the binary over network and to
inject binary code inside the

497
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,630
application dynamically

498
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,990
so the application is running and Wintek
dresses winter

499
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,900
made good inside the application
dynamically over network without having

500
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,350
to restart

501
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,910
anything that's the Collier with the
reuse them

502
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,920
you know so it's very simple you have
the Devas source you compare it to any

503
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,540
began a

504
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,580
and your to the beautiful its

505
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,800
imported as a democrats begins to see it
that's

506
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,820
the democrats you get a micro instance
and you have all the

507
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,050
pheno by from its actions too many
create your own

508
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,440
new macro instance there

509
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,730
we developed macro that acts just like
the action replay

510
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,910
back to the base station time how did we

511
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,970
menace to develop such thing its

512
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:56,160
very basic actually mmm we use

513
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,140
a simple Java class I will not

514
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,020
could say you deserve a class for the
developed

515
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,470
its nothing there its when

516
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,349
distance microns for me we developed
Java class

517
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:17,950
which is here play the top this java
class

518
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,980
does one thing and does it well it just
bruise

519
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,840
the internals have difficulties in from
one point it takes

520
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,680
the it has very simple functions done
trying to read the goods already

521
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,990
but it just takes one variable won't
tell you

522
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,430
and tries ambrose all the attributes
recursively

523
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,810
until it finds some attributes that have
that very

524
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,849
its stores the references to those
attributes

525
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:45,380
and then you can filter this least

526
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,619
attributes that had the initial value
given the new value just like you did

527
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,160
connection to play remember you just set
an initial value

528
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,670
it grabs for you to least both places in
the mirror that that you said

529
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,590
Anna in time entertain you give

530
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,300
and the new police to seize them into a
few turn this least the first new places

531
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,250
and knurled search to do one or two or
three more races

532
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,450
that match W your money fame

533
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,800
this is this works very well with gaming

534
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,080
get some with games for instance

535
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,200
was fast starts my gadgets ever

536
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,520
and start a very simple game called
jewels maybe you know the principles

537
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,740
no I don't no

538
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,800
pins they mandate

539
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,430
no

540
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:44,520
please

541
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,520
King I'm gonna try again

542
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,130
yes ok so I have many

543
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,809
very simple game with your fences sounds

544
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:02,940
and the principle is simple just make
points

545
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,359
have the right school and win the game
will try and hack

546
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,630
our way into the game using finna so I
have already injected

547
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,030
the game application with the FINA
service so I can interact with its

548
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,609
mmm maybe it's listed I have to fill the
pot

549
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:24,290
again this home this forum

550
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,000
so sorry me

551
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,250
that's not the right one yes I have the
stuff applications and this one

552
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,950
is and I'm image games the jewels that
go when

553
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,240
ordered his game the tools and I will

554
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,240
run pheno inside applications now I have
a cell

555
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:51,690
that is inside the application and I
have my application they can for

556
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,500
instance

557
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,470
least the activities and if everything
is right I have two activities

558
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,839
inside a fictional 121 which is due
activity

559
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,260
in it which is the one that's paid going
on the screen so I could interact with

560
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,790
these

561
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,000
activity that's not my point right now

562
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm trying to cheat at the game and
whatever you would like to modify

563
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,020
goes to score of the game a good reverse

564
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,549
the application unfortunately the bike
has been

565
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:23,220
piece kate is a Canon reverse it very
simply

566
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,470
I coolest all the interest rate them one
after another

567
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,250
that would not work very well I will
instead use Metreon

568
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:37,250
so I I can

569
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,750
in brought my replay class with which is
the bay from rapper

570
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,099
was on the democrats I just said you
earlier

571
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,720
I'm proud that one and they will
instantiate

572
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,380
that's one

573
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,710
I will give it the applications ten so
we can start searching

574
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,049
from the application would and I will
give it the current value disco

575
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:03,079
of course I will not start with 0
because

576
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,160
download have derived using sign the
petition Constanza

577
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,730
concern and if we give me maybe even 100
200

578
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,660
if it was I will start with some non
you'll score I'm very lucky

579
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,910
help them I tell the replay module that
the guns going to stem

580
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,569
in it will search for me the variable
inside evocation

581
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:26,849
whose value stem takes and

582
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:29,930
time because it goes the Conservancy the
default

583
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,960
they've is 3 so it will take all the
attributes

584
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,290
the application then for every
attributes go inside attributes have

585
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,000
defeated

586
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,470
and so on three times texaco seconds

587
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,670
and it it does it very well because it
has in the world the search to nineteen

588
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,869
entities I have nineteen attributes
inside my petitions

589
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:52,109
we saw all named him which have
currently

590
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:55,460
every damn I will modify to score

591
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,380
and for instance here main store

592
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,940
is a 20 so I will tailor a plane with
you that the news guys twenty

593
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,369
in it will scan again all these
attributes

594
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:10,799
and there are the search two entities so
that two entities

595
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:14,650
with up his Katie names that had
dividend initially

596
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,609
and now have given you twenty 20 I will

597
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,770
play their last time to be sure that
these two entities

598
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,910
are the right ones so they can score
least 30

599
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:30,109
well

600
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:33,150
there are still there are still two
entities may be just two entities

601
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,510
are both this core I'll try and modify
them

602
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,650
so I have very simple said something to
me failed to score

603
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,839
I'm not sure which for would fit

604
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:47,799
this function do the that

605
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:54,799
maybe it's just refresh problem right

606
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,210
for the conclusion let's try and put her
in Paris

607
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:12,210
and that's got ever articles I hope
snuff

608
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,759
yes we're number one

609
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:28,090
here

610
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,490
corner we're not number one I should
have but more

611
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,720
sorry you that's it

612
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,869
and I'm not sure

613
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,970
you have many questions but maybe you do

614
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,520
and non all not to love them a stupid so
please good shot if you have

615
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:53,510
immigration yes

616
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,180
good

617
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,340
yet you

618
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,640
inside issue

619
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,540
he you could

620
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,780
inject inside the phone met and you
would have to modify DPK education

621
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,760
to modified the bytecode inside
different territories

622
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,530
and to do that you would need with
access of course but we could develop a

623
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,450
Ninja Tune

624
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,560
application that that's the injection
given the root access but

625
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,990
it's not malware we developed and

626
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,859
being that my way we can insecticide
applications because the Android

627
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,080
security malone's quite

628
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:43,080
big enough

629
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,850
while if no numa questions

630
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,100
just know that everything we developed

631
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,890
is free its diverse free software and
you know very welcome to contribute

632
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,050
too few no so here are the gate had bath
and just ask this

633
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,290
will do marriages to give you right axis
to do with the stories

634
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,410
we know that it's very tough to a sieve
feel free to contribute

635
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:17,410
here

636
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:21,700
father

637
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,430
first the gym emphasized re-unite

638
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,770
yes lifted

639
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:36,770
you have various up

640
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,810
fewer forward
