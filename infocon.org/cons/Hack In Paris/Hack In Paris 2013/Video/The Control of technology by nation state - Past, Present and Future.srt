1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,879
we believe good

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,950
for sure sorry I have new people new

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,259
return here soon have to so I will try
to

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,920
be Ferguson on the slights so I would
like to present you

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,300
in well some when the V when doves a

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,490
a new vision sorry love I G security in
sp3

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,760
cryptography and to talk about

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,849
what was in the past prison terms

9
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,890
the recent news was a priest UK's

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,770
are other interesting in this context
and of course what will be the future

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm regarding information

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,270
information security to the first
question

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,250
he's do just ice you that's the question

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,850
is it possible to enable put on security
for everyone

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,510
of course the question is the the answer
isn't new

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,350
as the story maybe because in fact you
have to deal with national security

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,620
issues the for the dominions and

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,540
of coke economic warfare are into than
aspirin in 1989 but

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,830
the cold war's been replaced by when is
a former war

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,380
which is economic warfare to in fact

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,670
in this complex is very important to
keep in mind that

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,960
we cannot leave without control the
program he's

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,170
who is enforcing his control I would
like to

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,280
sure you a few example

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,619
among many meanie was a Afghans are many
many

26
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,470
the information about back doors and
soon to the first one

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,030
were speaking we are hearing you very
much about

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,149
back doors in weather aliens it the
equipment

29
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,340
well but probably

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,899
lace about

31
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:57,570
Cisco mcdougal's the program

32
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,320
is we by which I want to be money toward

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,549
unfortunately in phones with no longer

34
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,250
I get Taylor would too we have to choose
between Chinese and

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,940
US and for me it's very disturbing but

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,230
many menus are examples for example

37
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,360
Canada and equipment

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,879
back door to a little

39
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,910
I remember that Canada is was it a
founding member of the issue network

40
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,580
is Owen more recently Microsoft

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,810
an when Microsoft

42
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,280
my boat Skype very soon

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,010
is a problem hope meeting from those
arrived

44
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,980
arose FBI

45
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,989
and back doors on the internet service
ease but it is a long history as we were

46
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:53,870
going to see

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,120
Facebook when Google

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,159
recruit people of I ranking I cranking
of these are from the Dumbo

49
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,209
to but never tell from the Department of
Defense

50
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,080
in the United States for more recently

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,349
and they say ends a priest project but
Brees just

52
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,450
well you knew ever to in a very long
series of

53
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,940
with such project who

54
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,780
Windows Phone more cynthia does is he c
2011 The

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,760
well some very intriguing features

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,629
technical features in it reach your

57
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,620
devices the attack by

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,890
or friend are gains easy

59
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,150
using Facebook and the fact that we have

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,049
very famous operating system everywhere

61
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,780
years a bridge project you that you have
the least

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,780
I'm sure it is not was a complete list

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,330
but you have here's a project

64
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,689
is a graphical user interface but you
can your project can you go whether it

65
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,900
be good to be a receive

66
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,009
so late do it was rename DCS 10 so than

67
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,280
less aggressive but can fight seen the
beginning of the early

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,570
2000 although internet service ease
driven by the US

69
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,190
where money toward you are is a
graphical interfaces

70
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,570
people are in to steer also the
technical

71
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,930
technical description means in

72
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,600
technical documents to in fact

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,270
before 12 there was no control it was
possible to sell

74
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,860
group to machine for a super I do know a
Swedish company

75
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,580
but of course we the any man was purple

76
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,889
and soon you nope worries the story it
was

77
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,910
abuse that it was necessary to go
through security

78
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,310
and after will want to

79
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,990
the actually very and above the forties

80
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,759
in fact lot of control have been put in
place and then forced

81
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,000
of course these export Co it was

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,169
just called export control as beginning
it was totally impossible to sail

83
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,759
sensitive technologies for him into the
Soviet Union

84
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,780
more recently to do we have the rises
tourism

85
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,550
very early

86
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,400
of 2000 but in fact

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,210
during the end of the world to alton
many controls

88
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,190
have been put in place to what you have
here a lot of

89
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,030
I mean User Terms that brody means

90
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,640
many things to you I would like to
explain to move them

91
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,880
the main problem as a prison dying that
the control

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,540
is no longer enforce only by the natural
state

93
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,740
to protect their own cities in we have
control

94
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,540
performed by only a very few number of
meat Nationals

95
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,830
we all knows the names an well

96
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,960
do you accept that someone else except
your country

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,560
pretend to protect your privacy

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,740
protect your life protect you from each
and of course

99
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,940
your company's it is a national security

100
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,000
and economy issue and he's not a simple
program

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,130
to I will focus of course

102
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,340
in cryptography so I say of course
because in fact

103
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,110
it is a more the you stretch example in
fact whatever may be the security

104
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,570
device or mechanism you can consider you
have control you

105
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,840
cryptography as a very the very
low-level

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,890
but in fact the

107
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,820
it is very easy to broadens debates
because if you have a strong algorithm

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,410
it is a scene room the on logo on the
will be per

109
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,249
INF to

110
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,069
in fact you can do a lot of attacks do

111
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,020
outwardly those software review you can
even were at the regulations and

112
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,039
standards level

113
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,129
and so on so do not focus only

114
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:13,060
from the are more door there are many
many all the things to take into account

115
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,479
so just

116
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,650
I would like just to recall some basic
facts

117
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,240
the you have to kind of quick to refuge
symmetric cryptography

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,219
which which is based on information
theory mean that you ever

119
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:32,310
a lot of CQ beginning of security proof

120
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,599
but I soon as rather large pieces I
speeches 23 impossible to move it into

121
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,479
analyze to will systems you have more

122
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,599
internal states than the

123
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,599
particles in the universe for of course

124
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,159
more than any computer that would store
eat and

125
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,560
persist I see me too good to go for you
which is very famous by know what you

126
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
knew and his name

127
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,129
but the quiche in fact we have
absolutely no proof

128
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,969
both security it is well above the BBQ
slur most famous

129
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,430
mathematical problem which is open still

130
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,449
open there is one million don't know we
will be able to solve it

131
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,110
it means in fact the problem is be-

132
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,979
equal is P equal to NP in

133
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,870
more in from your terms does

134
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,879
difficult terrain released or not

135
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,899
it is an open problem but all the
security

136
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:36,519
a symmetrical to these days that's
assumption and which is very

137
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,709
injures demanded to see surprising that

138
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:44,000
nowadays when you are unable to prove
that insecurity

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,019
something it is a preferred securities
as a saint if you're a guy I am very

140
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,899
surprised that kind of argument

141
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,720
especially when dealing with national
security issue

142
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,279
so honestly we don't

143
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,959
have any security proof regarding

144
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,709
a symmetric cryptography so

145
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:11,750
the aim is to present some vs big

146
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,740
of course heavily to you need time but I
would like to make you

147
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,490
I think open a different other issues
and

148
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,750
the last name is it there's team
sometimes questioned

149
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,310
more interest in then answers because
most of the nation state will

150
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,310
won't give you the answers you have just
to rub into the official

151
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,399
and unofficial the condition to make
your own mind

152
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,540
I've worked extensively on that point
during

153
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,970
on those on those programmed during my
early 20

154
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,050
me twenty years so they would like to
make some sort of some rich but of

155
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,490
course

156
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,040
you are free to think differently so

157
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,510
first from not in the in the world will
too

158
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,440
around 1975 to recall its was

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,519
during za Caldwell the

160
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,880
in fact it was clear that it was
necessary to prevent

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,160
the spread but sensitive technology buts
its easy technology is not new to Lee

162
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,269
cryptographic algorithm it is GPS bring

163
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:22,310
GPS but for a very long time limited you
have to be communications

164
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,610
equipment returns where even put
computers

165
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,110
and so on so in fact the project was kam

166
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,519
which was the first intentional
agreement we need to spread of

167
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,120
technology

168
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,500
and very surprising into unity cities
was forbidden for example

169
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,310
to export computers and secure computers
difference

170
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,300
during the seventies francois to
reconsider the rogue nation by US

171
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,959
that's why the japanese

172
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,140
try to develop night in iti in
supercomputing

173
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,279
reserve 32 Beach but for a very long day
with it was a green from

174
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,920
to buy but great supercomputer and
either

175
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,350
even as a process Olivo some instruction
where

176
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,260
it was not possible to buy them when out
could you were

177
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,870
it was possible to adjust immunity
deviation for his aboard the book

178
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,390
couldn't

179
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,540
mmm instruction gold

180
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,670
the number one in the world very
sensitive

181
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,250
instruction when you do attorneys well
to invite

182
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,000
you have many many fact and we'll come
back to the quick to add cases and you

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,649
will see

184
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,410
what we can think about these then next
face

185
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,559
which you have you it was a phase when
the

186
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,089
doing reach is a and tourism was rising

187
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,790
and of course it was the end of Coldwell
a room

188
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,939
the and of course the classical back
door i mean for his will mathematical

189
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:53,670
back door

190
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,540
and implementation big deal will no
longer possible

191
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,649
so nation-state

192
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:04,329
played a very simple to very simple
principle

193
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:10,640
never put all all your eggs inside by
ski deviancy find your approach

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,920
so in 1994 I will speak you

195
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,720
again about that possess an argument as
replays a calm

196
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,850
enlarging the control and making
monetary

197
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,100
is the is a application each signing my

198
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,640
members n a number of projects

199
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,260
as a presenting with the of mean with
beginning

200
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,290
a proposed pres but priest very

201
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,610
early event out with the cut this
project

202
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,350
you see 18 with the region 1982

203
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,809
discourse you can read these groups is
very interesting

204
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,630
you either evolution above the is a
World Trade

205
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,500
agreement we make small battery to

206
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,390
up a new market reason produces group
tours

207
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,029
issue and the european community was
very concerned about the fact that

208
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,390
something as a vigil will look at. in
England

209
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,640
a member of the European Community

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,140
and usually meets enters a game

211
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,709
and they'd say okay we are also more
than Peter G

212
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,860
well very I'm me to be joking because in
fact there is a

213
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,980
which officially was born in 1977

214
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,390
in fact I have your resent to you

215
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,829
document has been published is to
because you have the

216
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,630
has been at least invented

217
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,029
forty years ago by baeza Billups

218
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,390
for the Department of Defense in the
United States

219
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,809
so that's why was rough getting it
should be maybe

220
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,250
modified I remember was it at crib to

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,949
92 which is a when the biggest
conference in Quito I remember to reason

222
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,020
RAM station

223
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,240
clash very violent clash between you
more

224
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,410
from the Electronic Frontier Foundation
and Brian snow for the inside you will

225
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,209
say okay

226
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,480
we need even saddam hussein yeah

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
as right to have a very strong agreed to

228
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,819
way not al Qaeda to sing

229
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:20,520
and they are not as good as a player I
was a younger but this page was very

230
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,630
surprised

231
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,490
so in fact at the end of these phase in
fact the Straits

232
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,730
move on from few soviet soviet

233
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,120
the of communist countries to any people

234
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,270
students guy with it with internet
connection

235
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,360
in the computer that's why the control
have to

236
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,250
to be diversified globalization face
from 2001

237
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,519
and around 2012 so there isn't

238
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,250
in fact the we r varies

239
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,670
strong rise above the tourism

240
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,829
and the and emerging countries when you
reach some

241
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,589
US document it is clear that for the US

242
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:08,329
emerge a good tree are some sort of
economy terrorist

243
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:12,410
and we and the minute Nationals the
private sphere

244
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,709
become becomes the new dimension

245
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:21,050
the poor were is in multinationals

246
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,699
you either love names

247
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,709
and with his interest in that there is
some as some

248
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,270
project you know dude to modify some

249
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,360
for some quick to defeat from the last
I'm very surprised because

250
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,939
in France for example with okay quick to
refuse be free

251
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,600
so you add you hadn't around 2004

252
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,839
between of freedom for cryptography

253
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,459
you reach freedom means Verity as a
prison time you only

254
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:54,319
up when a gruesome a yes tooth 256

255
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,600
well its miss the freedom its humans

256
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,799
and of course you as a rising networks
of computers

257
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,659
of ruin everybody's I'm not sure that
aldrin everybody's

258
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:10,150
are Ling to developers incumbent

259
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,309
of lack of knowledge to be you is is the
best way to

260
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:19,309
I do truck door is just to say 0 may
differ about very bad

261
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:25,829
by Microsoft now but it seems twenty
years

262
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,549
I think disease issue do change before

263
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:34,480
so but different was our speaker Subas a
statement where

264
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,110
from 2001 with many clinton project a
very recently in France for example zip

265
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,970
see

266
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,049
project or is a route see you or when
the

267
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,829
we just for you and we see that in fact
it there is a strong need

268
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,959
to work some different features inside

269
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,169
or appurtenances them to any bruises the
actions nation-states

270
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,480
pleased in the regions and once again is
the tricky

271
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,500
because I want to be birthday I want my
family to be pretty

272
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,030
I want that Thrones is protected me not

273
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,789
United States or China for different
interest

274
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:15,059
and of course very interest in Daman
soon it's a rise in the end of the

275
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,939
eighties

276
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,000
other occur phenomenon when I means a
rise

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,220
big writes it was of course you
originated

278
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,459
are the sooner but in fact

279
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,429
the borough's I couldn't mention enters
a game is very surprising Indies

280
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,090
it is easy way the last phase we are
currently

281
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,919
in it is a young face the lawyer

282
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,740
in fact don't who trains

283
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,250
books no more the g20 societies to
consider a citizen as a potential

284
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,620
criminal

285
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,860
and everything he's built in order
around this conception

286
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,289
so you have into to a property mechanism

287
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,150
you knew all those names you are button
twirls

288
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,390
and I think that a able his furry
stronger

289
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,600
in lieu didn't Korean techniques

290
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,220
the software patents were standouts

291
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:23,220
the License Agreement honestly you
should read your license agreement

292
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,070
I don't see that you unless being
totally drinkin you would accept

293
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,890
that you are accepting by insane
software read your license agreement

294
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,549
industrial agreement to turning into
monopolies

295
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,970
I'm very terrified about the Caesar of

296
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,480
the Microsoft and Intel about to

297
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,669
UV to mechanism

298
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,750
will be possible to install the new
spree

299
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,279
we that would be in sin before by
Microsoft

300
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,350
it is an open question

301
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,809
cyber community regulation and so on and
of course speak especially inference

302
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,020
the demonization of actors the recent
cases

303
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,380
of you been book wasn't are very
illustrative you sir

304
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:16,580
respect so that is a pretty

305
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,020
in fact you have many many control and
all g20 countries

306
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,559
have enforced the school it is the
interesting for example

307
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,100
you at this link Lusso to slay will be
available to you

308
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,470
everything so but for example here

309
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,460
you are least of old quick to
regulations

310
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,419
n I think that you should be

311
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:43,450
group you you although

312
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,730
regulations will all the text

313
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,429
all countries are nowadays conquering
Cooper from

314
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:54,690
so you will see all the texts

315
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,480
now open the oven but there is one mosel

316
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,480
regulation there was a regulation

317
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,010
so for impaired it was

318
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,970
general who into no make one that the
read to use only

319
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,720
national to cryptographic algorithm for
national

320
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,520
use I'm not sure that with that with
need to it will

321
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,480
use dispose possible in the next few
years

322
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,830
Anza vessel now agreement very interest
you

323
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,130
ET's the international agreement it is
muzah regulation

324
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,460
you have for you have years released

325
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,510
of the country's well

326
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,380
book well a playin to control of orkut
not only great too

327
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,049
but in fact with you often least

328
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:53,270
plus to Cincy more sensitive equipment
leased it is Tiffany

329
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,630
GGP is laser meanie meanie

330
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:03,630
ID the equipment and technology

332
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,370
Palm Beach to read your interest welcome
back with a

333
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,390
addition the French regulation threw to
first liberal country

334
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,230
of control in fact it is is a good
countries

335
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,960
verses the rest of the world

336
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,289
so glib so in France for example so I
would like to

337
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,510
i will like it too to show you

338
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,190
once again questions are more interest
in

339
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,190
than answers

340
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,250
so if you other loops to

341
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,460
these French application for the press
and I wouldn't

342
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,120
you have the same in also I mean saying
mom members

343
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,340
it say that in fact if you

344
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,460
won't to explore say sale

345
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,240
or me publish a good resume with

346
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,260
luxury we should cryptographic Creek of

347
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,529
largest size you often me authorized

348
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:09,360
all to at least to declare went easy

349
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,559
for large key size letters go to

350
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,870
category 1 annex appendix to

351
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:26,149
with once again it is in a position to
the US US diminish in lieu

352
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:29,409
sOooo by

353
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:33,360
year articles routine

354
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,360
large t he's in

355
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,230
more than 20 if I 56 beads

356
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,970
false image we could do and 500

357
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,260
12 it means that if you sale a yes

358
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:58,260
who 256 you are by a routine most of the
g20 countries low

359
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,520
unless there is some sort of -ism
control

360
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,600
things to ID community and it. the norse

361
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,220
in come back to the fact that the net
cryptographic algorithm just ne more

362
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,140
door

363
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,010
you been studied on the week wall of
Ulitsa

364
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,270
window open you on that do will be

365
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,610
nothing in fact he evolution

366
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:29,200
the technology it. willed we which make
it possible to control

367
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,200
so also going to quit a very a more
interesting than answers

368
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,010
you

369
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,390
so the party gonna petition any
equipment

370
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,429
since the GV the city Quitman as but
doors

371
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:52,470
in a way or another it's very single
from that need to contribute between

372
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,260
thank you they have no to comply

373
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,270
to the rule and in fact in the context
of

374
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:03,150
in terrible terrible you do you have to
use US equipment

375
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,260
and you have sry love the most famous

376
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,070
but that it is mandatory to be quick
when you're in the two country

377
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,260
we see school routines with McAfee
anti-virus and use Microsoft

378
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,370
operating system

379
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,700
social liberals coup of control is the
US if this is the rest of the world

380
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,520
and I will just quote the French member
of the members French government was

381
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,679
specialist of defense issues any sale
inflatable were for country

382
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,340
lying is that the two imposed on danse

383
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,590
everything me sees are to

384
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,370
blade I do certification and
standardization

385
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,790
bald

386
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,350
well for example your during the a
year's contest it was mandatory to some

387
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,750
meat

388
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,580
block safer technology it was not a
problem with the US needs have

389
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,510
it was a stone that quick look at the
stone doubts we should be considered

390
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,890
solo vaclav control very Jersey was
Academy

391
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,059
world economic we'll pretend to be
independent

392
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,950
invited which is a scientific backing a
smokescreen

393
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,750
on when you deal with the very complex

394
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,910
from to agrees I'm from the comp complex
from ago

395
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,540
communes were point of view it is
totally impossible to

396
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,620
score all the internal states to study
them

397
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,900
it is totally impossible and in fact the
lacked

398
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,280
is a lack of proof of insecurity becomes
defect to

399
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,809
approval security read all the
scientific paper

400
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,610
in fact with the call provable security
just that many BT to prove

401
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,610
insecurity in fact

402
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,200
well to rings a game the industry

403
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
and this nation-states that's where you
are

404
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,340
only a yes to fit 50 seats

405
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,740
in all equipment software so

406
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,860
the renters seen all about it is a
resist emission the

407
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,740
which is per year as a co 2 a curate

408
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,490
only 20 percent of cryptography research
is published

409
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,660
even you you or not we can publish any
anything we find

410
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,700
so you could say okay use to indeed the
killing me to communities independent

411
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,080
new

412
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,340
because in fact there are not both we
need to control it

413
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,770
push operation effect if you

414
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,580
analyze who wait paper acidity you have
to for some fiction

415
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,900
the peaks awesome to be just
systematically repeated

416
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,400
for example reinventions and some
organization

417
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,010
both discrete mathematics you conclude
by many

418
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,340
other loop to IT security papers

419
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,720
you find at the bottom any safe national
seance

420
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,570
from the Asian grant national security

421
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,679
a agency ground you can go on the any
say

422
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,790
website and you will find although fight

423
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:11,670
scientific project that the US view the
and is a out by Nancy

424
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,780
so the question he's are you really to

425
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,270
free to search in Palm Beach on some on
the

426
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,580
any tend to be too the answer is No

427
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm not sure that anyone would find
would-be

428
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,530
fiber putting them in time factory
agrees I'm

429
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,540
could do could do it so

430
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,370
if we come back to cryptography industry
after world we have two in fact

431
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,660
you have you know the date most the PRU
see

432
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,330
quick to machine and quick to equipment
in the world and of course

433
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,730
there are many people mean do 2003 come
to when we seem very surprisingly

434
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,900
I would like to to come back to the case
but good to eat is a case that they knew

435
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,040
have work on during many years

436
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,770
in fact a mmm dreams and is the last

437
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,179
fifty years quick to argue Swiss
companies whose

438
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,340
she's only does one use country of took
a late

439
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,000
in and grooves and cheese distances

440
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,210
it was a country of quick to machines
for government to use

441
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,080
it was the old ninety percent of

442
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,720
the the market Iran's 128

443
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,740
220 countries where using could to
machine from Kentucky

444
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,540
and in nineteen 582 19

445
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,380
95 the times we have gays things to say
your

446
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,600
Iranian government in fact a change

447
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,160
are the face the world regarding could
do with

448
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,820
you have your so it was a to present the
TVA of

449
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,810
mmm the crib to a GUI and he revealed
that they can fight during fifty years

450
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,990
all the group to machine sent to 120

451
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,060
to injuries we have trapped truck as

452
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,830
implementation ever all the mathematical
little and you should read

453
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,450
his book it was long before your
solution

454
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,820
the whistleblower for for the weather is
reinforced because he has been jailed in

455
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,480
here in the jail during nine months

456
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,840
and the this make you very talkative

457
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,970
but with I would like to show you

458
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,080
what is Mathematik fuel truck door just
an example which is of course

459
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,200
anonymized you in

460
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,160
re is year

461
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,880
it is mathematics

462
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,020
02 I tried dole's

463
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,100
be in plain plain light just because the
ago reason

464
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,590
but makes mathematics very difficult
YouTube you

465
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,970
to be possible to if we have time

466
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,250
to explain to you read the

467
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:08,250
re for these

468
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,340
it so

469
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,779
9 I 1992 with you

470
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:23,440
remember def soon be a mention you
probably should be surgically to

471
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,159
graffiti

472
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,159
attack very surprisingly remember all
the time only the DES

473
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,230
data and gives some doubt but we special
National Institute of Standards and

474
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,360
Technology with the

475
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,659
with a NSA the

476
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:42,710
in fact all the agrees unblock safer we
are inspired from the US

477
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,570
with Dave the differential cryptography
a crippling disease

478
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,799
all avatar yes I've been broken

479
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,110
Morris efficiently exit yes

480
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,340
we are still resistance from a practical
viewpoint view and of course we could

481
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,590
the NSA recognize they were a little bit
embarrassed

482
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,970
disable sorry we knew about

483
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,100
difference agreed to review twenty years
ago official burst

484
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,490
over the years was in nineteen in 1977

485
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,130
but 1992 mean is twenty

486
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,649
mates 5 at least five years grew

487
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:26,090
very interesting so the yes content

488
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,510
and you to this contest it was clear
that just turned out the mandatory

489
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,630
standouts West

490
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:34,549
and retrievers so

491
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:39,240
know from a pretty good point of view 02
I'd to

492
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,559
problems there are different levels
different we have to do

493
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,510
doing it of course you up it be strongly
depends

494
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,220
on the the context scientific context
the computing people were

495
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,399
environment and so on so you have to for
against

496
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,370
many many things for example remembered
that

497
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:03,039
the during the a year's contest the
algorithm is be

498
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,179
CQ for at least should your

499
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,029
unto you 100 your can redo

500
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:15,480
technical documentation and the
political condition the is complicity

501
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,639
written inside

502
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:21,039
what so you have to to do a lot of

503
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,419
interpolation in forecast first

504
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,450
of course between the first phase was
the easy

505
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,389
there was new academic community
everything was obscure

506
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:35,120
security by obscurity just by and trust
me

507
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,120
week with their easy and of course we
come back to the crib to educate these

508
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,020
who invited to back to a whale very

509
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,110
Raza week mathematical implementation
but dole's

510
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:55,799
and sometimes only implementation but

511
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,100
IQ's came into the play

512
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,470
and reverse engineering techniques for
software

513
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,380
and two wonderful media who and more
recently

514
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,970
even out where reverse remembers the
work of star Bergin

515
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,389
you just ignored who feeds it was very

516
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:20,980
was very out see a you can for Phillips
wins a a me faire

517
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,230
agrees and has been reversed missio

518
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,570
Union CSU you secure

519
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,779
to because I got very inventive
University so in fact

520
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:37,409
keeping the cryptographic see it using
secret is nonsense because now you can

521
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:38,020
find it

522
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,940
so you have to i'd to lower level at the
mathematical live

523
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,840
boom it can be

524
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,950
in protocols well GSM

525
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,710
SUV yes he for weapon so on even the CPP

526
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,100
there are many different ways 2i ideas
themes

527
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,520
Brimble risk aversion and so on you can

528
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,580
claim for developers mistake
incompetence to wake up dolls and

529
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,810
it is interesting because if you change
you batch differing abilities are

530
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,419
own always knew once community so you
will be

531
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:15,790
disappoint you you will have you

532
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,929
always moving averages to

533
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:24,179
what is interesting that do use a worker
vacuums

534
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,109
a more and more to able to

535
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,720
proposing to find most of these visa

536
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,369
or troubles so you have to goo looked to

537
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:40,490
even lower level mathematics so

538
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,250
out work in fact first remember all that
in operating

539
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,780
you putting system aspect is very
important if you want to retrieve the

540
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,250
key

541
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,639
will serve the time police is not for
accusing

542
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,929
undue in cryptic text he's looking east
in some fis

543
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,040
where you will find some information
about the keys

544
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,710
of calls the best solutions and was
difficult but the best solution

545
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,750
use mathematical trip dole's first

546
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,580
is very interesting You to consider but
the federal document

547
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,900
feats 140 has become some so

548
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,500
of standout you know to be very late
your

549
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,109
round on equity a few cryptographic
algorithm

550
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:27,630
standardization of mind that's way most
of the g8 countries

551
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:34,630
you there own secret statistical
aberration

552
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,080
yes just number if you want to

553
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,000
analyze a year's you have to concede
there

554
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,490
to 256 seitz

555
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,720
of to fusion

556
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,369
each set containing to 50 22 civil well
256

557
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,710
block you there in the universe occasion

558
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,750
and a sufficient number of computer in
order to store and

559
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,609
an array that so

560
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:10,290
you have years one of the possible run
map sorry to read a good

561
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,770
YouTube it mathematical working in my
lab on that

562
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,300
the in to room up to to

563
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,260
the general principle do i do
mathematical trouble you work in some

564
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,470
reference 8 you do pretty normal time
transmission

565
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,170
but going back to the original said is
difficult from the computer

566
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,240
computational point of view so we have a
lot of PhD says he's

567
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,780
for anyone interested and we are going
to

568
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,839
launch to project the

569
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,640
you do YouTube youtube.com you know the
trip the framework

570
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,020
you know to prove that it is possible to
I'd truck does it look like first

571
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,050
so as a conclusion of cool

572
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,589
you would have been possible to say many
things but

573
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:03,670
you can contact me you can do you mean
information

574
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:08,339
I think that re weekend would be in
France we have an expression we can that

575
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,849
be a business world

576
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:14,970
in his away we remain we must

577
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,599
not be naive loop

578
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,080
I TC you have computer ID

579
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,220
equipment everywhere in hospital in

580
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,140
traffic like management in everywhere

581
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,609
no all lives arm NH

582
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:37,119
and are depending from I teach and IT
services

583
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,300
AG equipment and of course formations
that is a very critical issue to go in

584
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,420
to to confer everything to it

585
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,780
should be national strategy issue

586
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,859
we asked if we couldn't read like Franz
should be

587
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:57,730
should remain independent or at least
Europe will I don't know

588
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:04,410
with we have to include some countries
of Europe's well more

589
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,420
US related but will teach those perrin

590
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,319
mmm keep your mind open there is no
scientific

591
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:15,490
orthodoxy everything is in Derry City
thats

592
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,849
big difference between the tackles will
which is very open

593
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,510
still no and Academy community which is
very

594
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,630
well some when aid and very blind

595
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:31,740
you we have to keep to all my mind very
open there is no by the eighties

596
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,780
only I do that working on it

597
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,839
and I'm sure I'm convenes that

598
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:42,190
I think large I care community

599
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,819
will be the critical national issues for
every country

600
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:51,180
would be Anna interest in that I think
that best example the germans

601
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,790
Germany from the very early oven in 1980

602
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,619
as organized the these the

603
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:05,349
it's like Acura community in a very
intersting wing

604
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:09,190
an well

605
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,520
I think that the future should not be in
CDs in multinational

606
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,420
ends it's a safety issue it was between
your pains in my pens

607
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,119
in every citizen's we cannot sub
contract for security

608
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,880
to multinationals and very recently was
a priest

609
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,819
project they are the queen to a priest
new project

610
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:34,240
I strongly advise you to group you have
the choice

611
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,720
you are free not to youth baseball not
to use a bull

612
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,000
not to use Microsoft be aware

613
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,280
that they re they are alternatives

614
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,980
but the security is you

615
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,150
issue is your problem it is a citizen
issues

616
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,450
to you have to decide

617
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,240
and to be very active don't let those
are people too thin for you

618
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,170
into day decision for you

619
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:11,170
quitting time here

620
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,859
so if you want to have more documents in
technical information

621
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:28,859
compact to question

622
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,430
those laid with you the ball will see
reason the organizer

623
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,220
how to make them public
