1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,080
we'll other Google Chrome extensions and
the purpose of the stock is simply too

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,020
I show your are why Google Chrome
extensions are

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,090
an easy target so why you are they love

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,420
the targets a really are attractive to
look at

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,609
and say you also will be given tips and
so

6
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:25,819
tools that will help you win doing a

7
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:29,179
research on Google Chrome extensions on
your own a

8
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,399
my name is Christopher povich I but this
for these

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,559
beautiful company saw my resources such
some kind soul

10
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,039
side were vulnerability say also blocked
wheat and blah blah blah blah blah

11
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,289
but this is not the talk about me but
about Google Chrome extension so

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,100
a wats our Google Chrome extensions

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,469
first 3 I these are notes

14
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,480
Google or just on the browser plug-ins
so

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,760
the Google Chrome extensions is not set
Java

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,530
plugin it's not super light is not set
PDF reader

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,450
a job grupo Chrome extensions and bro
struggles in general they are

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,210
basically html5 applications that's

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,150
a and reach your gross are user
experience and they allow

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,870
a by installing a extension you give
feel brosser additional

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,730
functionality sorrel the website get and
reach in certain way

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,470
about us multiple extensions for doing
some on my bookmarking for doing some

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,010
are I page recommendations somewhat
noble take years thanks to some web

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,820
developer orient its extensions et
cetera et cetera

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,850
I'll and

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,400
that most important a slight i think is
this in the stock why are they

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,950
are why are they interesting as a
subject to research and why are they

28
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,610
are white anyone what's the wants to
look at the security of Google Chrome

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,510
extensions

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,740
when the cell lot of web sites but are
already vulnerable in now

31
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,200
multiple way some votes you know a
vulnerabilities

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,390
being discovered like almost daily verse
a lot of

33
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,370
and dusters doing this stuff every day
well I'll

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,870
Google com extensions are basically a
sumo

35
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,880
obligations so they suffer from the same

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,600
vulnerabilities as the usual web sites
Botsa

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,070
at the same time very they have are

38
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,080
higher privileges fund the usual from
web sites

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,830
very for example us is of course are
defined

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,970
it would be defines for their on-the-job
to talk about

41
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,319
II in theory then they have a can read
and write all the cookies including

42
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,880
dates to be on the caucus

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,069
solo voy a IR Marie good subjects a

44
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,380
to a start to session hijacking a doc

45
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,830
how they can even change a proxy
settings they didn't block requests that

46
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,020
say you're we are also is trying to send

47
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,280
over HTTP or HTTPS make them take
screenshots on the web sites

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,230
personal are versus like basically most
of the extensions when they are being

49
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,040
exploited

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,950
a form like to universal same origin
policy bypass

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,440
for all the website but see the users
visiting so

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,050
this makes them really interesting and
how are they built

53
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,290
while a bunch of ice but it's not as you
know is that file

54
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,150
it's also being signed with a developer
key so just like to use while

55
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,690
mobile applications on on different
platforms it's a similar

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,670
a similar infrastructure here I'll
despite his success and CRX but that

57
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,459
doesn't really matter how do you install
another web extension

58
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,360
I'll basically now you come

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,750
more or less only install them through
Chrome Web Store

60
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,099
are sold these are curated by Google I
of course there are some

61
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,480
ways to install them from the third
party website or from

62
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,550
just when you least like the CRX fight
but the zza these ways of the stunning

63
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,860
extensions I'm mates it deliberately

64
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,910
more and more difficult for common use a
so-called

65
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,840
as ice as a power user let's say you
have a way to do it but it's not say

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,760
reusing like in the are let's see social
engineering scenario

67
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,860
arm extensions

68
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,470
are ok up for a few a distinctive
components

69
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,259
first you have a manifest file similar
liking most of their

70
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,840
mobile applications the money first file

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,270
lists all them components in bed at cell

72
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,629
differences the application permissions
and stuff and stuff

73
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:34,059
I and out to other components for its we
will

74
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:38,719
the take a deeper look during this whole
doc content script and you pates

75
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:42,289
so what about manifest file well it's
just a simple

76
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:47,029
Jason file I'll with the name on an
extension description and stuff

77
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:51,349
I accuse the permissions the a that
we're gonna be over

78
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,650
but I am just to describe later butts
are

79
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,360
one of the most important sections is
the conference code section

80
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,849
of an extension and cue the you as you
can see about two inches

81
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,029
versus matches and it simply that's a
regular expression or I'll

82
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,270
are a former expression which defines

83
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,479
a on which web sites are is the
extension or

84
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,520
the conference group listed here up

85
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,150
on which website are they gonna gonna
rock

86
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,150
so as long as the you are much is too
thats

87
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:31,339
17 extension are alongside the usual
webpage Thomond usual web page

88
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,419
JavaScript calls

89
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,610
a your brow so loads up this conference
tripped

90
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,770
in in the case of this example do there
would be a key to content script addict

91
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,110
daiquiri library and that

92
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,349
and a second script I and sell

93
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,969
this one one component type of Google
Chrome extensions

94
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:52,909
the second one it's related to the user
interface of

95
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,930
over over an extension a expression
scans have

96
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,979
like some little bottom buttons in on
the interface

97
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,199
are they also have like an option space
and stuff

98
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,879
hands GHD Axwell document but Lowe's

99
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,050
all loads up he liking you know in a
sort of a popup or something like that

100
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,869
the sake of course constructed by HTML
and this HTML this document what is

101
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,080
being loaded

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,430
is called a few page to make thing so

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,839
more complicated to pose a special for
the was a special

104
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,900
kinda view page a which doesn't review
because it's doesn't

105
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,319
arm it's invisible its collar back on
page

106
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,580
and background pages released so
interesting because

107
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,619
its debates it's the document but leaves
a

108
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:40,039
throughout the whole Mar browser session
so it's

109
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,240
its runs constantly in the background so
you as long as you can execute golden

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,449
that the main

111
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,369
its persistent

112
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:53,199
some extensions also bundle and Tati
plugins

113
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,509
these are simply binary code compliant
for the IT architecture that's

114
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,399
the brosser Ron set are mean sold

115
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:04,899
subjected to assess the hell out of
myself for a so fights

116
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,399
but not a lot of extension see your sexy
and gave my plugins

117
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,389
for a good reason and what about the
security of the extension so how do all

118
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:13,490
those components

119
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,020
arm talk to each other that's a

120
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,800
what now the first part comp that script

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,740
I while the content script arounds in a
context or in origin of

122
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,080
over the web page that is being
displayed in a certain bells atop

123
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,610
so of course it can access the the
actual Dom

124
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,789
elements don't 3 is coming modified a
DOM

125
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,099
to enrich our web sites to let's say I
dunno wat caption all the images for

126
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:41,990
example

127
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,830
I'll marine so some some additional
toolbar said such

128
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,419
up it does so using the standard
JavaScript a

129
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:55,580
JavaScript are I dough mixer accessories
like you know it's Tim out property or

130
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,849
document talkie document title whatever

131
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,419
I am soul there's a way of

132
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:05,189
mmm exchanging information between the
website

133
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:08,270
and the part of an extension cord
conference crypt

134
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,759
but at the same time conference clips
cannot

135
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,649
talk directly to the javascript running
running for the

136
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:19,899
you within the web page so it cannot
call

137
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,270
functions the scouts are it cannot be
called

138
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,509
a moved from the original website

139
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,479
iPhone there is a security boundary here
I'll

140
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,919
conference group also get access to the
powerful

141
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,060
from exit are objects the which is used
to

142
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,159
submit that's a AJAX requests

143
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,560
but this one is much more powerful
because it's cause the main so

144
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,759
woo website of origin a dot com

145
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,680
I which has a account that's good
running here can also

146
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,959
arm query the be dots

147
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,160
arm Sr domain documents as a reader
responses back

148
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,550
from for this much about conference
group

149
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,690
up when it comes to view pages I'll

150
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,029
they can communicate with content script
and the other way around only by sending

151
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,410
messages and receiving responses similar
to

152
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,620
let's say %eh 0542 message API

153
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,980
so verse also no date direct dome access
from here to here

154
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,560
I've personal direct function calls and
such it's just exchange

155

instantiate new content scripts

157
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,959

you can direct the bus the coldest wind

158
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,980
farms are here in

159
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,529
it will get evaluated as a conference
group in a context of the

160
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,180
web page for you but is being viewed arm

161
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,850
your pages in but don't Bates a RG only
compliments of over Google Chrome

162
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,800
extensions which get access

163
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,920
through this powerful Chrome extension
API this is the

164
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,019
the hot stuff an extension I mean

165
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,220
up with a using this API d

166
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,449
extension can actually change a proxy
settings you know

167
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:11,170
money for your requests access York his
three access your cookies

168
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,889
access open stops take screenshots of
your website's

169
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,370
access the data for two based in a
clipboard and such

170
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,569
I also on your page is about pages

171
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:27,620
by default can call JJ plugins

172
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,180
of course s assists a similar to

173
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,319
to what mobile applications almost %uh
firms do a

174
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,410
extensions have permission so versa
close

175
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,560
list of permissions for the money first

176
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,779
lists as being required for the
extension to work and a police station

177
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,889
the user has to agree im on those
permissions

178
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:52,420
arm so about to sum it up

179
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,750
versa kind of separation of powers when
it comes to mind

180
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,420
come to the construction for the
architecture's Google Chrome extensions

181
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,819
on the left side you have content script
are which have

182
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,259
only the access to the to the dome and
to the

183
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,509
exit route object I'm on the right you
have much more powerful components which

184
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,970
get access to all this

185
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,399
interestingly guys including Dubai
northolt went

186
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,959
in the form of NGK plugs and between
them of course

187
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,910
verse on the exchange of messages are
this right side is limited by

188
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,449
permissions

189
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:29,629
and this left side distributed by who
you are white it's because

190
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,970
the excess doesn't run on pretty much NE
Patriots

191
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,980
it's also the fight the manifest

192
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,000
are soul extensions are HTML

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,930
applications and thus a lot of them are
so no wonder

194
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:50,259
that's the most prevalence be HTML web
sites related former abilities

195
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,389
I've have taken place I've of course

196
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,529
i'm talking about. XSS I view

197
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,790
page da mix assess what's really really
bad thing here

198
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,050
like a year ago I'll

199
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,250
because there were many many extensions
which were vulnerable to da michael says

200
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,910
because

201
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,610
basically know when you're designing web
applications no matter if they're

202
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,399
home extensions or web-sites it's easier
to write a vulnerable called

203
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,060
them it is to write the safe one so up

204
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,709
how does a typical the mean XSS take
place

205
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,100
well a in this up talk cool will

206
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,290
I will focus on on Vic Toews a

207
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,509
employing a malicious website so the
model Lisa

208
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:38,870
user has some certain vulnerable
extension installed and he visits a

209
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,980
malicious website

210
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,290
which tries to explode extension so
basically

211
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,120
we have payloads in the website well
what page Dom

212
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,019
let's say it's in the title and some
let's say it's a bookmarking extension

213
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:51,519
so

214
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,079
with acting up on extension on some way

215
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,509
with feets user interface or by I don't
know approaching

216
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:03,670
a clicking on a button but the extension
has provide it in the website

217
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,860
I'll bookmarking happens so of course

218
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,149
the content script fatuous the payload
from the dome

219
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:15,480
into it some variable

220
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,730
I stuff happens a and than

221
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,829
the extension for what's its to the view
page

222
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:25,800
by you sending message with the with the
title of of

223
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,209
of debates that's user wants to bookmark
and then that you page

224
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,279
does its logic and decides to displayed
a

225
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,850
title of the website a back within its
you what

226
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,110
that's a nice pop and we have classic

227
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,129
Dom XSS vulnerability box

228
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,980
it's not a damn exercising you know say
in just the website it's Anna

229
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,360
accessing view pics over an extension so

230
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,490
are we get access to to that

231
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,079
all the API sped the extension was
permitted

232
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,110
to access and we can also really simply

233
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,569
running about drugs because that
previous page

234
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:07,910
a is actually just dissipates
momentarily when the user presses the

235
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,779
the pop up but some I and then he
disappears and and gets destroyed so are

236
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,189
we can nevertheless very picky quickly
migrate our call to the back on page but

237
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:19,009
simply

238
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:23,350
and Colin Chrome extension that become
page this is the reference to the window

239
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,029
and does accessing the evil function and
I'm calling it

240
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,860
some so

241
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,920
example of an extensive of an extension
which is

242
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,060
which is vulnerable to this for example
slick RSS feed finder

243
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,560
1.3 are it's an extension which

244
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,779
helps your arm substrates to RSS feed so
it's

245
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,749
it looks for certain elements a.m. in a
page and the space about some

246
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:54,149
papers the feed available would you like
to subscribe to depict about some

247
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,249
you subscribe to extension of course are

248
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:00,779
in a most are the way you for saddam XSS
vulnerability he

249
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,759
because it displays the calm the title
back so are

250
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,949
the usual bailouts ants

251
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,749
I think the demos yup the demos help
them right now

252
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:16,019
so let me just here I have

253
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,589
just the usual a exploit here

254
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,160
other out document that location right
are

255
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,420
sold by just so going up

256
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,579
will success or the slick assess right
so

257
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,730
as you can see probably see yeah this is
the icon of an extension

258
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,499
I just click it Iran's this is my
location this is not so

259
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:44,059
my usual website def dot local host its
my comics tension origin so wat

260
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,939
this is kind of a proof that I have a
lot different privileges right now

261
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:53,639
I'll another kind of a liability which
is

262
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,180
far more of I would say scary but Sir

263
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,300
fortunately it's not that common it's
when you have

264
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,800
anti-gay plugging on above Buy Now
called vulnerabilities in sight

265
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,160
I'll usually looks like this are

266
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,120
but also I at malicious payload army
gets transferred to the comp unscripted

267
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,939
gets transferred to the view page

268
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,660
and a few bites accesses arm

269
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,829
and methods that is exported by D&J
plugin

270
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:23,300
and in the perimeter we have a we have
the payload and

271
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,329
I N PA que plugins are simply binary
code so

272
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,689
as long as they have some binary
vulnerabilities like

273
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,769
come on the exact same for example or a
buffer overflow or whatever

274
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:36,279
%ah we can start from the web page

275
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,540
and the interesting thing is that

276
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,720
my cold running to 90-88 talking drums

277
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,509
outside any chrome some books so it's
just

278
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:49,649
there's no need to escape from some
books which gets you know much said

279
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:52,819
my more and more expensive let's say

280
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,709
throughout the years anti-trust with
just your user permissions that you

281
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,449
serve at once the process so

282
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,879
as long as it's totes a bus let's say
your show

283
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,120
a my on the machine I'll

284
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,300
I was able to find find an extension a
I'm

285
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,430
vulnerable to to disarm to this
vulnerability

286
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,820
and I was able to successfully exploited
let me I talk about CR GPG extension

287
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,650
of course this once already passed a
like

288
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,820
when I published a book or see so few
months ago a

289
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,530
it's an extension which tries to marry
to cover the Gmail interface

290
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,870
and GBG binary which seems

291
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,750
really arm what could possibly go wrong
thing to do

292
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,080
and that's exactly what what happens a
it and riches

293
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,100
the Gmail interface with certain bottoms

294
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,050
or links to the cook message verify
messages

295
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,200
and swear these of course take some
those it for what's

296
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,070
I'll the actual let's say cryptogram or

297
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,100
or the plane thanks to the actual deputy
binary

298
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,780
I'm reads the response back to to
replace it

299
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,010
so there were two extent it over with
the sitter which

300
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,860
combined made a really nice exploit the
first one was

301
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,910
but actually do so this extension
exercise gmail

302
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,410
dot com which is really fun things to do
are

303
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,970
by the way if you have for conference
security policy mum

304
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,380
within your web sites I can still access
it via Google Chrome extension

305
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,460
which is need a so up

306
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,950
usual thing a you have I as an attack or
something and cryptic message to encrypt

307
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,940
it with your public key you have an
extension you start you want your

308
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,960
press the button to the crypt lived a
message and within that message

309
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,460
were sentenced him out with JavaScript
and guess what

310
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,930
it's being directly insert that's via
email which demand is of course that

311
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,150
would require upper

312
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,590
a a it gets inserted back in the Gmail

313
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,850
interface so you Google had some that
Google as a

314
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,210
as a company is a move let's say Wed May
fielder

315
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,370
have the no possibility to are actually

316
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,840
feeder routes the malicious h2 edged him
out because it

317
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,860
only got like access to the bankrupted
contact

318
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,200
a so this was the first vulnerability so
I could get

319
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,830
XSS ok of your inbox when I said to a
group that message on your the cryptid

320
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,900
but the second one was actually the
common injection in the MPK plugin

321
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,260
this is up the function that was
vulnerable was the function used to

322
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,470
encrypt message

323
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,620
and it's when you encrypt messages with
PGP you usually need someone to encrypt

324
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,160
it still

325
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,270
because units they public keys so for

326
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,770
the list the list of up recipients came
from the Gmail

327
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,460
I'll and as you could probably see for
something fishy going on because there's

328
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,200
a lot of

329
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,550
common strengths appended to each other
and then later on executed but

330
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,740
this one is actually a email addresses

331
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,870
of of the recipients of course no they
were infused arts

332
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,880
very were invalidated of course versa

333
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,050
like classic commanders you execution
vulnerability

334
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,570
so I sent to a cryptic email you the
trip that it's an idea

335
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,950
have about mentor Peter so long you're
on your box so

336
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,330
that both thats vets the are proof of
how

337
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,310
well how was a developer can keep
themselves in the fourth when music and

338
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,620
KK plugins

339
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,360
incorrectly are there are tools for
exploiting chrome Google com extensions

340
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,220
one of them is folk sample the beef
module be fierce

341
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,390
already before sold already mentioned
it's you

342
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,290
it's a very neat to to exploit XSS
basically

343
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,750
arm and one of the modules is a fake
last update module

344
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,440
the idea he surveyed created an
extension gave it all

345
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,680
possible permissions a insight %um
inject it's a

346
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,710
the extension basically injects the beef
ok so basically

347
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,300
excesses every website but the user
visits on every tab

348
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,430
and they package it as a Adobe fake last
update module

349
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,610
and of course you need some social
engineering firm is the use it up to 20

350
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,150
install the Flash plugin up and

351
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,710
actually a it was easier back then it
was his

352
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,700
is your like say a few months ago
because it was very easy to install

353
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,160
extensions from from a

354
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,040
CRX I just need it so too drag and drop
it but that will change things

355
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,420
I so what they actually tried uploading
this

356
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,560
particular extension into Google Chrome
Web Store and guess what it got accepted

357
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,910
without a problem and

358
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,040
you could download The Exorcist threat
from global webster

359
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,140
yet a so this is the part of the beef
are

360
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,600
I took a different approach I developed
frame or co Texas itself

361
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,000
mates are specifically for exploiting

362
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,580
a.m. excesses in a min Google Chrome
extensions

363
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,960
up basically it works similarly to to
beef

364
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,100
are versa really short payload virgin

365
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,740
a but you need to inject and executing
our extension

366
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,760
over just before the rubble and once you
executive thats

367
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,250
be some javascript I get the connection
via websites

368
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,260
a protocol to my server listening for

369
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,350
Commons to control and I can call month
a

370
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,060
I can command a petition to do need
stuff VR just using

371
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,190
web application on that occurs box so I
can

372
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,630
browse all your arm but also tops

373
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,720
I by the way also the the one in the
Private Browsing

374
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,980
moats good so it's not three private
anymore

375
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,610
a I am so yeah

376
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,030
so I could do that I could say execute
JavaScript on pretty much

377
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,060
any domain I goods are grab Google
contacts the

378
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,450
just sending send Inc request to this

379
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,710
particularly at this particular URL

380
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,710
based on the fact that the actual
requests are being makes

381
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,350
by the victims were also we follow
appropriate cookies and stuff

382
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,420
are verso so many many

383
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,690
payloads I'm prepared to a woman to
stall like

384
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,520
for example set proxy setting so as long
as extension has the necessary

385
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,670
permissions

386
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,120
you could see the set up a HTTP proxy
within the browser

387
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,580
and this is really interesting because
there was no way for the user to

388
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,490
actually change them back because

389
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,300
a a once you get to the proxy setting
Senor

390
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,320
chrome crime simply says sorry you
cannot change prop settings because

391
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,690
those are managed by the extension

392
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,460
and he doesn't even say which extension
does manage it

393
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,560
so well yeah you could do that you could
sell for example of persistence group

394
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,880
which kept on running on every top for

395
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,730
forever a this particular payloads just

396
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,180
looks for the forms where the type of
within product type:

397
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,500
passport and for what it back so I got
on your credentials from

398
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,990
any website are

399
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,680
so this was the thing a

400
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,770
let's say a year ago I have it was
really happy exploiting

401
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,920
a superior because you put more or less
download stop

402
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,880
about 10,000 extensions run some gripe

403
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,550
spence maybe one day and you get them
extensions

404
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,560
were vulnerable UT's you just looked at
which one is the most popular are

405
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,890
prepared to pay look for that some
starts

406
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,250
you know ok you're poking around a but
thats

407
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,290
is usually the think when exercises so
popular

408
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,480
arm soul %uh Google introduced so

409
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,470
around a year ago be introduced the
something called money for the vision to

410
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,910
and of course money first person to you
know extensions

411
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,180
most of the time seem to be a written so
you it's not just changed when the file

412
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,640
is

413
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,110
basically changed the whole extension
most of the times

414
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,740
and mmm the most important thing in
money first version two extensions

415
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,670
is the content security policy are this
is that

416
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,400
more or less default I i formated some
some declarations from content security

417
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,140
policy

418
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,030
but this is the default one and forced
to by dr.

419
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,360
a by DU in force by Google and so the

420
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,830
fair it's not really we are not really
able to relax its even

421
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,450
now so basically what it says is no in
lights cooking do so

422
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,880
allow team Google Chrome extensions gold
and not the values functioning

423
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,970
by default up basically that means know
the mix assess

424
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,170
sorry so I'll let's not 3dr

425
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,210
that something for a security researcher
and not fun fiend

426
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,810
for my work out us I guess I'll

427
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,610
Bob wove thats about that but the world
and swats the time I'm currently

428
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,700
a in September a Google Chrome Web Store
will delete all

429
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,730
view on extensions I in January

430
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,190
chrome stops loading you an extension so
all

431
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,000
the tools but we have developed over grr

432
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,020
the last year was stimulus

433
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,360
stop making sense because there's no
cold so vulnerable to that

434
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,750
a currency almost called for the
expenses are RV one so

435
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,650
a lot of excesses we probably diet die
out

436
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,380
own yet but

437
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,110
most is very still a way of attacking v2
extensions

438
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,790
a away thats are

439
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,550
will probably bill still left by the
Google by by Google because

440
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,170
are verse kind of by design thing

441
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,740
and I'm talking about icon
transcriptomics assess

442
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,400
how does it look like usual well you
have the webpage Tom

443
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,940
with some secret bailouts crafted for an
extension

444
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,570
how it gets fetched by the content
straight

445
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,950
who I'm actually convinced it would
simply evil that are inserted back into

446
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,370
the

447
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,910
the DOM and that would be dose this all
starts to go to the whole

448
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,140
execution of but most of the times what
happens is

449
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,660
the content script forward to to the to
the few bites

450
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,010
up you but does that stuff and then

451
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,620
Kohls annual conference quit chrome tops
execute script the

452
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,460
this is the function to the Scentsy 80
new content script answer of course

453
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,450
dust some security by by appending
strings without validation world any

454
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,530
if any form of of featuring

455
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,920
are yeah and we have the Nexus S and the
question is a

456
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,770
what do we achieve the ID sex assess

457
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,080
well we can as we are still in our
extension contexts

458
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,290
we r the conference could call we can
send request back to the extension back

459
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,340
in but this this

460
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,320
are rarely exploitable I what we can do
though

461
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,580
this weekend issue the cross-domain XO
exits are so if I exploits

462
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,660
an extension from my malicious page dot

463
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,010
are ch I can issue

464
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,910
exit I requests from all the other
domains with all your other cookies

465
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,110
a unfortunately versa whitelist

466
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,030
for the URS a that's the can be queried
tell can be a fetch

467
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,680
3 multi a but you know what happens when
when you offer a white least two

468
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,410
about to implement those well

469
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,040
this happens mostly so almost half of
the extensions

470
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,650
by dr. my rough query just uses the wise
cart

471
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,590
so exploding car for them will simply
arm

472
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,640
allow you to query almost any website on
the internet and then get the responses

473
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,380
back

474
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,880
so basically do that universal session
hijacking gets a

475
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,720
arm example of an extension which is
vulnerable

476
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,180
of course this is current version so our

477
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,440
it's an extension cord is healing
preview and swatted das is

478
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
saw its office link reviews

479
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,860
so basically it ops a ton of stuff to

480
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,000
to the original web page Dom a who
working on mouseover

481
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,070
events and stuff and basically you can
write right click anything

482
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,310
parents preview dealings in a in a
certain pop up or something

483
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,500
a but you can as well for example

484
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,940
mmm safe a link to Google Bookmarks so
not the actual page but you're right but

485
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,900
the link but this

486
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,970
a but is being displayed over to are

487
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,200
what it does a is its fetches

488
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,770
with Ajax it fetches the target off of
the 8 Ref

489
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,850
a it looks for the title with the silly
regular expression

490
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,240
I'll ex trucks it's here and so use at
the crime types execute scripts

491
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,880
with just sad really are scary

492
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,040
i've seen to combat the nation here
without any escaping

493
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,830
whatsoever I so class economic system
cried

494
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,080
arm so let me show you a dermal

495
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,290
arm

496
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,360
if you can see all those easy about
those are actually

497
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,370
this particular nasty excess walking

498
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,890
are so easy preview dots all

499
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:05,890
got zero is an extension which looks
like this

500
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,800
right just up a lot in the title on

501
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,750
no fun here so I just right keep this
little fellow

502
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,530
up use the Save Link to to google
bookmarks and I get the

503
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,100
as you can see my you are those
currently the webpage so I'm

504
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,170
in the context of other web page but

505
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,410
but for small lets you can you can
actually do

506
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,680
ants what I did is a created

507
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,700
to to actually abused abuses on our
ability

508
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,220
I it's called mosquito it's got mostly
too because its complaints Maria

509
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,740
a mother ER use the projects from

510
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,020
I think two years ago or something by
island of the doubt

511
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,320
very a very smart fellow

512
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,960
he was trying to in

513
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,630
to develop a proof of concept that's are
insecure

514
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,520
are cross domain XML files so I think
that's what flushes

515
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,430
a if thats why its cards close to my
neck some of i sorry a bad idea for for

516
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,320
a website to

517
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,330
are to have so he developed a tool

518
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,870
but I just youth to michael kors here

519
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,940
up if I could describe the truth
products

520
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,290
shop southeast just you can use access
in extension

521
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,690
to make the HTTP proxy so are

522
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,770
the fingers versa call you know

523
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,960
whole chain of of things but basically

524
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,020
you have a Nexus S in the concert
scripts which a

525
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,300
your abuse to evaluate a certain bailout

526
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,440
and then a on your up to Christmas you
have a steep decline like that's a buyer

527
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,270
for your

528
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,390
just your browser basically unusual HTTP
requests

529
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,440
and those requests from a two-day
extension and they

530
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,280
make the 80th request the brawl so happy
I thought this cookies and this is the

531
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,400
most important part part after all

532
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,920
ans than I get the response text back

533
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,820
which is what you usually don't have for
cross-domain requests

534
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,240
a and the responses of course travels
back to I

535
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,770
to my tool in 2008 she declined so let's
look at the APR

536
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,800
actual put it working are

537
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,920
but so much 5 called from the bot

538
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,860
if you talk it's launch up

539
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,170
i'm waiting for a briefing for start-up
yeah

540
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:35,110
everything seems to be working so

541
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,310
yep solar versa needs a most door

542
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,140
who generator it's just the sort sir on
JavaScript

543
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,810
I'm to be encoded it's basically notes
the main payload so

544
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:52,570
antivirus it after all a defaults are
okay for me so I will just

545
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,260
copy copie de facto to the keyboards

546
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,210
and I will use are Houston he's in
Pretoria

547
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,920
so as you can see I'm abusing the fact
that the extension

548
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,450
up in strings to I'm evaluated on a
scapegoat

549
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,530
everything is okay I guess plus evil

550
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:18,110
yeah was some under you you

551
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,600
yeah I think I'm done here so

552
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,610
I'll observe the arm

553
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,200
this are you so basically this is my

554
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,650
my arm or malicious web sites right

555
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,890
I saved the link to Google Bookmarks

556
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,260
ants yeah it's connected to Maria
servers so

557
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,500
I can use my by proxy observed Isis

558
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,550
this is my local hot spots see this is
the actual

559
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,810
window to my extension and as you can
see

560
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,040
I can issue queries to across the main

561
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,520
this is a different domain name and your

562
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,450
this was text s actually making dazed
ajax request

563
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,110
hands as you can see probably the with
those very small so

564
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,139
I will needs to the windows for small
though

565
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,250
your words probably will be easy to see

566
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,190
I'm trying to to find a HDB user-agent:

567
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,290
worries it worries it somewhere at the
bottom

568
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,870
think

569
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,870
I

570
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,360
I just look at its you

571
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,030
yeah as you can see I'm crumb 27 so this
is the boss over though

572
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,610
hijacked a swell item the of course

573
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:48,050
up fightstick cock in Paris website but
what's really important I can also

574
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,940
well this is a little bit streak I I
have no time to to explain why

575
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,380
HDB s-works like this hereabouts

576
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,330
basically Aiken fetch their gmail
account

577
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,060
and these are that he may so for my
victim

578
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:10,060
so the extension allows you to simply
are

579
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,990
roast that browse the web to roaster
wept s your arm

580
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,990
as your victim would be so

581
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,100
basically lets it I mean or

582
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,660
what I would like to to to remember from
the stock

583
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,810
is that the extensions RFC mail
applications we suffer from the same

584
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,240
would follow beatty's

585
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,500
i've only described XSS but firsts a

586
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,650
if you were interesting as well I'll

587
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,120
they are also very easy to explode
because basically

588
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,180
an no one looked at them hard enough

589
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,450
so vests just I guess a bunch of guys

590
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,990
doing that's as a hobby or something I

591
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,650
it's still possible to exploit my first
be two extensions the contrary to

592
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,690
popular belief

593
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,790
a even though they have content security
policy

594
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,470
are hence when you expect an expression
you graph

595
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:11,460
you be you get so much more
possibilities oh that's those

596
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,110
actually no point exploiting simple web
sites when a

597
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,280
when you get so much power from from
expecting something does which is

598
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,370
commonly installed

599
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,390
home and of course there are tools that
can help you were for expecting

600
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,160
extensions

601
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,520
ants that's it do you have any questions

602
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,520
yes

603
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,670
were

604
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,570
was probably a PA for it are you seventh
really paid attention to the latest AK

605
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,550
additions but

606
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,410
the thing is that every two months or
something for some new API in

607
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,960
chrome excesses that allows you for a
both

608
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,570
for example a year ago extension already
caught the the

609
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,830
use the text to speech in seoul there
was even a bailout which

610
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:05,830
simply said to all your dorms yes

611
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,660
in

612
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,420
we could look at look it up in a

613
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,820
just go with a good documentation for
the next session of extensions about

614
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,270
a the thing is a you're usually limited
to what permissions does the extension

615
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,690
have

616
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,500
I so a either you package your own
militias extensions

617
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,980
a which is a vector about arc but that's
not that's the

618
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,370
come on lately Batsu

619
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,420
what you what you will have the
extensively to

620
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,760
are you would need to win abilities
actually

621
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,120
one in the in securely accepting
something from the content script and

622
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,360
launching the use a media API

623
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,430
from thats and txs ASEAN conference
crypt

624
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:01,430
yes

625
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:07,630
I

626
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,840
well not so much I mean you cannot

627
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,869
in a bit enable in a scripting I

628
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,430
but you can get the evil back a

629
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,609
you can say unsafe evil a use that as a
civil construct

630
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:25,950
but you have to do it manually and that
a in fact a lot of expression do

631
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,660
because they use the template libraries
and butts I even so the discussion the

632
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,720
one the when they were discussing
whether it's a good thing so low and so

633
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,470
if you follow is

634
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,200
it's a bad thing for it be needed to
that is because a lot of expenses used

635
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,220
used evolve for templating up

636
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,359
also you can relax in

637
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:50,480
relax the CSP in the way of specifying
the sources of

638
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,950
of the images other another I type so
for

639
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,480
contents but you cannot load stuff from
HDPE

640
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,520
especially the scripts cannot be low
that's the from

641
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,230
HTTP protocol on the on the HDDs arm

642
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,720
other than that you have a sandboxed are
so

643
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,800
there's a way to actually up executes
unsafe coat

644
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,480
on trust it's cold in a sandbox so well
with the simple to also have the

645
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,099
like to post message: mechanism to query

646
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:27,099
yes

647
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:37,479
a

648
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:41,539
I would imagine because love extensions
are actually arm

649
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:46,319
arcs the let's say just the part of the
medical system oversights and

650
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:50,079
companies like where you have a
first-party bookmarking service

651
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,529
whatever you have de gaulle you have a
lot of Evernote

652
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:57,089
you have a lot of a those kind of
applications with have

653
00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:01,249
they own mobile clients whatever and
access is just a part of the cycle

654
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:01,819
system

655
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:05,309
and they directly usually querida mom

656
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:08,859
the API from are cross-domain

657
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,920
from the conference could not from a few
page

658
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,839
and I would say that's the reason yeah

659
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,239
its it's rather people use its are yeah

660
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:28,359
lets people have have their thing

661
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:35,359
okay thanks so much value here
