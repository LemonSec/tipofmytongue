1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,860
hi everyone thank you for coming months
more talks afternoon

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,629
I as you can kinda see from the first
lloyd's

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,969
tough for Mossimo talk is probably a
little bit different talk to you

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,679
seen before reason for that is espers
what I'm doing is I'm telling the story

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,260
of what

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,270
the work I've been doing for the past
six or seven years so I wanted to look a

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,210
little bit different

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,980
so we've actually done is we we we've
done stalking performers have a comic

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,400
book

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,310
hold talks the whole talkers in this
condo for my not actually have

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,610
is small printed versions of the talk as
well

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,750
so if one wants a copy of that if you
put your hand up now

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,950
I'm you given a copy I'm

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,430
analog get on with this talk soul

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,450
arm 1 I'm gonna be talking about

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,710
is as you seen in the schedule what are
called the real experiments application

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,870
security story

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,149
I mean really is the story of I how

19
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,469
the company I work for me in my job
relax went from

20
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,489
no application security in the business

21
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,650
to where we are today you you get to he
where we are today in your

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,140
and have this talk worries my deepest
talk was

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,119
towards the back and all last year I saw
or

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,780
to really good application security
talks someone from the security guy he

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,070
said

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,330
X Inc and one from the security goes it
with them and they showed

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,829
arm a really good level of automation so
they showed that they were

28
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,950
really brilliant automation application
security

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,500
and so on my immediate thought when I
saw that was

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,570
thats that's brilliant port

31
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,729
how does the company get from North im
to wear those companies all right now

32
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,210
okay I said that's workable people and
their response was well

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,560
if you think someone to talk about about
them why don't you go on talk about that

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,110
so I kinda go myself

35
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,689
work to do I do not but that's 1 I'm
here to talk about today

36
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,079
so I joined

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,219
the comp no work for real experiments I
aim

38
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,940
2006 so effectually almost exactly seven
years ago now

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,459
I wanna join relax I was working in
operations security role initially so

40
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,239
your man Jim four walls security
configuration routers and switches you

41
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,239
know that that kind of work

42
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,540
with them you know it the time the
company had about 15 members have stuff

43
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,660
and to give you some idea of how much
we've grown. got about 15 min total

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,230
but when I joined a company we we've
hired about a hundred and twenty-four

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,110
even the last

46
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,660
year so the company significantly
different bus we started to grow

47
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,680
realize that the through the most
important part about payment processing

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
platform

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,580
was to cope so we paid a lot of
attention to security

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,879
you know about our hardware on all
servers in a for walls and so on

51
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,459
put all the the bits a platform added
the real work in terms of handling

52
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,840
sensitive data

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,530
handling data from the web and so on
that was code that we've written

54
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,150
in-house and still do today so realize
that picture what we need to start

55
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,739
looking at

56
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,700
was application security the business
said

57
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,810
well David you know how to write code
armed you know about security so

58
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,590
your no longer our operation security
person more you're gonna be

59
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,010
application security so thrown in at the
deep end

60
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,220
I didn't really know too much about
application security tone

61
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,680
I was given to high-level objectives by
the business

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,819
the first one was to review every bit of
code that we've written for the previous

63
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:35,730
seven years

64
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,459
um not such home problem second it
wasn't the most enjoyable part of my job

65
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,220
over the past six or seven years

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,159
I'm and then secondly insure that
everything we did in the development

67
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,870
a Department was compliant with the
relevant PCI requirements 90

68
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,890
PCRM boo no one likes PCI but

69
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,640
that was one of the two objectives are
as given at the time so the rest this

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,409
talk is gonna

71
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,170
you know explain how we started from
often and built out of

72
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,269
are over the past six years so

73
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,049
10 you must have to do im not that
initial review I kinda felt like to go

74
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:10,870
on the screen

75
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,230
after after the review would finish not
explain more in the second

76
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,690
put on the first thought I said that we
haven't done

77
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,009
any application security up until that
point up until this point and that's not

78
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:27,800
you know completely true because the Al
developers have had I been on

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,530
OS top 10 training course for any of you
who've been on those contrary courses

80
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,600
probably realize that what that means is
so mom

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,540
showed how developers how to exploit
vulnerabilities in web goats

82
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,259
and sent them back to the office I'm
they know how to write SecureCode

83
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,080
welcome back to appoint a little bit
later on in the story because that's

84
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,810
something

85
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,960
or try to tackle within our company and
the industry

86
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,600
a few years into this story so because
the business

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,790
thought the developers another what
SecureCode after that course

88
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,400
I the developers themselves responsible
for application security

89
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,590
it didn't work out too well as you can
imagine we basically what we had was

90
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,840
that the developers had

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,370
a checklist item so when they did that
peer review

92
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,570
they took this box and said yes free
from the west top 10 vulnerabilities

93
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,090
didn't really work too well so the first
thing I did was

94
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,970
I'll take that first objective months
ago on a county to review or this legacy

95
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,000
com

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,940
we know even at that point the company
been gone for seven years and we were

97
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,509
still

98
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,400
fairly large in terms of the big
costumes we have the transactions were

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,440
processed

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,820
there was still of coal so we have to
take a risk based approach initially

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,190
there was no point in me start him

102
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,740
that I review the legacy code on some
buried

103
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,910
a way back home web service also service

104
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,000
where I needed to start was out XML

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,840
I web service which is the very cool
part about payment processing engine

106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,740
and I'll come back to that again later
in the story because we we've rewritten

107
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,960
not since

108
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,220
um and the web applications that are
merchants and customers use

109
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,440
so what actually meant was in the first
six months my job I reviewed about a

110
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,470
quarter of a million

111
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,419
loans have code um and it wasn't moist
cold

112
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,340
suppose you know you think I've brand
new applications and a nice to follow

113
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,509
nice to read

114
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,490
i'm talking about web applications that
were written in classic ASP

115
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,780
are talking about out XML Web service
which was almost exclusively for mm poll

116
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,660
that the had no you know development
standard applied to it over the years

117
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,210
so some other parts the cold we had like
normal to poll falls

118
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,550
with ten or fifteen thousand lines of
code in them okay so it wasn't really an

119
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,539
enjoyable

120
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:43,620
for six months and application security

121
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,440
well we started for books as you can
imagine I found security box in that

122
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,210
code

123
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,050
because if you've been run code for
eight years was 0 times in 2 application

124
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,910
security gonna have security problems

125
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,759
folk what we needed to them look at was
okay will stop projects and work to fix

126
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,810
all the legacy code

127
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,940
but what do we do to make sure that new
code does introduce new security

128
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,169
problems

129
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,069
no any application security person in
this room probably give you you know it

130
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:16,210
very similar first answer to that you
know I'm not answer is normally

131
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,090
something like

132
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,370
grown integrated security into your
software development life cycle

133
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,599
I care if you've ever worked in a
startup company on

134
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,550
you trying go to integrate things into a
software bug motorcycle

135
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,970
you might look a little bit like the
woman on the screen that because

136
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,590
that was kinda more reaction when I
realize we didn't really have

137
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,410
a software developer motorcycle to
integrate security into

138
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,430
so well i spose I had two choices

139
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,190
about time I could walk away until the
business year when you've got this

140
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,430
process will come back

141
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,770
I'm will to security which was really an
option

142
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,150
so what they did was i sat down with the
people who are responsible for

143
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,139
you no change in how code because they
must've been following some corn to

144
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:58,810
process

145
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,810
you know they must have been taken
requirements from somewhere and they

146
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,949
must have been formed some kinda process
to turn that into

147
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,660
something that was released into
production my K

148
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,280
so what we did is we Satomi wrote that
out

149
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,560
and we basically ended up with what was
a waterfall methodology

150
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,740
you know very basic form but I was
ultimately a waterfall methodology that

151
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,900
they were followed

152
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,500
some we sat down we too far enough but
the next

153
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,340
power the the next step I suppose a
problem the most important things

154
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,919
looking back and I've ever done

155
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,370
so one of the things I spoke to actually
last time I was here speaking how

156
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,719
compares two years ago was this I do
that the KISS principle

157
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,490
a keep it simple stupid okay don't over
complicate things

158
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,779
keep things really simple now

159
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,180
if we would have to learn from them I'll
try to take something like the marks of

160
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,430
St Alamo for the hold up to this release
more startup company

161
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,320
we would have got nowhere okay because
you try to go from of them

162
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,800
to lots all things in the STL sink

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,320
so what we did is we sat down and wrote
how this SCLC

164
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,430
I'm it was really simple literally a 1st
St elsie was

165
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,450
me he opened up a Visio diagram and

166
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,730
drawn out like for evil 6 quest I'm
little bit attacks on the feet warm

167
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,950
on the not was Rs TLC I know when I look
back I kinda cringed a little bit

168
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,190
thinking about that thats

169
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,910
the first thing we use but you know
that's the point was the business a

170
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,990
with up for it said okay would point to
this idea a defined process

171
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,750
and will include security in that
process okay so

172
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,390
there's lots of things you might want to
do from a security point of view

173
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,920
and those are things that we've we did
eventually add into the process but we

174
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,570
have to start simple

175
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,180
because if we have said from you know
that from straight away from taiwan if

176
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,080
we do said

177
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,890
we want develop a training won't risk
assessment threat model in security code

178
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,519
reviews

179
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,649
security test in and a few other things
on top it up

180
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:00,680
the business would have probably left to
the sunset this application security

181
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,320
work

182
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,560
sounds like it's a bit more effort in a
bit more investment number actually

183
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,450
willing to do

184
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,769
so we said okay the minimum that I would
like to have

185
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,269
is training for all developers security
code review

186
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,200
and security testing before anything
gets a release to production

187
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,410
saw security test in some time

188
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,720
we needed to look at I and it became
pretty obvious that

189
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,120
you know there's lotsa different choices
when you want to automate security test

190
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,730
in

191
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,130
what when it came to a web application
automation and misses Tucson yes then

192
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,019
the group we talk

193
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,420
this is probably due to what you want to
be used in Fallout

194
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,190
for a web applications at least we do
something slightly different for the web

195
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,180
services but

196
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,800
you know we're talkin P like five years
ago so

197
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,230
after i'd initially gone down a bit to
research was obvious perhaps we

198
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,480
was 10 what we needed to use for a test
in when I started to use up

199
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,140
in my security test in iPhone developers
and few able to come up to me insane

200
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,060
that's really cool how did you for not
problem or how do you

201
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,209
you know how were you able to roam
thousands or tens of thousands test

202
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,100
against a web application cause we'd
like to do that as well

203
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,310
so what we found was up not least
without developers

204
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,089
that if you know a clean Security Review
intestine

205
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,610
is important to avoid for them to go
lower if

206
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,140
if they want to be proactive about up
which I'll developers did

207
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,140
we decided that we would give them the
tools to be proactive

208
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,120
so we actually bought voice and services
still the case today a up

209
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,370
a professional or since the book sweet
for all developers

210
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,610
all key right and although security
stuff

211
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,800
nor is it mandatory for any those all
the rolls out sort of security to use

212
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,850
burp suite

213
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,959
I me for not some teams use a lot and
some don't

214
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,380
um what we give them not opsimath to be
proactive

215
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,339
for you know fairly cheap price to be
honest for books we

216
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,490
so as we progress you have this SCLC we
do the security code if you do the

217
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,700
security test the

218
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,339
and of the process and that itself
started the whole eye problems

219
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,200
we've Rs TLC because we started to fall
on

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,990
for issues after Q&A when we do not
reviews intestine

221
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,380
which one we looked at the moment we
could have easily found much earlier in

222
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,560
the process

223
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,839
so like a real simple example be
something like crypto graffiti

224
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,060
so developer Marois in the design
document is going to use

225
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,420
I DES from Christian

226
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,230
now free for not problem with his own
site use he literally has to hit

227
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,430
backspace

228
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,110
change one character and that problem is
avoided

229
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,600
if you of ordinance I'm problem after
Q&A

230
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,000
it might still be backspacing change
character

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,250
without them probably has to go back
through few I'm security code review

232
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,880
security test in

233
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,139
so we wanted away by den to foreign
problems and threats

234
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,529
want to leave in the STL say so again
after a little bit to research became

235
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,200
fairly obvious to me

236
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,740
that's right marlin was what we needed
to do because I didn't want perhaps

237
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,850
something

238
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,550
I mean ultimately the goal was to have
security review the design document

239
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,200
but didn't want us to other a deliver
ball

240
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,730
in the SDLC that says get security could
review the design document

241
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,870
I wanted something more repeatable not
something that we we knew that whoever

242
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,190
did that check

243
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,220
they appoint the same process to that if
it makes sense

244
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,470
so we started to use the marks of that
moment approach which is

245
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,029
you know what I assume pretty much
everyone does remiss not to infer a

246
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:36,860
modern

247
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,620
so we bought marks a threat modeling
book we use the marks a threat modeling

248
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,449
told

249
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,019
I'm basically a ploy did exactly as
marks of sign the book

250
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,370
what we found overtone there were things

251
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,519
in the box of process that didn't give
us value for from

252
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,750
for months for the time that we put into
it so of a top my head things that use

253
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,820
cases on the threat trees

254
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,260
you know Walsall Dec good and they have
a value

255
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,279
they weren't given first value for make
sense so we

256
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,709
we've modified that process over the
years so it's not exactly the same as a

257
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:10,170
march of the probe snow

258
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,670
Brisa a threat move an approach that
works for us

259
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,970
with the biggest turns into that you
know the the biggest a

260
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,389
in a woman my favorite things that we've
done over the years when it comes to

261
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,660
threat modeling and application security
in general

262
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,870
is moving threat modeling away from
being almost a

263
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,459
a security team exercise to something
that involves

264
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,560
a lot more people and the way that we
did that is we started playing a card

265
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,160
game

266
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,769
without developers and not just
developers you know we project managers

267
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,430
with you I staff with

268
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,250
with you a lot of different roles and
the way that we do that is we actually

269
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,410
adopted the marks of elevation a
privileges card game

270
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,190
so this was a a car deck marks of
produce that basie

271
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,709
with no going into all the details you
have different soups

272
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,160
up threats so pre-summit a normal call
Dec

273
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,440
and then you have you know eights 123
except for in the car deck

274
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm each one of those has a threat on k
so

275
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,440
you shuffle the cards do you outcall
it's everyone whose prime game

276
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,860
and then everyone who's playing the game
has to try and explain boy

277
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,620
the threat on their called applies to
the the occupational development

278
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,680
that you're looking out know when I read
that I was

279
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,860
skeptical I thought are you can't really
see

280
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,829
what benefit we're gonna get from play
my game board I thought

281
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,149
will try anyway marks of my cordova

282
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,790
the calls in the graphics in everything
you need to play the game

283
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,130
available for free on their website so
all we do is we we gotta love those

284
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,230
go to a deck oven printed really cheaply
throw marked in team

285
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,329
I'm started playing the game no

286
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,350
the amazing thing to me was from the
very first game

287
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,509
is people's after chewed to win

288
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,589
is something that its might surprise you
when you first play this game because

289
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,610
what we see is the developer of

290
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,410
who my favorite movies on document and
the swat the ball to the code

291
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,790
he wants to win the game so much he's
torn

292
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,420
so hard to form problems with these his
homework

293
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,430
and he sayin yeah I might have written
in this in his own doctrine

294
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,399
this problem could exist outside tried
incredibly hard

295
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,769
to foreign problems in their own
developments so Chris it knows the

296
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,440
security team thinkin

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,380
this is fantastic an overt or what we've
actually seen is

298
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,920
but playing this game with the
developers reform twice as many

299
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,649
threats as we did without plans Kagame

300
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,190
because in a way the card game acts like
a checklist again if

301
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,509
interview here from my talk two years
ago I can parse

302
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:48,420
I talked a lot about checklist somehow
the can be useful to security

303
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,860
but in a way this game is the same
because you will

304
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,459
always look at them analyze every single
threat

305
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,149
every single time you do threaten I came

306
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:03,490
does not support of Science around
warrior people

307
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,360
get so sucked into playing these games
are more they worked I won't go into

308
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,559
into detail here

309
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,280
born it's been incredibly effective for
us

310
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,110
so in the early days after you put the
first

311
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,500
SCLC together I'm week on a look at that

312
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,799
i spose looking back the answer was
obvious we have this Visio diagrams in

313
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,630
squares drawn on it

314
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,330
we look to them civil more nervous for
ever done this before

315
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,090
so how do we know if we've done a good
job my K

316
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,299
and we didn't i spose looking back it
was kind of obvious it wasn't great

317
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,160
what we decided to do was bring them in
external although

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,200
so this was in order looking at PCR you
always 0 components money those kind of

319
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,230
things

320
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,250
what you want to was doing was taken the
process that we had the phone

321
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,360
point out any problems in that process
and then look forward to projects that

322
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,520
we had put through that process

323
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,580
and tell us whether we had followed out
if that makes sense

324
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,919
saw it was not a pleasant experience

325
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,070
i spose the first time we did not alter
because

326
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,080
he also points L i spose again looking
back it's kind of obvious

327
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,820
lot have problems so in 2008 they had
thirty pages

328
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,500
all problems with that s TLC

329
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm not look at and think well compared
to 2009 I didn't do too much work

330
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,960
in that year but that isn't true and
I'll explain why and he doesn't let you

331
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,880
also came in

332
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,539
on pointed out what's a fundamental
problems with the SDLC

333
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,410
so even things like ok I we had a a
design phase and we said that we have a

334
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,650
design document we didn't even have a
template for the zones

335
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,160
so everyone was going off one zones and
different ways

336
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,840
we said we did security code reviews but
we didn't even produce evidence for the

337
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,600
afternoon tom had evidence is

338
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,160
if Rose Bowls now in the books I can
system so %um

339
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,539
some real fundamental problems with the
process

340
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:03,559
so what we did this week on a step back
and said okay we know some other things

341
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,580
work okay for us

342
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,789
port when we look at other witnesses
report we probably should just also

343
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:10,539
again

344
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,660
build something brand new sorry kinda
took a bizarre diagram

345
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,840
pretend it never existed I am based on

346
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,900
the auditor's report what we had seen

347
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,350
a in projects over the previous year
following an STL see

348
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,010
with them put that towards producing
something new okay so

349
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,280
11 for why I suppose what I would call
our first

350
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,730
proper SCLC together so do you want to
come back in 2009

351
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,660
and although they came out with a lot of
suggested improvements still

352
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,059
know though there were more kind of
following

353
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,210
i spose process improvements instead
I've you know

354
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,630
you don't even have a template for
design documents it was a que serve

355
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,799
you know when you go from good design
phase 2 development you don't have

356
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,390
things were entry and exit criteria to
find my case so

357
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,559
you know making sure now that we have a
a process that

358
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,789
you know more detailed a more refined

359
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,440
one of the things you're supposed to
talk to me but this point

360
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,030
was you know that I should be collecting
data about application security

361
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,600
collected metrics about what we do not
the time will be honest I thought

362
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,559
this sounds like a waste my time what
you'll see later in the story

363
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,140
two or three years later after this also
suggestion

364
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,539
it turns out that was one of the most
important things we ever did

365
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:36,080
I case ok a month but later on so than
in 2010 the board also back again

366
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,640
but at this point reforming the process
we we would look good

367
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,850
the two years with us yeah suggestions
and home from you later

368
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,360
what we also don't this point was build
a first abdel methodology was security

369
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,919
built in 2002

370
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,929
welcome back to the a jolt and security
a little bit later on

371
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,090
we can see that you're too was
struggling to foreign problems them

372
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,400
so not only with a look at the waterfall
methodology that we're looking at jobs

373
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,620
as well

374
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,460
the agile ALM was pretty solid because
we had to you all three years will serve

375
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,799
lessons that we learned from water for

376
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,900
but we could bring cross into the hajj
or process

377
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,880
and in 2011 they came back from a can
only give us two pages have

378
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,909
suggestions now I don't know if any view

379
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,080
out there who we don't have English as a
first language whether

380
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,909
that would nitpicking at the bottom
there might any sense you all

381
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,190
but basically what that means is someone
is trying really hard to foreign

382
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,860
problems

383
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,080
whether or no problems to be found okay
and that was the word that the order to

384
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,970
you stay said if you don't change
anything after this

385
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,750
you don't need to bring this back okay
so you can see that got

386
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,940
bring a text on water and allowed us to
make court rapid progress

387
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,380
with RS TLC I'm you know make that
mature break quickly

388
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,330
no we didn't bring them back last year
because we've hired so many people over

389
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,240
the past

390
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,409
I'm 12 to 18 months we will bring them
back in again

391
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:59,429
later this year just to make sure that

392
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,429
the processes haven't really changed
that much wanna make sure all the new

393
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:07,659
stuff still applying those processes
properly

394
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,000
so she started to progress through the
through the years

395
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,400
you know I we we do not a security
awareness training to begin with them

396
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,750
a lot was based on almost popped I'm I
cannot grow a lot of people

397
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,809
public still stall nowadays but that's
where

398
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:26,740
proved everyone started developer trying
back in 2008

399
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,590
book rushed home went on I started to
realize that will actually

400
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,970
that's not what I want I'll developers
to learn about

401
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,669
what I mean by that is the did I won't
help developers to

402
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:42,600
learn about understand a a small set a
vulnerability is

403
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,809
what you don't want them to understand
how to write SecureCode

404
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,659
okay I'm really the difference there in
a spy I've given

405
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,110
for conference talks on on their so you
can get a love

406
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,370
the information but Willingham tell you
next on the security ninja website

407
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,049
republished

408
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,490
it all for free basically we

409
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,640
develop something called the principals
have secure development

410
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,940
which is still a list of items problem
talking about sequence action and

411
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,890
cross-site scripting and so on

412
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,600
we actually talk about the things that
the developer Lisa do brought

413
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,010
so we talk about input validation output
encoding

414
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,890
ever have them secure communications and
so on

415
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,419
so that's how developers a tort port

416
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,179
to reinforce the other all times that's
language that we use is the security

417
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,150
team

418
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,309
throughout the SDLC so I'll design
document doesn't talk

419
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,530
you know in terms of vulnerabilities it
talks about that most principal so the

420
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:38,909
two

421
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,440
develop acid the following how they're
going to do input but they should

422
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,809
correctly another application

423
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,760
I'll security code reviews all were you
something music Texas House anthem

424
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,929
like got seventy on terms on

425
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:56,750
and everyone was all items is mapped to
wannabes principles

426
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,400
so when rosa books about the development
can see well okay

427
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,220
that was on said no I'm its output
encoding

428
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,460
all that was on said no and its logging
in order tickets on

429
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,539
may be logged in credit card information
whatever might be

430
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:13,880
and the times when we raise a book you
know we might mention up

431
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,740
you know lack of input vibration could
lead to seek one injection

432
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,440
but we don't go off on attendant about
what secret injection is

433
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,070
we focus on which principle has been
violated

434
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,919
and what changes the developer needs to
make to ensure that application

435
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,190
temperaments up principle

436
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,809
successfully mother said or the
information on others on the security

437
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,760
men to websites if you want

438
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,940
presentations and documents the
standards to use that principled

439
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,070
approach itself

440
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,320
it's all on the website soap

441
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,100
wanna do things result it's too early on
and this is something the company

442
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,390
support anyway but its chairman the
knowledge that we have

443
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,200
see you seem ready to talk about I'm he
doing a conference talk so that's one

444
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,150
example

445
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,029
but you know even the fact that we
developed this principals have secure

446
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:04,860
development approach to move early stuff
for free

447
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,200
we've developed open source I
application security tools that

448
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,159
started off arm as a way for us to be
better internally

449
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,350
on we've released those exterminate them
one hmmm I talked about

450
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,130
at two years ago here how can parse on
we've just released a static analysis

451
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,830
program

452
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,490
free clips little to Tom a tiny bit
later on in this talk

453
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,960
and something else that would be really
soon shortly as well

454
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,299
does not serve lot of things that we do
not share in our security knowledge

455
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,380
externally

456
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,950
one of my favorite ones probably over
the years has been the fact up

457
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,600
your we're financial services company
with nothing to do with the security

458
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,730
industry really

459
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,970
I'm review made it onto the front page
of Slashdot

460
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,919
for positive reasons for security I
contact we'd written on a security block

461
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,880
normally don't eat on payment processes
and upon the front page of Slashdot

462
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,090
from the been compromised someone stole
more the data

463
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,029
so it's something I was proud of so as
we saw that grows company the company

464
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,970
structure internally started

465
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,210
change so i spose initially

466
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,510
a developer a development home was mice
was what you expected to be one big

467
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,900
development department

468
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,760
and every developer kinda ripon every
product or service

469
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,960
what we've changed who is this I do you
have small

470
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,190
product focused teams I wanna mean by
that is

471
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,600
we've got teens if I like 45 people

472
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,429
and they're responsible for the you know
management owning

473
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,100
development of a a certain sector
products

474
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,340
so external web applications for example
thats

475
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,179
one small t any change those rare
occasions

476
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,620
happens through this wantin and we have
the same for

477
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,450
internal applications our XML Web
services and some

478
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,470
what that means from a security point of
view is is something really good

479
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,130
because before you have to try and teach
every developer about every problematic

480
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,220
could occur

481
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,789
in every application service that we
work on

482
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,260
no depend on what you work on the
security

483
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,150
issues a significantly different she
could be working on

484
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,799
you know a back-end web service that
connects directly to a bank over private

485
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,740
connectivity using a proprietary
protocol

486
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,460
all the next day you could be working on
XML Web service

487
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,909
lets web face in that literally anyone
can send requests to

488
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,539
there's a a difference in what the
developers need to understand how the

489
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,809
need to protect cope

490
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:36,570
so what we've been looking in ways that
allows us to give

491
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,679
the developers extremely talkative
develop for education

492
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,000
so we get them generic overview of
everything you need to know

493
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,330
well then we'll sit down with them and
say look we talked about

494
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,830
to economic woes a sherman input
validation

495
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,169
18 the generic sense but he is exactly
how you

496
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,299
a ploy to in the application you work on

497
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,600
what the way down to the code level so
we'll go some say well

498
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,110
know if it's if it's the modern web
applications that we use will use

499
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,490
the enterprise security AP on from OS

500
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,210
so I can go to some say look if you call
this method in this way

501
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,559
you cannot was a synonym for violations
take care

502
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,190
K so it's allowed us to to tell them
exactly what we want them to know rather

503
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,679
than

504
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,470
tryna tell them about everything

505
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,480
so I can look back we kind of had a %uh
three different phases have automation

506
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,980
so we have a very early one

507
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,429
where talked about burp suite and then
after that second-order

508
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:36,970
where the altar told him start back to
metrics and so on

509
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,340
icon to realize that I didn't want to be
doing a lot about work manually

510
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,049
so they were talking about collect im
metrics Creighton all the trolls

511
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,500
creating reports

512
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,610
and all those kinda things I thought
well I could probably write software

513
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,970
don't do that for me I K so

514
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,299
out about all the I wrote PC software
that that

515
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,230
ultimately got released as an open
source to my school bag mission

516
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,860
already starting for the first time in
like two thousand on

517
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,429
the late 2010 I think the first public
release

518
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:10,950
has been downloaded about 15,000 homes
since m

519
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,510
I'm and basically is the tool that we
use for all about security code reviews

520
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,520
into me

521
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,409
so the checklist they talked about
before with the 70 questions on

522
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:23,190
there within this application unemployed
complete im

523
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,620
to check list for application or service

524
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,320
it does all the things I don't want to
im so I don't know if you have

525
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,399
this product also love the UK and
Ireland but

526
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:36,740
River Park or mister muscle which is
from a cleaning product

527
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,809
and his slogan is I that he loves the
job that you had

528
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:45,240
and i spose in white this tool was the
missed the muscle for a security code is

529
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,919
because

530
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,950
it did all the work that I hate them
that need to be

531
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,799
needs to be done you know collecting
metrics to all the trials

532
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,760
Creighton reports and so on I just don't
like doing it myself

533
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,220
so the software to care about force what
it was also doing it was given us a

534
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,260
database

535
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,190
that we could refer to any torn to get
loads of different information about a

536
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,860
security code reviews

537
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,990
welcome back to one that was important a
little bit later on

538
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,720
one who things we did this point is we
realize that

539
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,220
I'm probably everyone knows that we
realize that she way

540
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,309
we're getting a lot more time a lot more
money

541
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,380
a lot better tools than we had to test
our releases

542
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,640
so we went along and we decided well
we'll make friends because you were

543
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,250
right

544
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:33,090
and we'll figure out well okay what
tools they have that we could probably

545
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,029
use as well

546
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:38,710
so we found that they have this tool
from IBM called green hat

547
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,899
which is expensive fall more expensive
from

548
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:45,610
I could you know get bought from a
security point of view

549
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,120
by see what that does is it allows into
to automate it s not about

550
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,409
XML Web service so what does it submits
an XML request

551
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:56,649
tidal submit valid and invalid data and
then

552
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:00,769
do you wait and see whether service
relax as you expected to

553
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:04,080
not does does not sound like something a
security could use

554
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,210
I did to us so what we did as you know
shamelessly we copied and pasted

555
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,470
the test that they created gave a blow
to security tests and said can you run

556
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,890
bows every night

557
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,870
as well they added af into the MOT test
in

558
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,510
so that service for the past you know
few years it had

559
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,750
before a $500 security test run against
an automated manner

560
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,769
every single night I'm because we wanna
made friends with you I am basically

561
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:32,659
copied their work

562
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:35,919
we're able to use a tool that the
business had confidence in

563
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,019
without spending a penny 2.0 stances to
do vendor selection to implemented

564
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,840
or even to manage it we don't even
managed to talk to you I takes care of

565
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,970
force

566
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,710
so if you've got a queue I departments
and you wanna make application security

567
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,269
better

568
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,789
they've probably got some things are
going to be useful

569
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:56,490
so won't do things we we did is this
company started to grow is

570
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,230
30 the owner love real experiments
founded a new payments company

571
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,950
I'm not gonna go into the details what
they do but it's different to relax

572
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,049
there's no credit cards involves is no
PC or anything like that

573
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:11,690
well the problem was I was kinda sweat
too much was a little bit like the lady

574
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,730
on the screen at

575
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,840
at this point was that the come along
and support her all the developers a

576
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,250
common

577
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,950
from outside the business will holler
new developers

578
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,649
on that waterfall approach you can use
them to slope we're not going to use

579
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,529
that you need to be at all

580
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:31,399
and you need to have at least the same
level of securities you have for relaxed

581
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,470
so I thought there would win okay
everything that we've put together for

582
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,950
the past couple years

583
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,610
in relax with developers that we've
trained and educated and we've

584
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,950
built the process to support application
security

585
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,010
calmly move out and dropped into another
company

586
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,850
and hope that it works seamlessly was
pronounced is the kind of

587
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,500
yes and no we did bring everything
across

588
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,799
so we do have an agile methodology that
includes risk assessments right moments

589
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,220
few

590
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,210
code reviews security testing I'm when
necessary external Penta s

591
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,100
when it wasn't you know completely
smooth because you know as anyone

592
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,289
will tell you if someone says they're
gonna do our job development

593
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,190
that actually means the public into him
one of about a thousand Weiss

594
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,250
seen it actually go on figure out what
how will they actually going to do that

595
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,659
and now when you look back that's not
too different to what I had to do in

596
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,169
the very early phases of the story what
we had to figure out how

597
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:29,659
relax for actually morton software

598
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:32,659
so what we found was up not worth

599
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,960
we could bring security into the saddle
methodology

600
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,960
bring brand new developers in off the
street put them through our education

601
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,830
process

602
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,330
and we could still to application
security at least as well as we would do

603
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,299
and relax

604
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,890
arcade what we've also seen as for me
some unexpected benefits from a

605
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,210
more scene is because power play allowed
us for the first time

606
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,570
to jus our security approach in
something that was brand new

607
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,809
because before that we were just fixin
legacy code on out into legacy code me

608
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,830
like this was the first time we built
something

609
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,510
completely new following our security
processes

610
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,970
reload come up from nap and more
specifically

611
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:16,310
this improve security and relax a couple
of years down the line when we go went

612
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,280
through a phase

613
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,540
of building everything brand new and
also to not again in a minute

614
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,909
because what we did recover pay was get
them to implement things like the

615
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:30,139
enterprise security API from OS to
implement cross-site request forgery

616
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,409
controls for example

617
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:36,770
and then we can belong to build brand
new web applications and relax

618
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,530
we found that we could just copy and
paste almost almost literally copy and

619
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,220
paste

620
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,550
what we put together for current pay on
a point to relax

621
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,300
so that means that now a few years down
the line we've got two different

622
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,810
companies two different sets a
developer's

623
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,609
who's the same security libros the same
control same education probes and so on

624
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:59,960
which makes a security training reviews
intestine significant easy

625
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,359
because about successful car prime relax
at work I we want to secure our john

626
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:05,140
approached

627
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,810
so tools and the 2011 we moved from

628
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,980
relax across not as well because weed on
the hard work I've put in place in the

629
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,660
first place for current prime

630
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,040
loan what didn't work and I'm reply that
into

631
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,140
care relax some everyone's be not

632
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,230
following the secure at all methodology
for about 18 months now

633
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,540
so wanna do things you can do to relax
star Tim around 2011 was

634
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,329
basically rebuilding everything no I
talked about

635
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:38,339
earlier on you know with you know about
three years lobac in the story from

636
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,810
where we are at this point

637
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,750
how we have these poll fall from ten to
fifteen thousand lines of code in on

638
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,119
classic ASP web applications we

639
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,770
quickly realize that as we were growing
fast we couldn't

640
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,630
scant no we couldn't implement the
config choose

641
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,089
got a merchant's wanted that we wanted
to implement

642
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,359
so we decided will occur we just need to
Stop actually building everything again

643
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,470
so we started with the very call part
about say

644
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:09,270
service so I'm gonna give you a bit more
detail on

645
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,510
on on this in second but this was the
first woman relaxing we could build

646
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,910
something completely brand new with
security

647
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,250
in it from Taiwan not do something brand
new this was if

648
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,910
the most critical service for the
business if up service

649
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,780
is down on available then is like
fifteen thousand companies like com

650
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,920
process called prime

651
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,990
so it's pretty important to us

652
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,320
whatever settlement slide is but
building security and

653
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,650
to this from day Wong are so that we've
seen the expected benefits from Dune

654
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,970
what I mean is any security personal
talk to a built-in security in from day

655
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,849
one and all those kind of things

656
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,109
you will tell you that if you do that
you should end up with fewer security

657
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:51,420
books and I'm

658
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,440
and so on and that's what we've seen

659
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,410
so everyone whose group on the service
and does work on the service was horrid

660
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,579
after all this application security
stuff started

661
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,609
on the came in with almost no security
knowledge for everything that they've

662
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:05,250
learned

663
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,470
they've learned from out Ryan approach

664
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,130
saw this XML Web service processes

665
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,859
over 20 billion-euro in payments every
year

666
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,560
and I think that's what you closer to
$25 billion euro at this point

667
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,570
for troll 15,000 merchants

668
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,800
so we were that was initially poll I'm
we were trying to build a Java

669
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
replacement

670
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,339
and move everyone across two sons read
create the first

671
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:34,710
proof of concept version but we don't
270 security code reviews

672
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:40,190
over in about 200,000 Monza cold we've
only from nineteen security box

673
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,290
in most 270 reviews now

674
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,250
your initial reaction might be well
David you might not be very good

675
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,089
application security or your team is a
good phone books

676
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:54,750
book to guard against that we have pent
escort regular again says

677
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,940
we're even harder to external communist
common review the code as well

678
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,450
various points to be from nineteen
security box in those 270 releases

679
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,440
actually sitting in for a little bit
more 11 oppose 19 books were found in

680
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,619
the first two

681
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,369
kinda proof-of-concept releases tool
that actually means

682
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:15,970
is in the following 268 reviews run from

683
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,810
8 security books when you dig into a
little bit deeper

684
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,540
does I books were found across four
different reviews

685
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,160
Soltani what that means is we don't 270
reviews

686
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,060
a bath 263 oven past first or

687
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,750
okay so that when I say we've seen
expected benefits have doing all these

688
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,619
things in STL seem try and developers
and so on

689
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,800
this is what I mean by that

690
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,780
so as we continue to grow and power play
was grown reelection grown we got more

691
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,859
more developers that men who produce
some

692
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,740
more and more code bought this is where
we'll

693
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,720
you know the the the things your doctor
told me at the end of 2009

694
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,210
suddenly started to make sense because
your terms tell me collect all this

695
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,520
information about your security code
reviews

696
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,599
when you do them how much code eccentric
cetera

697
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,560
and as I said earlier I thought that was
probably wasted holding back then

698
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,820
when I started to realize that ribs
group do so many releases and produces

699
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,750
so much cold

700
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,220
I probably couldn't reviewed all
properly I had to take a step back

701
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,950
and federal how do we get the business
to give me more application security

702
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,570
resources

703
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,220
when I thought about adding three years
was a day to the week ago bach

704
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,170
one sequel queers against and give the
business all corns views

705
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,380
of that day sir I'm like kinda figured
out was that

706
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,180
at that time I knew more about anyone
else more than anyone else in the

707
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,280
business about

708
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,550
you know how much coal be released how
many books we have which teams to

709
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,730
produce the most Co

710
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,720
which teams needed a bit more security
trying because they had more books than

711
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,670
others

712
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,720
towards I would go to the business and
so we're OK

713
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,750
we have this limits have about fifteen
hundred lines of code today that we

714
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,320
think are you human from review

715
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,579
properly in the bank based on all the
reviews that we're doing now

716
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,119
we go while you're both of which means
the quality the reviews a decrease in

717
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,670
and then we looked at how to pay and
said Well this is

718
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,770
how much colder how often they're
producing a marriage or methodology

719
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,200
when we moved to that from the real
exporter view this is what that would

720
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,380
mean

721
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,640
what actually meant was that I could sit
down with them I could set up in 2011

722
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,430
are you personally completed on 1050
security code reviews

723
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,099
Karim 246,000 mourns have covered

724
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,310
so I looked at all the data we had no
matter what car pay we do and we made

725
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,910
some estimates I said

726
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,970
because we're everyone's gonna be on how
John in 2012

727
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,710
I was estimating we do about three times
the amount to review surround bow

728
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,589
450 and covering about 300,000 mourns Co

729
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:52,130
among bro got down we started to realize
that I couldn't do all that for myself

730
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,550
and the fight Troy to there was going to
be lots of work that just wasn't gonna

731
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,790
get on most important things

732
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,880
so we went to the business in the
business said way up

733
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,839
those obviously a case the horn another
application security resource

734
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,690
because you've got all this great day to
to back up your request

735
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,980
what I thought was important to go back
to the business in the last year

736
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,920
on explain to them how 2012 actually
mapped

737
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,220
to my estimates so what we found was up
I said I do 450 reviews we did for 199

738
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,339
I said that we do about 300,000 mourns
code

739
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:29,829
and we did 294 if I K but to give you an
idea

740
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:32,859
of well we all from a natural point if
you know

741
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:36,220
in the first two months all 2013

742
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,950
we did mall security code reviews than
we did in the whole love 2011

743
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:45,300
form waterfall and we will do on average
about 50 or 60 reviews a month

744
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,500
ball what you find is the scope is
significantly smaller than the reviews

745
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,040
we would do and Walt

746
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,619
so we're talking very small review just
quite often

747
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,700
I K so the under the column for the
latest phase water mation

748
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,030
will look you and i own I'm working on
again

749
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,790
Ramon lead on that date a nice start to
collect him years ago

750
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,480
because book a stay to allow me to do
was figure out well

751
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,650
how can I help al developers more

752
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,829
and you know you can go out and the boys
static analysis tools from boy web

753
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:18,819
scanners and so on

754
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:22,680
because we have three-and-a-half years
with a daytime

755
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,079
I could go back and look at them figure
out where exactly al develop a struggled

756
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,490
wanna remark to that not all the books
we raise we figured out

757
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,030
but almost all the problems at all
developers had where are the input

758
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,940
validation

759
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,460
open code in or in exception handling

760
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,690
psalm we started work on

761
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,670
tools in-house to help al developers
reduce or remove those problems from

762
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,630
Michael

763
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,359
so the first thing we sought to work on
was a plugin for Eclipse

764
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,550
okay so Cali good morn quarterman
started working on this

765
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,630
like to the first job I gave him when he
joined company some thrown in at the

766
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,440
deep end

767
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,300
I want to reuter real time stuff conoces
plugin for Eclipse

768
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,680
because soap not the easiest job I've
ever than I've ever given anyone

769
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,980
so he came in and he looked at this
relook the psychology behind this

770
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,589
I'm basically there's better you get
better results if you tell someone about

771
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:18,460
a problem

772
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,630
assumes I'm make that mistake problem
went for months down the line

773
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,319
exposed economy make sense when you
think about it to what we've done is

774
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:26,720
we've developed this plugin

775
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,700
that analysts and developers code as
they want their code

776
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,390
on if they introduce a security ball for
told about it immediately

777
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,359
too since I'm I is you know they had
made a syntax error

778
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,440
we use the same on Norton system it's an
eclipse never answer looks the same to

779
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,510
the developers

780
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:48,359
and we tell them there in that they just
made a security mistake

781
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,650
I K like understand literally is a
partner

782
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,319
bit of code what that will mean if I
don't remove

783
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:59,339
so we've really stop was an open source
tool has been actively develop

784
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:02,530
so if you I think the website is ESPP

785
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,760
plugin dot com number if you to search
for ASP security program

786
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,069
your for not or goal in the securing the
website and search for PSP your phone

787
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:14,460
all the information that so what do the
things that we found

788
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,579
was up %uh developers made love output
encoding the state's

789
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:21,630
not because they didn't understand
output encoding

790
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,670
because most the time they got it right
we phoned

791
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,690
amused to use P falls a lot

792
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,339
you for now enjoy espy said they have
what one or two places where they just

793
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:31,730
forgot

794
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,800
on to do open coding so

795
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,190
that would cool some profound a security
review and we thought was gonna be

796
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,150
a small to waive doing this so we're 0 a
Python script

797
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,990
the every normal rooms through the
project directory scans through every

798
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,109
JSP

799
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:52,900
look for places in most polls whether
potentially mixed

800
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,060
output encoding a crate thanks to your
pool

801
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,470
emails the developer linked to it they
going to review the following terms and

802
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,359
if I site

803
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,790
it's a false positive basically a hatch
is created Nov

804
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,310
you know that specifically the code the
morning on soul into the not bothered

805
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,390
without again

806
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,640
and the only left with issues that they
need to work on

807
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,410
we're still form tonight a bit so it's
not been released yet but we will be

808
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,540
open source not as well in public

809
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,510
mournful to storm what we found is that

810
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,180
to small group for developers who use
the Eclipse plugin

811
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,060
I'm the output encoding toll have
completely eliminated

812
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,319
the condom books we wanted to eliminate
okay so we'll find out what works for

813
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:36,770
all developers 1 percent to all
developers in the company

814
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,290
what the early signs are encouraging at
least

815
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,020
so of this is the last chapter in the
story

816
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,440
void ab to die this is what we're
working on right now missus

817
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,030
you know native mobile app development
his work with the talks this week I've

818
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:56,420
give me a few interests and ideas but
what we found was that

819
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,970
when you look at security or application
security those

820
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,630
that kinda principles level problem
before my abilities

821
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,490
you for not when you look at the
vulnerabilities in web apps web services

822
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,130
on the mobile app's

823
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,560
you don't really need to change the way
that you you teach developments

824
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,440
you know store something in securely is
the sign with the a store near

825
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,630
in a database server on the back and the
weather the storm and a sequel like

826
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,329
database

827
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:23,380
on the farm so what we found actually
this

828
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,910
and this is how I feel like improve the
everything we've done over the past few

829
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,500
years

830
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,760
has been successful is that

831
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,819
senior developers that rabin whole I
wanna be employed

832
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:39,030
in this period of application security
relax

833
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,569
so everything I knew we we had told them
i sat down they broke the devote the

834
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:46,339
design documents in ok text documents
for

835
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:49,369
the mobile app on the back and web
services

836
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:53,180
and one came for security review I ask
for almost

837
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,400
0 changes so what I meant was

838
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,430
because you've ever seen the developers
had learned and been through over the

839
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,069
previous years

840
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:04,910
before I wouldn't have been her and I
would have built the application service

841
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,470
as per that is on a program

842
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,910
they would have had something that was
very secure so to me

843
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:15,079
I can look back over the those you know
44 views this story

844
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:21,260
and sign up yeah we made mistakes
bottles money's been successful

845
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,040
port I think what's always important to
do is look back

846
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,210
and point out that you know the the
Paulson story well

847
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,910
we want may be so successful things I
would do different maybe

848
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,589
if I was going through this all again
from very well I came

849
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:40,150
soak the first thing I would do this
talk back to me security

850
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,619
metrics on application security data
from day one

851
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:47,089
because it took me two years I'm order
to

852
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:50,760
I am you know before starting collect on
information

853
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,559
and what we've seen if used on the
morning is that tasers allowed me to

854
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,960
prove I need more security resources

855
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,260
and has allowed me to produce tools up
actually

856
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,940
help the developers with the specific
problems they are having in our business

857
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,809
the the thing up makes me i spose sound
a little bit

858
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:13,450
about the state on the front I didn't
have it from Taiwan

859
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:18,020
like home stand here and tell you which
security

860
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,260
tasks all work makes the biggest changes

861
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,280
in the early phases a of your
application security

862
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,490
storage is it develop a training is its
right move members

863
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:32,849
code reviews I have no dice her to prove
which ones

864
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:36,710
make the biggest difference no to me I
think it's a combination a public threat

865
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,559
moslem

866
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,150
security code reviews and security test
in because you confirm

867
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:44,640
early part yes they'll see on the left
parts but I don't have the data to back

868
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,400
that up

869
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,220
okay you think I would say is if you
have but they took make sure you share

870
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:53,260
because I found all coins with people in
the business

871
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,730
who form updated useful than I would
have thought about so

872
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:02,260
know al team lead for example take data
from me on a monthly and quarterly basis

873
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,990
so they can give their developers more
focused and maurice was

874
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,440
realistic feedback when they do their
reviews we

875
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,940
report data from our database to the
management team

876
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,730
every single month so the management
team just to see application security

877
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,520
data

878
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,390
mainly because it's really easy for us
to produce and give to you

879
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,180
so want to do things that probably could
have happened early if you remember what

880
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:25,990
we're back up

881
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:30,109
the star of the story do know first
formal SCLC

882
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:34,040
kinda after those first six months it
happened after I do that review the

883
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,319
legacy code review

884
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:40,170
the legacy told to be honest they should
have happened at the same time

885
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,160
we could have started building a nest
the LC at the same time has restarted

886
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,839
those reviews

887
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,859
bought a drop down to the left bobble
bomb here without question

888
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:52,880
because it is a question I had when I
wrote this long

889
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,059
that I got the business to agree to
implement the first St elsie was

890
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,440
security built into it and so on

891
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,809
I think largely because of all the
problems we found when we look to the

892
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,300
legacy.com

893
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,510
before Detroit to get them to pro forma
net still see reviews intestine someone

894
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,950
from Taiwan would have been a successful
again I

895
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,490
I don't know it can go back and find out
the answer

896
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:20,849
the next won't use i spose more about
folks in on what developers need problem

897
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:22,900
what security people want

898
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,300
what I mean by that on ok 100 Korea
because I'm remote or mechanical from

899
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,210
all sides

900
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,680
is alternately see real developers when
you give them a security requirement

901
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,300
and see what they struggle with so if
you tell the money to the economic

902
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,510
allies Asian

903
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,579
thats phone sit down with them Watson
try and implement that

904
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:45,650
and you could be for now that what the
developers want what they need

905
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,569
issue to be a bit more specific so now
we go to developers and say hey you to

906
00:50:49,569 --> 00:50:51,200
do canonical is a shim

907
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,480
look to do that in your application or
service you need to call this method

908
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,720
I'm not taken care of because that's
only slightly different

909
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,180
remarks to a huge difference to how the
developers go about writing secure code

910
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,880
this one ok witness keep open issues
talking about cratia move

911
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,040
agree shown collecting that data that I
would do not earlier because it's driven

912
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,319
some small

913
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:16,800
decisions later in the story

914
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,680
and then the last one must live is
collection

915
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,190
the things I would do differently if I
can do it again first thing is that

916
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:27,150
elevation privileges car camera
mentioned earlier on

917
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,599
I do that from day one follows build
miss again now because it's been

918
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,940
song fantastic in terms of given us
better threat models

919
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,300
and find more security issues that it's
worth

920
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,869
was born in with paying the printer to
print those calls for you

921
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:46,760
a chat to you through the business
earlier because we start to collect that

922
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,500
data in about 2,000 normally do

923
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,349
really use it for a single shot with the
business to about 2011 so

924
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:57,960
maybe we missed some opportunities in
most two years are not small

925
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,480
I'm I'd I'd bomb the use of words in
Excel

926
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,720
more of a store in Anniston that you
gonna find useful

927
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,470
because before you had this school for
reviews

928
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,579
on our review day to enter into a
database it was in the spreadsheet

929
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:16,780
so I can very easily query about three
years with the data

930
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,119
before want the full picture over
application security history

931
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:24,420
over to go to go into Excel documents
and Word documents and some

932
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,650
and I must warm is to make friends we've
mocked him if you aren't

933
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,160
its first few ways convoy obvious Tucson
a little bit before

934
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,300
about you know arm you're using their
tools and maybe

935
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,280
just copy and paste network which is all
to me what we did

936
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,490
with your woman is the marketing
department what

937
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,520
we realized is obviously there the
better people with the skills and

938
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,670
knowledge about some things

939
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:54,430
and ultimately wall I always think the
biggest obstacle for security has been

940
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,910
up to sell security to the business

941
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,710
came and sell to the business something
which often costs money

942
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,960
if you pull the season to the SDLC
probably gonna slow down a bit

943
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,309
so go speak mocked him understand how
they sell things that people

944
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,690
was not necessarily want a boy but
they're still on the boy anyway

945
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,000
because marked enough marketing for
small

946
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,069
so go make friends with those people on
moon what makes them go to expose

947
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:25,260
so that's that's it for me today so I'm
if you have any questions feel free to

948
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,059
ask

949
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:30,430
are the small heater on Mon so slideshow
but not force us security ninja new get

950
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,680
the slides there

951
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,410
I'm not sure if there are any of the
comment box left phone number for

952
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,010
