1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,250
and don't know if someone's first
introduce me

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,120
this was the country's myself in a
minute cuz I

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,120
because my preference ran from the
shuttle I mean why I guess have your

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:17,270
attention now

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,769
on so a at as everybody ready to start
because I think I am

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,840
okay good out I'll take that as a yes

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,260
so a that the talk on

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,820
the colonel X the the cum laude from

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,910
from two years ago I'm it it was when it
was used in the

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,379
for you attacks that a well you meet me
injuries myself first son

11
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:45,550
I'm Julian and I i take things apart

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,649
figure work in and

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,539
7 he's one minute I'm

14
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,320
next 40 minutes I basically I'm

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,590
who what where when my stuff like that

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,670
a things you know about treated funds

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,790
I've you would understand the rest talk

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,560
bandana and the actual the technical
details for the bug

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,729
most the a so actually went to encounter

20
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,740
my slides about 12 percent have than
actually have words

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,220
I 21 percent pictures and then

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,380
I about sixty-seven percent sure six
times

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,329
so in and they're the kind ago in this
water

24
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:36,420
you know the beginning seller

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,640
I i sry figure how to best represent a
calendar

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,369
or something but I and bruises
self-explanatory so the

27
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,540
the has begun exploit the the first
confirmed sighting a bit

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,950
a conspiracy found I'm

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,369
a sample back in May of 2011 other these

30
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,619
this seems to be some indications that
that the me me even use in 2010

31
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,829
I or possibly as early as 2005 although
not significant work

32
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,969
I because this mother I

33
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,000
with anachronism with the the Medea

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,470
so I think probably at least 2006

35
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,160
for the for the absolute earliest you
that were

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,730
some regions amid around I'll sorry to
see that amendment

37
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,110
on so anyway I'm with actually
discovered at least

38
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,230
a at analyzed around August

39
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,650
I've 2011 I prices

40
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,170
for these are hungry and I think the
time

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,440
group a the the reason I discovered it
and then

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,739
and semantic a to the report

43
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,030
and then very much longer report I do
their research

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,569
and and disperse the promise to hold
kinda stuff also

45
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,080
if you go to Google you can find them so
I'm not gonna cover too much but

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,810
the actual to do stuff and his men talk
about this explained here so

47
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,930
I has officially ended in in November

48
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,349
and at inserted hatching and so forth

49
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,349
and then also did curiously

50
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,489
on that is that when I started looking
at it and

51
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,230
wall searching for for information about
it actually

52
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,209
discover that there is a a on a car
there's a

53
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,420
Chinese would say that actually had if
the the exploit on it for a couple of

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,849
days

55
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:29,159
min away I I do would have

56
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,690
but but the story was with that on in

57
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,010
and it was fixed in the patch with with
the December

58
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,150
on and then did not much happens for

59
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,349
about six months a and then I'm

60
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,650
the a

61
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,269
the referred is because the development
for for black hole

62
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,709
a family Street estimates this explain
and

63
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,750
a the time nobody actually listed

64
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,209
are up rather up I figure this out wall

65
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,040
didn't want 13 for something else I and
II so I found in

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,730
and area an email on the the snowbirds

67
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,430
a emerging threats mailing list person
is like here with this

68
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,639
this thing it doesn't work and I when I
saw that I was like I'm usually

69
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,400
recognized who that's that missus

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,699
that this explains so paley was it was a

71
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,620
in testing on like some beta test site
or something

72
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,500
for the Michael expected back in June I
am

73
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,830
and then newbie

74
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,800
are need doing the shopping in till
October when actually worked

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,540
so there is a is when the big news

76
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,930
was when it to was released both

77
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,350
cool expect kitten Michael Kucharek
secretive I

78
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,130
apparently the actual actually the same
almost the same code base by the same of

79
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,430
their

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,740
so an innocent it so it makes sense that
they of came out simultaneously cuz its

81
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,070
kind the same thing

82
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,080
a I think it is I think this one

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,050
think they sell for more than that one
thinkers the reason why it's

84
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,430
friended way the sale a

85
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,620
and after that time is the only one copy
a resolve the

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,720
on the XP kids copy of the experts at
every other

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,240
exploit kit I with and I'm

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,570
this is very little actually knew

89
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,960
input into the system is just it's just
kind of copying in carbon copying

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,550
a and its you can you cannot

91
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,220
if you accidentally would watch I

92
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,850
look at a bunch have experts on by six
wickets

93
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,250
you can it watch over time is I'm

94
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,880
its sort of like a a a like medieval

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,150
I'm that

96
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,610
movements you've likely medieval
manuscripts

97
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,440
a we're likely to scribe would
occasionally to use a smaller

98
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,720
but I over time you can because she
wants and build up

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,120
at in the image copy if parchment

100
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,180
cell I looking a lot of

101
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,319
have explored soon you can see where
where you can kinda follow

102
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
who crappy from whom and with the messed
up needed to copy

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,620
I am into actually I especially don't
actually have

104
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,300
if offended genetic tree a

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,130
that that is certain based on on that
circuit logic

106
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,630
anyway so for for Duke you everything
you want and you know about you who's

107
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,020
basically in this

108
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,400
a PDF that snippet out to

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,340
you to that goon done with this PDF from
semantic and you know it with me know

110
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,190
wanna knowbut do Kumaon where but it
would actually do anything with the

111
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,569
actual explain is

112
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,050
a his responses about the explain

113
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,800
and never actually seen the details
there was no way diversions documents no

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,460
something to give you the details aren't
in this on

115
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,509
no yeses whatever

116
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,310
you wanna know connecticut you can go
great with a document

117
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,979
good with a Google look at which page
for Duke you it's

118
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,830
as on them to talk with the part that's
not in there so

119
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,660
a it was the initial the did actually a

120
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,660
say that initial vector was a job a

121
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,060
Microsoft a Office Word document with
the head area

122
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,740
embedded Fontan had which exploited

123
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,620
the the font rendering engine in the
Windows kernel

124
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,060
because I am

125
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,810
the Windows kernel a many response

126
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,639
in current space in room 0 a

127
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,160
for for drawing pictures a

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,250
and I'm it seems current insane but was

129
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,430
Reza what on I I stumbled across

130
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,789
I this document on Microsoft's website
on

131
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:03,240
the reflected back in like nineteen
ninety 2002 make that

132
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,740
and it was I is this the the entire
document was a

133
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,349
media rationalization for one within the
GD I'm

134
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,930
layer into the current was a good idea
his whole areas reinvesting in hindsight

135
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,050
I'm and which is basically it says this
sort of thing

136
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,800
over and over and over again in
different ways in next my favorite

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,990
paper one is is a this one I where

138
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,039
where they at clean that making this
change won't affect

139
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,330
the that the tude a

140
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,450
seats you order with the three security

141
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,539
certification on anyway I gotta go to

142
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,649
if you wanna like laugh bunch going with
this

143
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,990
document here a tuning

144
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,910
a anyway so I was actually pretty actual
content to this message your betta

145
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,910
an actual a chance to cut and paste it
in your butt but is this is this is the

146
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,880
the smart message for some is like he
with his font export thing

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,730
a anyway there was back in June 2012

148
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,700
on in a bit and services with the
evolutionists

149
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,149
whereas on the initial

150
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,870
unit looks like those used in the attack
I'm

151
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,940
this was I the

152
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,250
within the hour in the a.m in the word
document it was a and

153
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,820
an embedded OpenType font I and

154
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,880
ok is everything or action makes me mad
reuteri is everybody here

155
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,360
firmly with Microsoft Active Protection
Program

156
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,830
okay so so Microsoft on

157
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,510
some before Patch Tuesday every month a

158
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,050
Microsoft ascendant vanced

159
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,160
notice to Ubuntu endeavors companies in

160
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,620
and I guess companies into for saying
here about to fix these

161
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,940
Mobility's I'm use the information you
know

162
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,959
en route for you to detect them the

163
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,430
the day that hackers out I and so
basically the the senate

164
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,820
advanced information so it's it so
that's why I

165
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,860
like every time a new cast comes after
Windows

166
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,709
I like Sourcefire McAfee its magical say

167
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,890
we detect this brand new thing eyes
because they they get advance

168
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,959
the advanced information three-year

169
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:23,519
anyway so a the

170
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,190
members I think you're only going to get
Center like November I love melody to in

171
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,250
was was from August so I

172
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,579
on it the the particular copy

173
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,740
there was and that was that economy
reconstructed and his

174
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,839
and was converted from a new embedded
OpenType font into a regular

175
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,279
true type font any case

176
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,519
the things that had the the peeler
removed

177
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,190
there was a entire Windows kernel device
driver and move on

178
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,860
a which was very much %ah code an easy
read all that out

179
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,970
and all the short haired the all the
concert at the Royal that up to you

180
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,050
arm and at the figure will basically

181
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,370
and if you don't basically the

182
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,740
how Disney Sea get to the bike in the
kernel so they could fix said

183
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,779
and how you build it back to detect this
on

184
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,890
the the nominees for this then they
didn't the nurses actually left the the

185
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,870
actual important for the exploit and

186
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,050
it was actually on that is still
functioning to kidnapped and send out

187
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,779
actually

188
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,250
working exploits except this time an
accident

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,220
so a any case through the

190
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,750
at v black hat version so I I haven't
actually seen the

191
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,480
a information haven't actually gotten
anybody to feel like the Wii version

192
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,130
for conversion was back in June a better
looking at the current versions

193
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,610
a basically the 32-bit version

194
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,470
is almost bit wise identical to that the
Mac version but different from

195
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,649
the diversion and and then promised
every other explicate

196
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,120
is it was identical to this one even
with the same name

197
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,260
me and if there's one next week you have
if it was when

198
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,540
I which means the name fun to ABCDE

199
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,750
have mister Dexter but otherwise
identical

200
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,100
you I mean that with the rise again for
the finals next to each other

201
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,320
its like every single bit is the same a

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,019
and with you think curious thing is is
the 64-bit version

203
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,139
and I don't know where that came from
exactly i mean it

204
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,149
looks like it's driving 3d version I
direction

205
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,310
these are all we closed tell which
direction you know who's going

206
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,690
and 64 bit version is almost a single 32
bit version

207
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,120
by with a few other small changes which
I heavens

208
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,870
I'd and as yet unclear if the MIDI did

209
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,370
the files is identical the all the fun
Tabler identical near the exact same

210
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,440
places

211
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,860
all the jokes the fighter constant on it
at

212
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,639
on this one we were at this I depends on
a lot of time and

213
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,540
a prolonged personal I had

214
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,570
I'm touches on the exploit

215
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,100
I'm see a everybody uses the identical

216
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,360
through the phone program I am although
the

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,810
the exploit kits that first couple bites
are not allowed

218
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,519
and it's an actual effect the execution
if it that I'm not

219
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,639
not sure why if I was on purpose for I'm
a dozen

220
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
really change things but I don't know
why would you know that I'm

221
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,529
purpose um I am I so

222
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,950
on you

223
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,950
that know so here we have the additional
unit promisingly differences

224
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,720
shellcode that was included in the media
experts agree

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,760
everybody standing in their cousins I
its

226
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,870
it's the I'm well I'll explain how we
examine it but it's

227
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,579
is basically live you can just drive you
can also Cody and a certain set the font

228
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,639
no just magically on it II its

229
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,089
on is very it's a very reliable explain
no explain how that works

230
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,230
and in the technical part for in any
case the

231
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,510
64 bit version on its

232
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,300
its way we she's mostly mostly some of
that's what changed

233
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,130
I and also the the middle part of the on

234
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,470
I at the explain where where it meets
the

235
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,639
which the global VM state a

236
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,079
in the 3G version in with me x1 rate
into that

237
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,130
structure but I and 64-bit version makes
about sixteen

238
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,329
I have been precisely figured out but
they all are quite yet

239
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,199
I'm that Gallagher through the

240
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:38,440
the victim and an initial cousin with
them is that

241
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,860
the q1 it is a good movie

242
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,420
the device driver from within the phone
itself its its

243
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,699
community map the kernel a by the time
the

244
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:52,139
the shoulder runs the a the funny thing
with the

245
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,709
shoko that Woods is is that you could
have never acts many miles before was it

246
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:01,120
it was written actually work on Paul
32-bit and 64-bit colonels

247
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,050
which is on make the you could drop in
your system and rip your text you

248
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,019
correctly

249
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:08,470
I it was it was actually the really well
written

250
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,610
and I have no idea who wrote it

251
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,029
because I've never seen it hun on

252
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,079
most other experts live

253
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,490
that sell in with an Applebees

254
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,350
had the ex everything you and no doubt

255
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,540
I and then the documents begin its busy
there's a typical

256
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,079
download exact from that from the on

257
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,199
expect to get website and and and and

258
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,310
and stuff like that it's its permits on
than standard

259
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,980
down the exact so cute except on

260
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,470
I'll except that it deals with like
moving them the

261
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,470
the guys from my curfew tonight the
allowance to the

262
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,079
and DL or whatever on and some general
beginning

263
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,170
you don't actually have to United you do
you think the IU privilege level stuff

264
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,380
though in in you in the show could

265
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,620
a because you're the it into bringing
the context the

266
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,269
went through to q2 sis anyway will you
explain

267
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,899
in a minute so a good backup

268
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,970
did more introduction so a

269
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,839
a user should have true type fonts right

270
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,480
okay here is never heard heard what font
is

271
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,300
okay so anyway they were there for
months the rivet maps

272
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,839
and Anna and PostScript scheme long and
bitter

273
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,690
dewey pander to punch the stuff into
this true type which doesn't

274
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,579
following to do believe hands a and so
forth its

275
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,920
basically the in

276
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,269
for a for PostScript you things like
this

277
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,360
if it's a it's a quadratic curve is an
appointment

278
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,990
its new you you you try these out are
you missing constructor

279
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,449
I'm characters my outlines few months 54
points

280
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:03,540
and then the new you

281
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,789
withdrawn at you then master I said and
so forth its

282
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:12,530
and you know 334 to accept on

283
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,390
there is a releasing issues though if is
you get down to I'm

284
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,549
as your sample size approaches the the
size of your

285
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,120
at actual drawing the characters

286
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,100
I you into getting dropouts and

287
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,919
for it easily make if so when the fight
is really small

288
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,309
big becomes completely unreadable I mean
like weakness

289
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,630
no on

290
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,960
Nyquist has some things to say about
that so the the way that a

291
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,150
with the tree types solve these have
avoids the summer problems are solved

292
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,530
its problems with that its

293
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,660
is that when the when the at when the

294
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,850
I'm pixels get really big unleashing the
character

295
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,030
minutes very small pint-sized a it

296
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,400
it switches it makes a bunch of the part
to the outline

297
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,470
thicker so that his more pixels I

298
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,580
and so for this is like will be like
when it was it like 72

299
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,850
points or something I listen to be would
be like if

300
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,049
butter that is 10 points and I'm

301
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,380
and the the things that the

302
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,720
me even fatter I is

303
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,870
is likely after in a program to do that
and so a

304
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,600
is a if he's citizen the

305
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,340
the information on how to link make
things better in infinera is the points

306
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,330
is changes

307
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,750
is there if the control value table and
it looks like this and

308
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,010
and looks like this that you actually if
you really wanna know you can do

309
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,600
go to google and type in that true type
fonts pack

310
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,809
and at Apple Microsoft and

311
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,289
a doobie all have liked huge sections
the website bed

312
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,049
you go into a men's t tell on like all
love this

313
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,080
this stuff like that I'm not cover that
on better

314
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,250
you can see were here I'm dislike
between these two points as you can see

315
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,270
the

316
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,669
thickness the characters change on

317
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,900
nap there to you and its is basically
these points

318
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,970
this is these places where the before
value people kicks in

319
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,650
and I'm was making changes on

320
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,080
so the

321
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,130
30 this is not like a when you think you
actually

322
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,490
yet there's an actual turning a plea
virtual machine

323
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,320
language I for her I had

324
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,919
to do transforms on on the character
glistening outlines

325
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
sector you can actually you can issue a
lot of transformation you can actually

326
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,130
make the a

327
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,740
and so there's a there's a at there's a
I'm

328
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,770
was a the

329
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,350
is the service security issue with
mister defiance net you can

330
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,929
construct you can run a font our program
a fun that

331
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,100
tries different characters a different
point sizes so you can

332
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,230
you can make text appear quickly
different like on a screen persona

333
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,169
printer

334
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:10,809
I by I dis basically changing the font
program to our

335
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,090
say who substituted letter be the letter
A

336
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,500
when you're this point size now I'm
Burda

337
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,480
who is this this reason why true type
fonts are actually programs

338
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,980
I and the the if you're to her

339
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,530
to for treatment program arguments your

340
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,690
with you your universe is basically a
the stack

341
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,240
operands a in a storage area which is

342
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,750
in the rain essentially and control
value table

343
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,159
which is also in rape basically and and
then various global backstage

344
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,429
if you a you know if you

345
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:51,880
said some kind of symmetry for drawing
or whatever

346
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,090
who will be stored in I'm

347
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,340
soon when

348
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,260
so anyways around one's so trip once the
actual

349
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,669
up on this form it's pretty simple it's
like the RSX 11

350
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,460
style is an index with assets in sizes

351
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,760
and then that's it basically so it's

352
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,900
the index is always the beginning in
anything else can be anything anywhere

353
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,500
you want to file

354
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,240
this dunno assets there soon looking
international I'll

355
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,360
a the the first 16 bytes

356
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,789
are what first for my said the magic
number and and then the

357
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,080
which is %uh which are which there are
actually several

358
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,620
on so Windows and Mac

359
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,320
kind its is nobody nobody actually

360
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,380
everyone's me consent standards not
following houses

361
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,140
cell you know guys then

362
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,929
the next the word I mean to nextel 16
bytes

363
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:56,630
6 bets is a the numbers table c16

364
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,679
is ions which is if you don't really
care about its

365
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,520
so trip 13 like designed to you a

366
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,710
the so that you could use them on my
Gaia

367
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,169
a he I S computer with a mic 120

368
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,630
memory I and running from floppy disk

369
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,370
a so there's there's a thing there's
nothing here for you for doing binary

370
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,130
tree searches on it bed if if you have
more than like

371
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,250
a couple have kilobytes of memory you
from doing that

372
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,559
don't know if anyone actually uses that
anymore but anyways

373
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,140
the the the part that

374
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,530
this interesting I guess on

375
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,610
its 16 these the 16 these species

376
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,429
with magic value for each the tables
this case it's its

377
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:48,610
shifted over by forbid imagine mentioned

378
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,320
wrapped around it if it helps you think
about it

379
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,659
and and the the actual values a free
3342 like this

380
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:59,850
smoothie bed it didn't happen dig that

381
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,440
table its the checks on which is
basically over by them together

382
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm nothing fancy is literally just or
the somewhat by

383
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,909
a than any of that we find good in
violin and I wanted

384
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,630
to the next one

385
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,650
the United application it set for itself

386
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,799
and so forth to have for example the
phone program

387
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,390
a misbehaved starts

388
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,440
actually click on the slide so

389
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,049
tonight on the two hundred and

390
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,150
206 plans 12

391
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,340
fights in which is very there and

392
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,460
since before inference for program is
actually the actual

393
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,570
32 per Commission opcodes and

394
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,960
the frequency for Jimmy chocolate is
only one bite I

395
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,100
and and then something missing the push

396
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,279
ones have from ones

397
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,679
7 a bites have operand

398
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,760
tunes UK since its to push

399
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,130
the present stack in-person this fact

400
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,429
on the stack and what wasn't again there
on

401
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,720
and then you know which is there
something about the stack

402
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,220
so so the stack is like the more the
product reviews to you

403
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,630
you know has nothing to prevent I had to
lose together

404
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,250
and then it %uh sticks and 612 don't
have that

405
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,299
an ad moved to it and I have you really
wanna does this

406
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,470
actually on this misprint actually
executed

407
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,500
at but the X but I don't have new Indian
whites here

408
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,700
a tell you the truth but I'm in any case
it's

409
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,200
its this how you that's how you really

410
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,919
so the other we things and moment you
actually look at this point man

411
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,850
stump I you'll immediately notice is
giant block have

412
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,940
unit code in the middle a with which is
the means people which is where the

413
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,900
copper information is usually kept

414
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,340
for this be refunded it says that

415
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,400
the Miss pointed sticks to regular
copyright 2003 Showtime

416
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
nobody knows nobody knows why it says
this

417
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,990
there's no actual real font listening
and

418
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,900
I know if you have any any theories let
me know not sit with them

419
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,049
don't think that the snow is like
accurate actually looked up so dex is

420
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:27,580
that like a television show

421
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,679
which have have never seen regimen which
happened and how many

422
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,539
the surgeon actually begin broadcasting
a 2006

423
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:38,240
I and so I I don't want since 2003 thats

424
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,890
that set seem like an anachronism

425
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,240
and oh no I don't know if this he was a
strategic

426
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,260
just confuse people are white in any
case

427
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,820
on the bunch that stuff from this this
font actually

428
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,900
so over whether I i'm I'm using the the
actual

429
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,049
a explain for the want example been
going through so far

430
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:07,940
so on using YouTube everyone knew about
it you

431
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,150
you're probably have to do with their
bid overnight funds which are basically

432
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,190
must have the stuff to treat a fun
compressed with his

433
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,900
this up for a3 compression scheme which
for some reason the

434
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,130
preview 3c consortium

435
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,850
a decided to make part of the standard
and stuff its

436
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,340
there's no actual this and we need to
lose except I think tapas

437
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,000
remand you think it is a several years
ago really

438
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,960
home the utility to be heard back and
forth

439
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,210
arm the it doesn't this form bonds so

440
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,000
you have to put up you have to go in and
I'm fix it and

441
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,150
and have to be more like a lovesick fool
respect that and documented but

442
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,360
but he actually it actually works have a
community where to get

443
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,970
its is is actually very very useful for
like

444
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,279
on extract indeed have embedded OpenType
fonts

445
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:03,919
anyway I'm cell

446
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,700
because my breath hmm

447
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,779
not not speaking to quickly I'm okay

448
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,850
cell was when his friend like pace
myself because I

449
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,610
in Owen people E here like in the season

450
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,940
first lines so

451
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,380
for this is coming 00 dimensions yeah
it's a cool bike

452
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,649
I'm its a

453
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:39,659
well it sits in the farming engine in
the crime

454
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,690
and since in the current a

455
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,890
at it anything that that uses font on
Windows

456
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,590
is vulnerable so Internet Explorer
office

457
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,610
on it was an actual from Firefox have
their own engines they're not

458
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,630
but becomes all Microsoft stuff know
uses

459
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,149
youth the standard Microsoft GI stuff

460
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:04,429
and permits you if you get this phone

461
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,789
in like a web page or an office
documents

462
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,830
or whatever I at the it will work

463
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,360
and I'll even work at you work even if
you if you're out running

464
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,059
I like office in the sandbox is it the
expert doesn't happen in office it

465
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:22,360
happens in the current

466
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,429
I and I'll see you after you think any
privilege exclusion because you're ready

467
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,169
0 cell the the answer bob was

468
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:35,520
so the on resumes with that one of the
things with which we had fun says

469
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,730
is I the awesome the sides outlines

470
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,970
it also has been clips and I'm

471
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,260
you can a so it

472
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,419
there's a i there's an appear this
impressive numbers for like

473
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,669
Dixon well set for according to at least
get there so if you take like these

474
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:54,779
tunes

475
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:58,200
I you must come together like that these
these the

476
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,350
area is this a verbal that

477
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,059
did tells you with that number did that
gives you what that distance between

478
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:06,279
ocean be

479
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,390
I it also works for vertical vertically
written

480
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,820
languages as well that is both an XY
offset

481
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,860
so the bird was on the on the Y offset

482
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,179
the a the basically

483
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,940
there was a the on so when you when you
do that

484
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,120
whoops so we do this didn't actually
check

485
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,659
good-by absent wasn't we passed in the
buffer

486
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:35,799
and I'm as a you busy right now a bitmap

487
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,000
on top of something else in the kernel

488
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,220
would be the worst since it's a the
bitmap bridging operation

489
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,260
you can write and its you can move them
so you can set this to want you can sit

490
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,779
0 on so the the the question is like
what how

491
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:54,350
was what will be the best day it's in
the Colonels overwrite

492
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,289
with one's I in order to have to make an
exploit so

493
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:01,450
here's the answer will I mean he's the
ex white matter

494
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,570
so on is the actual I

495
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,799
copy you busy control that number and
that number

496
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,919
and at and the busy work together so you
can

497
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,700
you can add its did you happen

498
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,549
and if you hear is the passion see that
that this is what has changed is the

499
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,059
actual

500
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:26,059
the actual bombing I basically just
existing

501
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:29,990
numbers movement both players in
together and then uses that as the of

502
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,429
them without you checking it's not past

503
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,440
De Anza you the first buffered I

504
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,600
needs to go in for the the expletives

505
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,890
with that 2,624

506
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,190
bytes past the beginning the first
matter

507
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,559
I'm things right whose work you think
enough

508
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,559
in files if you're if you're reading
signatures something in seconds you

509
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,190
wanna check

510
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,750
they had a this this value isn't like
really big

511
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,700
on that basically the ticket number
multiplied by three to you in advance

512
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,440
your offset missed this is the bitmap
tickets with its members

513
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,399
its the 1 pixel x1 pixel bitmap and I'm

514
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,429
with with only the hybrid sent I

515
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,590
so

516
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,899
a so it's is reading one bit and memory

517
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:26,100
I think the slide it says that okay yeah

518
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,279
reminder that's that's what it's doing

519
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,480
I and so the this may actually six
countries finds font

520
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,320
a all the 2i meanwhile activities two
characters

521
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,460
these for Charizard is novels

522
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,779
and and retrieve the ball into the it
has been you have new lease to you

523
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,200
because it might reasonably

524
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,190
if the crime the two together for so for
this P clear

525
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,799
exploit the the two characters were area
the Coleman

526
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,960
and AI clues print to see

527
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,070
an average we expect you had put them
together

528
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:05,100
exactly that or like like this see

529
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,649
never there was the trigger for the
explain

530
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:12,399
for the food because you dissolve the
rounds

531
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,720
on on those actually years of yours on

532
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,740
curious about the stuff is non-zero is
why

533
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,279
by its what's in there from

534
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,730
and Nevis like Twitter from here
versions something

535
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,100
the zoom the other were characters
anyway so

536
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:36,100
whose you have have to explain actually
works

537
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,740
and I didn't think to be yes I but yes
and so

538
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,019
how to do this on mmm

539
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,679
sue right I'm to

540
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,470
on and so basically you see this there's
only one with this getting and

541
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,549
memory by this by this explain on

542
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:01,429
and as it turns out what would happen

543
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,750
these will the place with that

544
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,760
rather it is a the the prisoners explain

545
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,309
the bit if they decide the the choose to

546
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:15,100
to add wins to the linked to the CVT
rain

547
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,980
arm because as

548
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,789
a so it's a bit early was is at 128
attitude one which is the reason why you

549
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:24,260
said

550
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,090
now believes is 129 injuries and see the
hearing

551
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,980
night there was only actually one
actually do that are looking there is is

552
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,390
looks

553
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,320
work happened is

554
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,460
it just so happened to be the this to
people

555
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,919
happen to live immediately like four
bytes prior

556
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,340
to the BB im steaming so a

557
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,000
who is this is reminder so we we'd only
memories with the actual original

558
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,149
didn't have was it skipped all that and
it would there

559
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:58,039
so a where they didn't put it there

560
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,970
would be here and that like me to think
that this

561
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,450
was actually this morning a at and

562
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:11,179
a with this did was was a & Sons Inc com
with GV

563
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:15,679
who VST accessible from within the game
itself

564
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,730
has been a remake the global state
through that

565
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,270
to the CPT right so at the end
harassment

566
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,310
the expiry -ism written in the two type
virtual machine language

567
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,450
so all the other things is this actually
with the

568
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,599
so when the if you're if you do explains
the defensively some stuff in a global

569
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,040
I the insti- like for example function
pointers because

570
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,099
on if you from the this is from the
documentation

571
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,280
a Apple's website if you look at a bunch
of the

572
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,040
instructions a flexing founding for
example is like

573
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,829
whatever six-a against 9 something

574
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:59,260
different honey functions you can like
you can either like round

575
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,150
up and I'm you run down to zero or round
up the next number

576
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,890
markets if it's like it halfway between
right in this direction or

577
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,950
this year and that way it's is the best
things but is

578
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,060
it's a is in CS you're sitting area
state

579
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,380
for for with the current grounding
stayed is so when you call

580
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,690
the round round instruction will go into
you

581
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,070
the actual implementation for which
whichever would have the christine is

582
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,070
and so in the a soon in the moon is
colonel the

583
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,619
the actual with is implemented is with
much a function for is a

584
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,160
basically just on as we have

585
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,400
have functions a for each the

586
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,119
implementations feature these and be
sleeping on the status change a function

587
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:43,720
pointer to

588
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,910
which one is the current when will you
do you call around

589
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,070
a the the one that was actually used in
the expert was

590
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,579
this this instruction here a

591
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,859
single with and that also functions
minor

592
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:01,000
a at so backing up to date

593
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,190
so the as an economic November like

594
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,570
I got the sex we got my lap and like

595
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,630
is like Julia figure with things doing

596
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,619
gonna be detected actually here is
must've wanna do is

597
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,670
is and some question he do we detect
this so

598
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,890
I if your gonna protectiveness Anna on
says

599
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,609
I had the a and the I'm map

600
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:28,310
version well sue

601
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,380
I will so the nappers in in a this
year's

602
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,060
next line here with with what actually
was

603
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,089
bring it over the cliff program because
the slide is right here now

604
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:43,140
I driven so basically the

605
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,339
a so good with was a replaced with a

606
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:50,290
call back to the current locations
though

607
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:55,579
on I reason infinite loop other calling
itself in Feb stackin

608
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:58,900
blue screen boxing at the end stack
frame a

609
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,000
and so if you just you serve your said
we'd is too damn

610
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,010
a dump your kernel I'm gonna crash is

611
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,810
on you can put back into Katie in become
the burger and

612
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,329
on see he went broke where and so

613
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:19,990
arm the delay so when you do this the
last thing was executing

614
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,599
and going to the to stack frame was just
execute with program

615
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,589
into the program fixed vikes this other

616
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:32,570
to take fun program on executed so it's
a

617
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,720
mmm hundredth down in

618
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,730
and it's basically a you more this kind
of stuff

619
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,040
and so you when you bring the thing in

620
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,040
to key the

621
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,200
you that's the

622
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,030
firms United it tells you which is that
this is the stack

623
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,420
done and so is next week with program

624
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,450
and I'm and when you look at

625
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,579
the this is the industry's make me dying

626
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,910
I finished and v

627
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,920
this was the the shellcode here which is
since we

628
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,550
jumping back to itself continuously if
you look at the

629
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,950
the stack pointer you see it hit the
Indian that page

630
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,270
memory and and so forth but there's no
chance to

631
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,550
for sewer

632
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,599
I'm to neither so when we I've

633
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,640
and nephew only do through this if you
have

634
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,900
not spent a lifetime doing currently
packing I

635
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,060
bad these the I'm arguments

636
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,589
to the city's functions this night is
simple

637
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:44,730
one actually paid on

638
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,410
to which these if you go we can remember
it's reform program

639
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,550
and the

640
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,900
which is which is the stuff that was
executing

641
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,109
so really if you crashed into display
from

642
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:03,190
so this is another argument here the
second one

643
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,010
its a the penny pointing to the that
other random programming

644
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,250
at the beginning font set with member
never the beginning I think newspapers

645
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,880
that

646
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,859
yet 325 my hand so there was news that
other one

647
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:24,849
a few heard no sir is you but does this
work is doing

648
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:29,940
hand and selling the

649
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,740
its its this law would go back and
witnesses basically states there who's

650
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,420
there

651
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,609
and the there's been two flags

652
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,510
be which are which occur after that

653
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,960
after the program and energy used for
anything this big

654
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,750
explaining so I don't actually know why
they were were when they were set to

655
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,109
this

656
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:52,230
are you have 3137

657
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,589
next that small because it's

658
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:59,240
it doesn't make any sense enter pleas
flags

659
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,700
pitted but it does make sense is is like
313

660
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,339
7 either because because that have to be
there around

661
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,880
and I'm

662
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,020
have humanism yeses me now

663
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,390
on the on

664
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:24,380
as a going back to the crashed a the
last thing that was a

665
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,589
to last instruction that was actually
executed rather

666
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:30,880
please we're gonna return to you even in
craft

667
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,599
was the inspection ever actually reach
this instruction say

668
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,869
and might be super Mare & batteries

669
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:42,230
on so view that laser pointer

670
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,069
70 the sees these mixed in

671
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:49,950
now so the somewhere down this

672
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,660
this spring

673
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,690
somewhere down down that function I
leads to a crash rather

674
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,000
release the sheltered execution which
which I

675
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,190
this is this the snapshot statement
happens

676
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,900
soon the well that's just what I said

677
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,970
just a second ago and

678
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,000
I do actually have the soon only like
these presenter slides we see the next

679
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,589
flight is

680
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:21,079
to for you don't repeat yourself but I
and i said im

681
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,550
is your display so

682
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,890
that if a standard be repeating myself
sorry about that

683
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,480
the so he was third argument who is this
mysterious

684
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,490
a thing here

685
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,260
on these Official pointers there on that

686
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,079
capsicum everything and the

687
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,240
you know the index pointers a

688
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,210
I can appointing mostly new the and

689
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,260
but not all the way so you is a family

690
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,089
doing something about year so it it
wasn't these are like

691
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:03,390
reconstruction its this coming on into
the last instruction actually XQ with

692
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,150
missus W a instruction and never going
to go any further so

693
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,359
so he crashed on happen and then

694
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,730
ON stack inspect forces with stacks like

695
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,010
you can see it's is returning you will
be returned itself over again but

696
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,460
and I'm the says who

697
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,260
the thing is a sorted do you could guess
that

698
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,520
that the something to the show who diz
is probably want to register as possible

699
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,829
said

700
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:35,490
well yes I is I'm

701
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,260
vat once that of said so

702
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,420
I anyplace that yes I plus 50 hex
appears that might actually the gym to

703
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,960
swim

704
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,020
were you know yea X plus

705
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,230
family bites I'm ibn or

706
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,960
Uvex plus four that they could be

707
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,310
think if you went into the socket is his
somewhere

708
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,660
there's a jump were callin at

709
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,550
bed I the centuries into the shock and
execution so

710
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,589
I'm enemies might be sweet you put my
dad Nanda

711
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:16,339
actually what was going on so as one
would think people have neither

712
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:19,400
and I the

713
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,400
a with the prisoners actually sees all
the debug

714
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,230
if you with a good debugging symbols
this these

715
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,390
there's like this was 2 for if functions
here with her

716
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,660
exactly the same ones that are in in the
a two-time

717
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,040
documentation this one actually began

718
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,599
Apple's website and so it's

719
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,740
is basically the dissolve the

720
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,720
all the the actual and haitian 32 the
opulence and they all basically look

721
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,420
like this is why not

722
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,900
operator a it doesn't stuff magazine
this way or that way

723
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,420
and its and then use like the neg
negative

724
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,609
negation operator missus not people on
Twitter and so forth

725
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:06,069
they'll be if you like this and you
looking for me it's pretty clear that

726
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:06,640
this

727
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,480
this branch is taken when there's an
error and that branch just a few minutes

728
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,960
niner

729
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,400
since you can figure out that moved like
you figure out

730
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
you well okay that's going to be the
area code

731
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,089
that's me where the worst word I these
are the

732
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:24,089
inputs this is where the the operands
and so forth

733
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:27,930
are pulled from and so forth in a

734
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,540
et cetera and his priestly for the
through its paces in the gym

735
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,150
this big some people in the a a

736
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,460
in in the duke it out since I that
basically take that back knife that

737
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,200
killed more than before

738
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,700
doodle jump triple jump that X and
executed work on that

739
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,770
never 70 the

740
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,819
that's the first thing rooney's from his
dads is it

741
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:55,980
I'm makes a copy of that I and

742
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,040
your ex and I mean we call them so and
the reason

743
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,640
i dont nada its cuz im much really

744
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,290
useful things the for for you're just
saying

745
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,880
hey like would what functions actually
liked

746
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,960
do this no tightly touch this particular

747
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,210
memory address you know I'm the so

748
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,349
it's pretty pretty soon the river this
is my Google VM stick

749
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:25,630
and at these ones here well those are
all

750
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:31,000
Americans with it's the Crimson discount
looking at you can't logically

751
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,200
figure out what with all the stuff does
even without debugging symbols

752
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,180
I P because numerous threatened on

753
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,950
certain variables are only used by like
I'm

754
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,200
with instructions for example a or

755
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,700
this means only used by relative jumps

756
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:54,619
a and so forth so

757
00:45:54,619 --> 00:46:01,170
on and

758
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,890
now in and this was only for conditional
et cetera

759
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:09,150
okay and then and so forth is also
actually this is even cynical

760
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,030
sheehan's I was no quibbles yes but its
is for

761
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,040
probably thief but well there is a
Google GS

762
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,500
name dysfunction but but a it's not
actually where else

763
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,220
so it's probably safe to assume it
probably is actually such a thing was

764
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,560
just

765
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,740
has just been stripped from the a from
the amnesty and

766
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,310
currently backing symbols me

767
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,900
sent use when was it I'm doing this for
a couple hours and

768
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,400
the figure it all out and then so

769
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,330
services firms where we left off so
crash somewhere down that path

770
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,930
and a missus the

771
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,470
the next execution

772
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:55,410
I believe I'm yet so someone years ago
hundreds on the constitutional guarantee

773
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:59,310
and then the actual mean okay so
basically

774
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,540
the actual them

775
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:08,160
me was that that's the actual

776
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,480
John for the jump table for each the
opulence I'm

777
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,660
like that its its by value

778
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,950
good times for good do that for down
call that

779
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,530
Sony way if you all the stuff you should

780
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,610
you make its it's mostly something
harnesses current EDS

781
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,340
iight of people that I've reverse
engineering is

782
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,870
is not actually oh no I'm almost done

783
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:38,710
hang on are getting on me only under the
last master mccracken early running at a

784
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,140
time

785
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,470
cell cell I'm

786
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,060
arm so you know what this actually so

787
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,260
arm skipping and I'll get a good part so

788
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,140
SES action structures the interpreter
the basis the interpreter staggs

789
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,320
storage area rain isn't reliable which
on

790
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,030
as the camera pixels point size when it
when it crashed the kernel is amusing

791
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,710
for point

792
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,730
point size thats the CVT County which is

793
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,320
129 now your sister did have one of is
one and some other stuff

794
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,700
and so the the important part is is
right there

795
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,410
a is out there was with the at there was
with the

796
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,230
was written and I'm idea

797
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,800
by the bitmap and so

798
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,800
so this through the CVC table you notice
it

799
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,860
it's like really what grade four bytes
have

800
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,930
this and so a

801
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,090
in and so now know this now this small
structures now it's in CBT

802
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,210
so be in I've leading you on

803
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,540
people who weren't mean you know is on

804
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,350
this billion my here's the on flip

805
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:53,160
bull units is is a this is for members
got flip on a form of

806
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,410
if you look at me bc it's a 21 yr 0 have
to cross that

807
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,630
the structure and and you go and you
look at the pawn

808
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,620
were far often see what they do in the
dark conditions like over the surface

809
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,570
billion of

810
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:07,400
anyway so bits with us as an ox

811
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,400
and a and so it on is also this

812
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,470
this point of the show occurred I which
is that which

813
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:17,270
I is is basically calls itself thing and

814
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,350
this particular sample and seven a

815
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:25,320
the soon as you can see the funny thing
is this the name is different

816
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,990
given the symbols this is missus to view
the documentation will host a viewing

817
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,330
in the actual tibetans kernel symbols
anyway so

818
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,470
arm in which is actually I this action

819
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,620
the invitation for that instruction
which members last music

820
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,280
last %ah produced executed the

821
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,360
you do look down the middle here rated

822
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,800
it is clear

823
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,060
on the seagram's a grams a function
pointer that

824
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,000
are that structure and then Jon Stewart
a

825
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,020
that one so a

826
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,250
newspaper is a ago you is not currently
pointing to the children beginning their

827
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,510
a is a reminder so with the way it is
with this works is a

828
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,670
it you putting stuff in there the it

829
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,850
the keys to the basic it's a looping in
an icky strike at the a

830
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,960
iterator in with the story steve was the
first injury on

831
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,210
the then flips the football on bit of

832
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,520
so the right now on member and then a

833
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,210
down down here for the back on and me in
between these instructions basically go

834
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,570
and read the you'll see this this kind
have these parable

835
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,760
like that I if you can read a

836
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,590
your place like by two million you read
from it and so forth

837
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:48,320
snow I'm

838
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,520
goes arista for CBT value which

839
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,070
in this case was your because that was
resigns on

840
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:58,370
bitches there and then a

841
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,880
if we're to the attack and then checks
to see if you change the res the same to

842
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,680
you again

843
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,470
subtracts them and I if it changed in it

844
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,560
john served as other branch here but id

845
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,800
duties this time and so it he goes into
loops this is how you do

846
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,080
in true type assembly

847
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,010
and then is actually executed its

848
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,820
this action undocumented thing actually
did like going reverse the

849
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,990
function figure out its so the G one
thing is this was

850
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:34,370
jump on its if it's true for its greater
than 0 or 430 but it's not too fine for

851
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,060
negative but

852
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,680
this case is negative and so I actually
like that I think it actually

853
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,390
dozen disconcerted faulting false
actually thinkin

854
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,780
to me this is so funny but he runs
actress should be on

855
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,400
at whoever wrote this I mixed up the
deaths more annexes movers you

856
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,450
representation have 528

857
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,640
versus he either should XP hacks not
fifty hex

858
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,040
a I know it doesn't affect the XP cousin

859
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,420
the that it done

860
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,550
basically works within the first twenty
five a

861
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:14,860
iterations anyway so the

862
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,920
so busy three things been home in of and
eventually

863
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,450
I have to use much magda I'm

864
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,080
37 times I you use like you find

865
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,320
and so you know where you are you now
know where your instructor

866
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,740
so on yetta make some copies as media

867
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,910
it goes in a business meeting is
basically reading a

868
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,840
reading about to the function pointers
out a the the 1i here

869
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,190
%uh the first one is is the okay homes
to almost there

870
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,780
is OK so the

871
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,820
so it doesn't stop and has more stuff
and then a

872
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,980
in-service fleet is busy taking that
number

873
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,380
I love the Ray adding few which points
to with visual fun working with the font

874
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,660
the show who dis is about time he bites
past the

875
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,790
the beginning at the soda and basic get
that pointer

876
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:07,530
ads 82 made and then operated back on
top of the function pointer to the

877
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,440
SSW search in the cause is not for you
and I jumped in the car

878
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:18,440
to okay here

879
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,720
that okay

880
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,140
I'm

881
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,769
and the Nexus move published up on this
too Google

882
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:37,549
a and then also I'm I found a after with
this that with people and also

883
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:41,039
actually written up something in them
and UNEP any questions

884
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:46,880
arm

885
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,160
me think I am I think it's only one

886
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,249
as video a readers to see your cans at

887
00:53:54,249 --> 00:53:57,579
with her earlier drafts this but it's I
should actually I'm

888
00:53:57,579 --> 00:54:00,269
matching funding right this isn't my
peepers I think it as you work a lot

889
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,039
better as I

890
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:04,390
piece of paper you could stare at for a
long time yes

891
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:08,549
I

892
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:12,869
possibly its is not not that interesting
but I could probably

893
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:16,069
I after to go where you left it as a
medium summer

894
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:20,569
but I I could probably do that I'm I
didn't hear a lot of stuff and

895
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:23,749
so the question is if I'd see if I could
sure the energy I defied

896
00:54:23,749 --> 00:54:27,150
file but I it's not very irritated
better

897
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:31,220
I mean I can I can see when but what it
is arm

898
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,289
the other questions it was the first
lines were available anyplace and I'm

899
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:38,609
actually think they are action I think
an sec

900
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:42,579
the versioning was a give you can second
lever action is action the consequence

901
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:46,119
website so yes the slides are actually
online summer

902
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:53,119
question up some

903
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,029
the yes actually so the question is

904
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,910
I your summer movies with a image files

905
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,680
in Windows and a actually historically
you can actually give several

906
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,890
real examples a because why mean that
there is a

907
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,200
with his military things got a special
case but like the icon

908
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,200
file a 15 years ago and then there is a
member there's a quantifying

909
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,609
gif and Mike widget for whatever se
pague a

910
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:26,589
ones from like seven years ago wasn't
bad so cuz

911
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,989
because the I yeah anyway I think
actually

912
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:34,079
bunches record and user space though
other the

913
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,230
the animated cursor when I think was
actually in the kernel

914
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:41,619
right you the questions

915
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:47,599
don't see neither

916
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,599
your hands so okay I think that art here
