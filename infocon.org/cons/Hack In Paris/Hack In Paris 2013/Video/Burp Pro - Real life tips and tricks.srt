1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,500
I felt before might ok just a quick
Annan's

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,840
I we found the can iraq so if you think
it shows you just need to us to the

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,349
organization and of course who is ask
for proof like a

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,690
which would always inside or something
like that when it's just you been

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,750
I'm cell

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,150
the dark I'm I we talk about a third of
it which is a Winona

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,510
proxy use for offensive purposes
ancestor

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,780
why I am I have a security company which
is very smart I'm using only one

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,670
employee

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,670
a I'm doing a lot of

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,719
yes I'm the bus an I'm doing a lot of
the

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,340
Pettersen testing month must clear 82
web a case on Web Services Web data

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,789
and Tom I am NOT if you exceed

14
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,030
at or we spotted but we go as the guy

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,969
I'll as a company but they love a
separates

16
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,260
I'll use a box with four years and was
up boxes before I am doing this kind of

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,210
stuff for

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,340
something like an F-fourteen yells
already

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,500
an I have a few warnings professes not
to talk about

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,880
the methodologies so I would not
displaying

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
go to do the Recon size hands and
looking for the Suns at

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,799
I love some very nice books on the
subject

23
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,930
I love the chapter 21 observe the web
application to go on a book

24
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,780
everybody should I read it at least ten
times

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,750
and it's not add up 11 so if you have no
clue about what

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,930
at the suites is a I'm sorry for you but
to

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,960
you we not Anna for the

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,090
get the values the stock and

29
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,130
a.m. finally everything was tasty

30
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,810
on the show and 1.5 that 11 which is not
too late

31
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,320
latest one because the UAE's 1 just last
week

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,049
and that it should work perfectly fine
unser latest version here

33
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,450
um 02 compare

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,150
to was a producer a in fact I don't care

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,790
I bebe free is to late

36
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,980
are eighty to be a pro and moms out
these open source it's from the West

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,610
project

38
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,610
arm there's too many functional beds for
me to use it

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,349
in a prevention are engagements so I we
stick to be a pro which is made to have

40
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:30,830
choice

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,250
and where II invested

42
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,560
me my training and everything so

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,950
sorry but there is no capabilities and
web service here is that the Xterra

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,160
and I just you need to know is that
everything which is I did

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,310
to was up and which is not to be in
Belpre OH we know if you guys doing some

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,090
lobbying the and up for arms

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,390
and we usually get the features weeks or
months later

48
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,970
so I have no good reason to switch and
two or something else

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,070
so that's the point that we will cause a

50
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,410
I have something like 10 votes 100 slide
and so I will probably be

51
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,560
early a quick I mean fast

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,370
so that I V that that he's read Asian

53
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,080
we will I have lot of different formats
during

54
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,190
a engagements depending on the
underlying technologies face important

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,090
and you have a lot of formats supported
by Dee Ford

56
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,220
and the sum was that she worked she
partied way I extensions

57
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,040
ours is very basic uses as a classic

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,100
a but idk week with you have some I get
parameters

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,260
is do you have some both parameters and
you have some cookies

60
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,520
so pizza is a keezer GPC seeing like in
PHP

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,170
get was complete and this is not very

62
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,920
reborn and if you want to switch
something from

63
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,790
worst to cookie for example you we need
to take care of

64
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,950
I'm kidding and if you switch to get you
out who I am quitting to a price that

65
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,150
iraq so

66
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,830
you just switch to the a run stop and
everything

67
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,450
it's much more readable or and if you
click on cookie

68
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,820
you whether it's my book that and you
can switch to get for example

69
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,310
and see between for some to get
parameter with the preparing putting an

70
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,310
everything so it's very easy

71
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,130
and it's very easy and so to remove
sitting right there on the tails

72
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,330
without looking for is a the semi-colon

73
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,720
as a Jew in miss so it's very pretty
poor

74
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,470
anti-seize XML so I do a lot of X in
their 80s Steph as you may know

75
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,910
and eyes this is you need a burr and you
have this

76
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,169
that that which will do some the area

77
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,700
basic presentation like it an

78
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,110
aviation and everything a

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,410
M if he sees the action

80
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,950
messaging format though I think to see
their 82 fresh applications

81
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,260
and you keV as some bite on a scripps

82
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,090
doing that too okay

83
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,150
for issue could ash said on your fart
the

84
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,530
it will be called and Paso AMF is a

85
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,310
mix between a binary at data and as a PR
extreme

86
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,040
so its somewhat read a boy but you have
no clue about whether it's what he's

87
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,300
it's being it said object description

88
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,230
and you love the a.m. est that which we
do something that we nice

89
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,910
an you love so is this is a very

90
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,460
simple example arbitrage if you have
complex object you have

91
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,180
arts the details to object and this is
very easy to read

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,180
as you state if you are in Windows
technologies

93
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,060
okay businesses this is a real life

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,210
as you state at so it's that's huge

95
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,460
and this is a

96
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,420
still use but its more readable or love
some

97
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,750
detail into a kinda value and you have
to some binary

98
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,570
here and there but at it's better okay
so

99
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,070
thats by default and of course you if
you have some specific needs

100
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,880
for example you have a protocol which to
which was designed for the specific

101
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,210
application

102
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,500
it's impossible to find as a format
support either by built so you can do

103
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,330
that by ya

104
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,560
extensions and it's very simple I mean

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,240
a why I which are you making so if US a

106
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,440
Jason that that's so this is from the to
a tweet RPI

107
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,940
week which was just sat down 10 10 days
ago

108
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,670
and a.m. so you have some Jason that

109
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,670
and you you just need to to use the
extension and it's a

110
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,780
very read more and here

111
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,120
its and soft even as you can see

112
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,720
and so that's a kind of each year you
can is indiana

113
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,310
activate on note do you want to eat to
be sorted because

114
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,100
you easier to read or do you want to be
you insulted because

115
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,530
it's what is use basic education so
that's very easy to do

116
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,670
and we I'm

117
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,610
as you can see the season only line of
the world extension

118
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,800
which is greatI to its functionality
everything as

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,860
he's chretien and Bhutan's or

120
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,880
binding action to batons and everything
so you just need a time

121
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,050
dates that you can reuse and you have
just

122
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,340
if you are doing to by 10 and extension
you just

123
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,680
have is the slime and everything which
is supported

124
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,980
by default in bite on it's just 19

125
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,050
12 you own extension supporting this
format so it's very

126
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,010
interesting and so he shoves his kind of
need

127
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,070
just I use as the six inch and as a
template and just modified

128
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,090
so few lines or 82 fortunate I

129
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,240
we have more and more from a script
everybody is y to a free skate

130
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,290
to a strict code just two make s are
does their job of looking for the Nexus

131
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,220
S I think so

132
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,810
and the so it is a you need a more

133
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,810
an we have the two extensions a dealing
with JavaScript

134
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,840
above them by using cut from a riser
when Nana

135
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,330
good GS with you for your butt Aug um

136
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,210
that the first one is using Java to call
reno

137
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,090
to call a javascript you know they're
tomb court judge of that P

138
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,820
API and isolates not very and i cant

139
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,190
and just 11 is Python extension which
week or two

140
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,500
bite and ivory so it's a very very clean

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,310
and that's the kind of

142
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,610
output we get so it's so

143
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,560
just the the formation and

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,320
that's the repercussion so a if you are
spending your four days

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,300
in this kind of stuff you clearly we're
I am

146
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,140
be more predictive in the long run

147
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,810
if you sees this kind of content and you
don't need to think too much to

148
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,100
looking to wear we use is

149
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,590
labor start and stop and everything it's
very easy ACA

150
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,650
I'll s1 disease but about us which is a
go put a collar

151
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:34,100
each using a lot of their applications

152
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,590
I am like Google Talk a sink and ounces
extension

153
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,930
I'll 02 decode if we put the left

lot of the british ennui that's a lot of

166
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,130
heat on everything and you spend your
day inside that

167
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,320
and so a Citrix acecomm thanks to a bit
ons

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,750
you have every everywhere in the
application you have two kinds of Bhutan

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,080
you he's won is one is the documentation
on this one

170
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,590
is restore default and yeah context
you're so

171
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,720
if you click if you will %uh uneasy
documentation or 82

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,110
temporary file location: and issue kik
here you read only reset

173
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,570
to was a default value information

174
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,110
action of disease bot so it's very
useful because

175
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,920
issue upset that a lot of completely
teachings

176
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,130
and everywhere in bed up for doing that
we competitive a

177
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,050
for resourcing the week complex
application for example and then you

178
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,950
need to go back to the default value for

179
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,060
one location just keep 1 Bhutan annual
sure

180
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,770
you will not miss all your Mac was
settings all

181
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,199
whatever you are actually in elsewhere
and

182
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,079
and sometimes if forced to have no
default value of

183
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,709
unease a at Bhutan and issue I've never

184
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,000
Press this boot on you should try and
reads a

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,019
what went on to a few times because I
uses

186
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,230
lot of stuff is that the ended up the
Commission and you should ready

187
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,279
and I'm really teach you Bay Julie sense
i mean you

188
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,970
you you some money use sometime out so
to to be really efficient I am

189
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,930
achieve so I mainly a common line guy so
was a mouse his arm

190
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,639
mainly a way of losing time and I'm

191
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,470
you have by default at not you up a.m.

192
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,160
ninety actions which are defined and is
that can be activated by shock it

193
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,730
by default you have perhaps for Chia

194
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,060
up these accents which are configured an

195
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,269
so we we had a a quick above you are you
have everything ready to cook the past

196
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,470
and get so

197
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,110
on nor no mystery and you can do some

198
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,480
a encoding and decoding for you I

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,279
ace H GM and and may 54

200
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,690
straight for you keep books which is
very efficient between

201
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,709
stuff to put that we said he could do
for you it's a very

202
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,290
it we not I i mean not impacts
walkthrough

203
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,690
even not modify in place so it's very
very

204
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,010
went down and mmm we need to get so you
can switch from

205
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,380
back to top using shift and

206
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,199
and my personal favorite is a issue
repeat their request so it's not defined

207
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,060
by default

208
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,269
from but if you are in repeater

209
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,420
you arm typing to keyboard in order to
sing to what we do

210
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,829
and then you need to take some mouse go
to go put on

211
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,250
and go back to your text field tools and
next week with

212
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,540
its very inefficient and so

213
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,459
you defines the sack structured and you
can keep

214
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,829
I you focus on the text books and
comfort she

215
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:35,339
every time you need to test as the
specific request so he sees

216
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,390
very very a use for at least in my
opinion

217
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,630
back

218
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,709
all end up four runs

219
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:51,209
on is a offender questions like we need
we need that was the score

220
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,779
inbox the story every

221
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,880
but ET's already there in fact by
default

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,959
Tom your every week with is ideal at the
bottom

223
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,209
ulcer proxy story because its new were
so you out notice call you need to

224
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,730
use your mouse on everything and but if
you

225
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,649
simply click if you will as the same
information but

226
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,560
in a reverse order so every you request
we put up

227
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,209
to the top up the history and then you
ever to score

228
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,939
and it's really easy so I have no deal
for that

229
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:30,230
but as soon as some traffic go through
the proxy

230
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,889
you see is a line changing and you have
exactly what she's

231
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:39,510
I needed for which is quite so it's very
and very easy and very stupid but

232
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,160
it works so that's on the Sony sing and
I i asked to

233
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,839
tomatoes um custom peanuts

234
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,579
sold by you for just some be like sweets
which are shipped

235
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,920
with a the Pooh you have some tea for
two so I chance default username

236
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,370
differed by Swan everything

237
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,959
and but sometimes you want to use some
poser least

238
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,079
and you can do Lord and go to an
external

239
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,949
file and important stuff I but each its
something like

240
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,170
free of almost kicks seats way too much

241
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,389
a so you just need to configure from the
into your

242
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,420
in to Joe menu you

243
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,310
go to each directory where you put you
want least and you include

244
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,529
as M or and then you can Annan

245
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,730
do it he forms a inferred your a and 30
min you

246
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,870
a access to your watchlist with a knee
went leak

247
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,480
and so is my key combo always something
like that one from

248
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,269
up that Nick does and face the bees
endeavors to

249
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,459
and everything you need you can the rock
you

250
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,740
that's what least if you are in but
sourcing password and everything

251
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,279
you do whatever you want a so you you

252
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,630
you win a free clicks this is core hope
that's a nice gone so this is

253
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,990
a very few people know about as this one

254
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,380
a from if you send a request to was a
scanner

255
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,949
between automatically defined as the
point where to inject

256
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:11,510
I'm with defied value and so it's it's
well done

257
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,990
that sometimes you do not do not want to
or tonight

258
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,380
needs a automatic features or in
intelligence

259
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,860
of the tour and you just need to you
find yourself what you want but you

260
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,480
still want to use a scanner
functionality

261
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,059
which is black box sandwiches went on so

262
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:33,720
you send your request to win for them
you would be fine you'll payload

263
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,740
as usual or as you ices war and then
right-click

264
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,399
and echte activities can be seen defined
in for some point

265
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,790
and Israel users can now I G H

266
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,260
applied only two is this aspesi ch

267
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,649
a location so you up

268
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:55,140
out everything you need you have the
best that control on the location

269
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,209
and you are towards a a automatic
power-off scan now which is looking for

270
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,480
you

271
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,500
okay managing States

272
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,890
back Epps an automatic backups is use
for

273
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,880
why because if you are doing some so you
psyching

274
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,990
and you I mean I usually last notion of
time when doing this kind of stuff

275
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,280
fast so I will of course forgot to press
the Save stayed with done

276
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,880
an of course my GBM with flash

277
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,500
and I we lost a few our stuff walk an

278
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,840
so that city so in

279
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,309
ocean miscue I've does automatique make
a population

280
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:47,830
just be fine so every effect on me know
they want to and at the backup

281
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,149
I want to stir to stow in this ford also

282
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:54,480
fights our time stamp you so you have no
way to

283
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,360
a

284
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,250
all the right Christian previews that up
and of course only to see to

285
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,730
taking a back up plan is its this way a
venue very very tiring

286
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,790
and you cause you'll that by mistake you
will see

287
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,910
I've just ate a which is from

288
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,090
right to the filing that you you can
reuse it

289
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,790
later I save and restore

290
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,040
house a classic and I'm company on I was
a automatic backup feature

291
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,799
ion in fact I'm

292
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,820
you can use it to export to customers if
your customers

293
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,710
are advanced enough to have been up
themself now so it's very useful you

294
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,530
you put all your proof of concept in
repeater tops present

295
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,410
excrement then you export and then use
and the fights the customer which opened

296
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,990
in bill pandy out then

297
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,200
gives the save the state's a gift was a

298
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,799
engineers opened this does which we
loved it and weighs

299
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,570
and sends the of forbid to modify this
cup

300
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,010
so it's something like a league-wide
protection for the company on he's a

301
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,669
manager

302
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,340
age fine just got there we are and zip
it and distills are not

303
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,860
below 25 it so it's a kind it's a way to
use

304
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,610
as it's kind of frustrating looking

305
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,880
and the Cure actually some

306
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,090
saving information about extension is
big you bet

307
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:24,130
I opened it at last week so it would be
fixed and sold

308
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,340
it sees a big deal right now but concede
they are that you can

309
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:34,340
arts okay with extension option

310
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,650
0

311
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,050
are out so it's either a few shortcuts
switching from

312
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,220
get to bust so you find a XSS using gets
question

313
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,890
is it expert that by using both so you
have to solution as a you do it manually

314
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,230
annually for made

315
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,980
a something like a new line of band
20sec on sinking to

316
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,320
how to do it if not sufficient so

317
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,700
just right he could send request metered
and you have

318
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,530
is this get request and you will have
disease personal quest to everything

319
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,320
and I

320
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,490
the I bet they kill everything

321
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,110
USA content-type: and a DI you as a
continuous with the right value

322
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,540
and issue need any specific including I
mean you to switch to post to get

323
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,010
and you will eat with their so take a
loves a specific a URL including so

324
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,510
everything is perfect for you

325
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,650
and so you just need to think I want to
test

326
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:37,930
use away get to both topless to get and
you do not need to seeing two

327
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,810
how to do that use it or okay and I you
want to earn some

328
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,620
next on our list of party to its which
do not super of a

329
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,720
mmm do not support a proxying

330
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,040
all you are using thick like don't which
is not super

331
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,060
proxying and of course you see what
you've been up

332
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,120
and so you the final Eastern which

333
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,570
I i've these option an object which is
cheaper

334
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,100
in the perplexing and Zen you

335
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,100
is ritual to uses keep fish which does
not support

336
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,280
proxy and you stand your list the No

337
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,090
and then the least now we take care of
the wild things are content

338
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,220
to the react I get and you have
everything to know we debated to which

339
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,500
she's as taught by Bill up and easy to

340
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,700
sucks is he too thought is it everything
so it's very

341
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,640
easy and the same sinful or 6i on for
example the

342
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,060
issue 12 do something deception because

343
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,020
you have a complex workflow and you want
to modify if you request

344
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,260
as this is the way to to do it

345
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,020
invisible boxing and walking in bout
okay

346
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,330
a so you're doing good internists you
have to write the report

347
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,350
arm than you need to things

348
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,690
get some data out of bed up to your
report

349
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,230
I so you need to export serve you well
so you have

350
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,380
from city which is cool Puri but it's
very basic

351
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,539
it works on the Wii get with Qwest and
wheeze get there when it does

352
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:16,010
so no cookies nope was woody nope was
but he knows basically he does nothing

353
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,510
but you're an extension which is killing
its and which we'd

354
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,700
which we'll generates a

355
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,020
mckarrick amount with this is very
similar out was a a rich sound

356
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,539
a features added to from the river to
its

357
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:34,760
that you can generate some your commands
and of course you can

358
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,049
but see XO at import some UI is saw you
have something you Bryza

359
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:43,320
used a you put in your buffer go to bed
up

360
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,179
and bass as a request and everything
will be defined from zuri always

361
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,730
add mmm and default value for

362
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,650
user janzen sick like that tall speeches
for

363
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,010
and this is a

364
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,120
semper you have posts week West

365
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,070
and wheeze kooky so if there's no way to
use

366
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:13,080
a to use them could be you are hired to
extract as he said

367
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,250
information so you sent to the Celtics
10 Sun

368
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,150
and you have this command line so if
your customer

369
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,669
dues not do not to use the bell

370
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:28,900
you use it is this austerity and use and
every proof of concept as

371
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,020
Acciona come on so every

372
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,049
everybody can sit that the with a bank
CD with nynex

373
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:38,130
and a just need to

374
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,530
fast as he's come on and then you can is
it can reproduce your

375
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,679
findings not be

376
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:53,679
I doubt Paso inferred FB lights I will
not show every payloads as a lot of them

377
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,960
in just a few

378
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,460
and which are not there when known a

379
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,100
basic authentication nobody that I drove
around so

380
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,110
a you publication it's very simple he
says it all the way to

381
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,280
complicates access to Web applications I

382
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,730
you ever either you love the world which
is basic and you have the bay 64 string

383
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,159
and so if you press conform HB you have

384
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,150
is this kind of book that which we hope
and and your value and that he could

385
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,770
lead by you

386
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:27,610
okay a.m. so I will probably not make
friends with an ex lied

387
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,240
okay I so if you look too

388
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,490
drugs a everybody's wrong a

389
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,390
on you is a is a way to

390
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,390
to do that is is a UserPref fix

391
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,200
us to fix a sneaky so is a brief cases
admin

392
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,470
colon for example also praises as to fix

393
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,520
is a bathwater or ABC 123

394
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,940
and then you will but for us it was
about and oh you use some

395
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,870
precompiled at least that regenerates
outside with your shell script or

396
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,120
something else but

397
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,650
we should have a way to do it better

398
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,590
so you exert custom either adopt bailout
which she's

399
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,149
exactly what we are looking for if you
look to the documentation

400
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:19,600
I if the fine eight different position

401
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,730
each position easily stuff eat them with
naps not separate of

402
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,040
that 8 sets ethically enough for brute
forcing

403
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,640
a

404
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,520
HTTP basic authentication and

405
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,700
has only one drug which was right and
nobody noticed blood that

406
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,610
e his guy Richard up the committee some
critters okay said to you I just to put

407
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,330
my points

408
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,650
and this is 0 to do it and you would
take your week with you I

409
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,280
lights the bay 64 string and you'll
would be fine

410
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,210
a 1 p.m. location so and then you are
occurs to me director

411
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,330
you have two positions one is is just
one he's

412
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,630
at least a few the name with a coat on
in order to

413
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,340
as separate from the bus was a second
please turn is a list of bus wat

414
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,720
you out wanna Assocs on the 1p don't
fall into the point of view

415
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,730
and so you can apply was producing to
specifics payload

416
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,220
so you apply at bay 64 encoding and

417
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,280
a of course you sure you sure that you
take

418
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,350
is the paler than cutting which is
checked by default

419
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,290
because if you don't use OCZ you equal
correct else will be included two best

420
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,300
and free day

421
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,500
and you have no way to find the very
best watches way

422
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,700
and so is this is a way to do it and

423
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,570
once thats you are just some 02 I mean
zero-g_

424
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,790
sobered to logic BI and this way to do
it

425
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,670
you can use some was away a you still
have your custom directo

426
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,410
just be the with the Sun is username
sensible policeman

427
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,410
is one single string which is called on

428
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,760
is entirely stuff us what Zen least us
to fix

429
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,550
for example or a XK mission ma call

430
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,480
some yells or something else and you
keep your bus possessing an inkling

431
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,210
and January you can get this kind of

432
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,230
output which is generated as a Kiwi the
previews

433
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,610
a way to do it so you have your login
you have to bus flawed and you %uh the

434
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,230
suffix

435
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,330
and so in fact %uh folks over the Sun
one to for the koran

436
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:32,330
free for the bus what and for pacific's
for back that up

437
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,610
sup independence to matts

438
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,210
GC a.m. with West so you love

439
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,500
something its profile but its be you
have

440
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,580
atomic though its name is both mmm the
listing

441
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,280
and then you have a huge brother that up
and

442
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,750
its annual an answer which looks like
you oughtn't tetons education

443
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,060
cell it surprising it surprising because
you have no cookies

444
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,950
salt ok would you be looking to bttm to
the education issue have no cookies

445
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,340
it does if you possibility is up

446
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,530
the took an I mean this one is your
cookie

447
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,030
but he's not in the cookie it seemed get
to meet us disease

448
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,480
in safe because I've was arrested around
everything by you know

449
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,330
you should not stuff a station ID in get
on a golf

450
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,500
see one solution each party guest
mechanism

451
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,520
just the Cliq a sex application

452
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,690
that you should not be authenticated all
set sorry son

453
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,760
the season with a tradition that up and
this became to be interesting

454
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,270
is it checked set aside if ET's its okay

455
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,780
and if it's not you have a big problem
still

456
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,380
from the documentation you have abated
which will 6

457
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,080
sick say cuts through base ring what and
go without a time

458
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,820
implementing the as key cut as a teller
yeah but what so it's very simple

459
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,060
but it's very 2004 so

460
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,200
we use the we we are lights in CC huge
brother that a

461
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,280
we'll defines a bit I type at as

462
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,050
current there from Bell and then run an

463
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,850
you we get some strange output so is he
sees

464
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,470
a expected from the response use it
using

465
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,060
Rep extracts from the introductions and

466
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,530
you would see that's the name was
application will change and then later

467
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,060
the UAV over the user weeks and and
later

468
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,140
is a GATT the rights at the Rock sausage
the surprising

469
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,940
we all loved with you a the again 61
right

470
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,150
and with you previously is what one
right

471
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,310
so plez sees encrypted data

472
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,370
as he sees as though XO or

473
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,450
a PCB he couldn't BC BC a

474
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,170
because we poets crypto but a

475
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,810
if it CBC when you modify the first that
we should modify system online

476
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,000
and year we modify one value

477
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,380
each time so it's not to BC and we know
which part is a string which it will

478
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,960
modifies the way devalue

479
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,050
and so that's why too bright on this
specific books on as a string

480
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,640
at the beach that cell this is

481
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,830
so we don t fight that's the spot

482
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,220
is rated to the UAE d and no we use

483
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,680
beefy bear and we define is a 8

484
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,580
position each beat a of a bite

485
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,640
and then we went to and

486
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,820
with the a lot of Thrones value and this
one

487
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,310
is interesting so know you we have you
ain't easy was he was he was the wall

488
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,740
and it whether that so this is a from my

489
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,100
him a training I do

490
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,070
and just so you have a lot of phase of
size and you get the swine so

491
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,320
you you you don't win a flag it's well
done but you need you i dooo and JD

492
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,760
Power also you can

493
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,720
do which says a and better but that's
not the point two point is just to show

494
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,270
is that

495
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,310
using talk tough rubber hands and its
people you can go from the huge brother

496
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,810
that that was specific

497
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,780
point a which is rated to the
functionality

498
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,540
unless one a CSRF token

499
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,040
so it's it's a mess fall but you're
saying and using input a and using the

500
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,710
scan and everything

501
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,830
am so

502
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,190
I we have an application which take at
two parameters

503
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,580
Dhaka and and value the company's along
by you as you can see

504
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,800
and value is 1 and if we submit this
form we get that

505
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,240
and information that that the country is
not valid and we get the value

506
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,800
of the valley took an I mean as you
cause its ability to Ken

507
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,040
buddy to be and

508
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,870
if so it its 9c a bad rap

509
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,920
is an we use in 9 CA as it took an

510
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,180
and it says that the two companies
valued and then we get the most value

511
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,840
which is 2222

512
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,740
and then we used to do you do and we get
be free for

513
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,240
a be four free exit the exit door if you
need to do that

514
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,550
manually its stupid you we spend your
time

515
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,960
a kit copying and pasting have any
decision I D E repeat air

516
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,530
its exactly what you should not do

517
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:30,850
so Rachael said Rep to the rescue frozen
the documentation

518
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,550
it will extractable son from the
previous week West and use it in

519
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,760
Sichuan's request

520
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,100
soul you get a

521
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,890
okay and you use it seems you're next
week with that exactly what we want to

522
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,780
do

523
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,680
so pitchfork which is a way to use a
different periods

524
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,920
the first no fast is this the one
billion parameter value

525
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,560
thats what you want to test from you bet
was interesting point of view

526
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,590
and which why from 0 to 50 why not

527
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,510
and you will be fine you on key CSRF

528
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,970
a some bailout so you define a permit
that would you still can

529
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,250
which we are you as a group reclusive
Rep ans and

530
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,280
hear you but the very taken for the any
subs

531
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,560
step and every was a step we use the
value

532
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,390
extracted by a regular expression from
so precious request

533
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:30,400
and looks perfectly where

534
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,040
and I am I may have a demo room
depending

535
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,190
I may do it in later I G and he faced
you have some time

536
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,670
or if I'm too late I could do it later I
mean I want to be of something

537
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,290
cell programs as he said only walks

538
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,660
if the Dhaka and is incepted ins the
reason

539
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,040
bite page so if you have a formula from

540
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,280
which Anna

541
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,280
on doings the in

542
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,290
present things a farm and at the springs
a razor

543
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,550
seizes the right esta now you to use as
this kind of thing

544
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,450
this kind of mechanism and you can you
must use

545
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,760
on the one thread because issues one

546
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,929
one at moes on once where the a you will
achieve your took an

547
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,649
a

548
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,049
a as shot II soon as you'll fetchit so
it will not walk

549
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:24,059
but is this is a similar issue use

550
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:27,559
Michael Bay's solution no deal in order
to bypass

551
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,960
as kind of the guns but this Alicia

552
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,369
is twice festivals is an a

553
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:37,849
Michael Bay's conduct that so I just eat
some

554
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:41,159
benchmark and just a few hours ago

555
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,760
and a depending on oh you set up your
micro

556
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,760
you could be the to of free time slow

557
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,859
so well as on using reclusive wept so
it's ready

558
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:55,250
a.m. am interesting to use this kind of
stuff

559
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,250
and Press a a lot of guys afraid of my
flaws

560
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,700
souls that's the way to red sauce the
CISF predicted forms without using my

561
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,119
purse

562
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,369
Anzac the output so I

563
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:13,369
as you can see we strike some by use EF
and we

564
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:16,549
use them as the next at a

565
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:20,289
request so that exactly what we are
looking for and then

566
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:24,380
somewhere you we it's the value for the
free and then you will win a frack

567
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,599
so you win and you need to go to the
next

568
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,430
still a ever demo but maybe later

569
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,839
more by applications a

570
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,309
move by the biggest fans we have more
and more

571
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:43,289
a move by the peace and to test them and
a few tweaks

572
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:46,619
at to a secret direction so you are
using

573
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,130
I for example to 'em on parade
smartphone which is what even

574
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,910
and you see want to use you usual
approval and two bucks

575
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,890
so you set on you set up a proxy mister
now which is turning on the

576
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,210
public interface a I mean to be care

577
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,910
on your testing network not to be and
Internet

578
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,319
which could be dangerous issue if people
can access your

579
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:13,849
that the mister now it's not a good
thing for you

580
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:17,510
the okay rich documentation at six pain

581
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,369
and I saw you in style as epic as
sandwiches boxes or a than you configure

582
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:23,660
to redirect to your butt

583
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,930
they open stance and you can use up
specific Aug robata a proxy

584
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,250
boxing to bed up and do not forget to
check

585
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,660
edginess proxy which is not checked by
default boo but

586
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,589
which will be useful a nature so

587
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,940
results a listening on on

588
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,529
all interfaces including za on one

589
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:50,779
and this is a proxy the way then

590
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:54,730
also we it's in French inform people and
that's winning friends

591
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,839
a mmm so as not to bother him so you
will do

592
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,940
up specific book seeing you we have
boxes raisa and you will redirect to

593
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,079
your

594
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,240
remote belly-up a instance and the

595
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,000
mmm DNS IPs Chinese somewhat lower

596
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,680
but you need to check it and then you
see is this kind of weak West in your

597
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,260
butt proxy so it's a

598
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,279
it's from the smartphone and so you you
reach your goal you you have

599
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:30,650
every traffic comic coming from the
smartphone to you or debited stance

600
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,230
and going to the targets an application
and

601
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,680
as that's why it's useful to checked the
dennis box

602
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,069
proxy up some issue or if you are
reserving DNS to your proxy

603
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:47,630
and that your proxies BEP you can use
some specific

604
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,660
a with teen

605
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,410
request a GDP bill and for example you
can

606
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,040
a

607
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,280
some rose your proxy story

608
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,530
a from as you're outside using as this
kind a few I'll

609
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,690
and so it's exactly is the same with
Qwest

610
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:10,820
here and their and thats is that one of
the reasons but not the

611
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,020
most dangerous one of exposing your
they're pissed enough to with you it's a

612
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,460
war

613
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,950
okay

614
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,980
so mobile application site using SSL

615
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:30,380
which is a good thing but which is not
very good for newt for us because we are

616
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,960
doing some Brit forcing and a

617
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,210
so weak the weekend we get discount of
be a few

618
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,610
we have a website but we have a red

619
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,150
process is not a good thing and if you
want to

620
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,590
start a Google Play August 00 placed of

621
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,170
at his place though at between a slut
because it will verifies the

622
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,290
certificates and a sophisticated is not
good so

623
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,320
no way to a.m. d-bag and your connection
to

624
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,920
place till help I'm every bit of it so
they send come

625
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,560
wheeze its our own see a such a
capability

626
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,890
so do not use is a a certificate from
some seem somebody as

627
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,040
use you own and you can and a good deal
proxy snow

628
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,520
absence and export in there so if you
off with the

629
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,030
is that we but you will get a fight on
you testing mission

630
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,170
all you can I use are your Brazil

631
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,450
if you are doing Janice

632
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,640
proxying you just need to eat is this
URL

633
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,280
and you will be done loads the depp's
UAE certificates so it's a very

634
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,110
convenient way to

635
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,600
their brings this that ck2 you move
mobile device

636
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:51,200
and then you'll be name from there to
see ft so no need for any complicated

637
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,480
up unnecessary command I neighbor
remember as he said tweaky commands I

638
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,250
always need to have a good dad

639
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:03,320
away and being me and then depending on
you and read their son you

640
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,980
can just upset if I all you can it go to

641
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,520
army to security in star from a stick
out in San you have

642
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,930
is do your bit upset sets the gate which
is included in the

643
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:20,210
recognize that the with CNN's anne you
get as this kind of BF you're so you can

644
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:20,830
deberg

645
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,100
at who they play and you can and your

646
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,880
seek application which is happy with
certificates and this is the

647
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,700
first week with you get when opening
Google Play so

648
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,820
you can span your time diving in

649
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,440
what is placebo and what is not in this
kind of a online which store

650
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,170
but it will be a all key

651
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,740
much time which

652
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,990
okay

653
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,040
you so faster

654
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,100
by default some rather than that of some

655
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,440
between the rebel torts which is a shame
for example iPhone and iPad

656
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,440
I don't camps except the except when i'm
looking for. for XSS

657
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,660
so fail berg as the action which is fail
about life which is %uh the script only

658
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,600
astrakhan loaded in your browser and
that use the startup and

659
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,490
a guide through ok shine and as annual
I've affair bag

660
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,860
in every abrazar in critique a your iPad

661
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,070
and

662
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,200
it seems a good idea to use as a match
then replace functionality

663
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,190
but it will not walk because FA a Bud
Light itself will include

664
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:42,600
the ed type is that you will use as your
market also you will have a infinite

665
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,060
loop

666
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,870
this is not what you are looking for a

667
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,110
but they have a could be there very
small extension

668
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:54,110
which she is a javascript inject 0 and
that you can use to

669
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,200
or do a few things like a and I'm
starting

670
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,630
fail but lights a but I saw it works
well with the beast which is a XSS from

671
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,040
ok

672
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,110
all to bun from with this boy if you can

673
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,700
millions in me that York lie on for
example you know in type it was

674
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,710
interesting team

675
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,250
the death when you are playing RP or DNS

676
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,170
or W bad at Rexnord up to proxy to mmm

677
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,460
to money to me that some fans and okay
so if that's a

678
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,620
abroad more by Bouazza and then see Zack
in Paris website

679
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,820
and I have fail Bud Light which is
loaded and so I can expect saddam and

680
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,310
looking for my for a second team

681
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,330
a strings and everything extensions

682
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,410
so as the

683
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,390
a few resources rated two extensions I
am you should read

684
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,300
everything before quitting your own I am

685
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,980
so extension which could be used for X
the not so much

686
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,610
a we see this one WCF

687
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,500
W is there were you can generate a
request from you

688
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,980
I wanna do what you see and fine which
is a of each year which

689
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,030
peace that we are waiting for long but

690
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,770
it's everywhere for an extension you can
use %uh excited to its

691
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,790
I some you can and drive

692
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,910
is sick when Matt from that phone number
as you can

693
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,830
a shoe things like adults not switch
hello to take notes

694
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,500
inside up so if if for example your
customer

695
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,990
I'll always YouTube only have a one job
a

696
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,970
to bring tools they are testing machine
you can I've 120

697
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,680
and I've everything including a way to
take notes a

698
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,920
mmm custom logo it's very very useful if
you want to the big

699
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,020
a you extensions a I wrote a few once

700
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,480
a

701
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,500
from so I should you be for us what is

702
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,620
you know that we don t fight with boxes
I wrote ok 1920 something like

703
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,620
my don't know less type to be she maybe
last year or the year before

704
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,220
a and not includes a full treaty from my
script

705
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,370
but it's very badly done as a logic is
wrong and everything

706
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:11,920
a but if you are in bed up you have ever
seeing you all

707
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,900
you so i dont which could be there was
specific buying these kind of moby

708
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,020
smartphone can use this feature

709
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,320
and then you are towards a days

710
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,950
walking from backup and use you use it
is this extension

711
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,610
2i that one either which is the max for
what he do now and

712
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,920
must have the job is an amazing
responses you know that we don t fight

713
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,870
a if the web server is for with us proxy
was found or not

714
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,480
okay so I think it's better to use

715
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,290
a Isabel extension designs a command
line tool designs and maps quipped

716
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,390
I if you have about the science of
course

717
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,620
okay that's the kind of output

718
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,460
a so it's interesting because I

719
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,120
provides extension but depth you provide
odes the

720
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,790
interface is a way to generate you we
both

721
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,270
and you can I so use the comp around 200
CE

722
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,720
from you on a a makes you on the season

723
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,720
or East is a tool is white all wrong

724
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,130
ironies a fat is a fact exact a reverse
proxy with phone

725
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,300
so this is generating

726
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,400
and sup request from a jew W with the
year

727
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,380
this is taking notes in that up

728
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,010
a know with this which it a spreadsheet

729
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:37,130
as he sees a free texts anti-seize

730
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,530
says you like a wanna

731
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,140
that's for use those for the rebels a

732
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,270
two points you out freeway to write

733
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,420
a Java on Billups extensions Jiabao
which is

734
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,970
a is the best way to do it if you would
like to have a

735
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,390
I do not like China a.m. sold by ton

736
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,830
um my personal choice because I'm fast
using

737
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,190
bite on but be aware bite on is not

738
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,260
g/tonne so if you are Evan eventual

739
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,820
a in have experience

740
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,420
a coulda in Python you we'll have some
program

741
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,940
using XOR Java API and will be

742
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,330
you have the same it is drawbacks and
bite done but

743
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,490
I do not know will be so I cystic to by
then and seen the kind of programs that

744
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:27,970
you will

745
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:30,990
have if you will play Wii spite on you
as the

746
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:35,300
genotype API and which is some

747
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,290
least of the our way of Indigo's

748
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,640
and then you we asked to do this kind of
switch

749
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,780
and like you are using our way but RA

750
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,300
and you can choose a built-in features
us that beat 'em

751
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,290
a item soul ons you know it

752
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,590
it's not complicated but you we define
the standoff program when writing your

753
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,740
first extensions

754
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,970
a if you are there are being you

755
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,980
we need to too picky with two extensions
and Zen issue click

756
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,470
is we control-click if we rewrite so you
will

757
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,860
unload and reload to extension with a
knee when click

758
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,960
so you don't need to unload wat once
they're gone

759
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,310
Key Club wat once they're gone its way a

760
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:26,460
on ways your and this is custom logo so
this isn't the only way I know

761
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,830

804
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,130
in the repeater and you can just focus
on the value you want to submit

805
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:17,320
and everything is a or geraldo TK shine
and coochie and Ortiz de Fiesta ref

806
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,770

807
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,570

function attack at which is

808
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,620
this form with value from 121 right

809
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:32,900
it should be as an two-minute to do okay

810
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,580
and so a no macro know the more I mean

811

00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,660
I'll stymies of

821
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,640
mean okay and is as more difference and
that's

822
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,250
I mean from functional point of view
it's already sufficient to switch to the

823
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,000
profession

824
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,930

825
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,990
by mediation on the end for the future
for example

826
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:39,150
which is you have some limitations a
free version and recordings a scanner

827

828
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,560
I usually use its but do not rely on it
too much

829
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:49,770
i mean sometimes bags are too
complicated on not technically bets but

830

losing bad self no way this can we find
it

831
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,120

839
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,960
and is meant so is not the CNN it so I

840
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,010
