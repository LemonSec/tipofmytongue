1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,649
so hello everyone thank you for coming

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:07,700
today we're going to talk about Windows
Phone heat implication security

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,940
well-run

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,990
my name is meeting that came up and
security censure in here peace calm

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,640
company

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,670
I'm specialize in SAP security

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,010
in my bile security team I'll sun-dried
Windows Phone

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,010
am high sulfur tasks related to read or
something and fires in

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,090
exploit development and has a low level
stuff

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,800
also I 09 its coffers

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,829
car organizer and my name isn't reached
those key

12
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm a software developer and I'm mainly
focus on gotten it platform

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,710
so let's have a brief overview

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,129
of to the stork for school shortly
interviews

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,280
Windows Phone he then we'll discuss

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,390
excuse to model them in concert of its
security model

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,600
after that we'll talk a little bit the
world system internals

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,339
you can learn the system so so you can

19
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,030
on the fence about the system works and
application works and

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,290
after that we will talk about the
petitions so wat Windows Phone

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,250
application these

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,350
out looks like and find it will talk
about the case in security

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,990
so let's start Windows Phone

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,830
aids using you total of smartphone
operating system from

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,549
Microsoft the previous version was
version 7

26
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,560
Windows Phone eighties based on this
same core

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,650
yes when those the and his arm

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,850
I could switch well the talk about

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,360
application security only makes sense
when you have some significant number of

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,899
implications and users so how many of
you

31
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,780
have when this fall in your pockets well

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,219
it's quite the same situation thoughtful
like to share of

33
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,390
is not so impressive by the conference
the girls and

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,770
I know that in some countries you quite
popular

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,550
for example we need to leave his footing
persons in Russia for example it has

36
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,069
eight-percent and we see that with this
phone will have

37
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,900
like 20 percent by 20 fifty you

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,050
but we personally though the system with
things it

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,590
love numbers like 10 percent or 15
percent

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,430
more likely now it's right and we've
leg-before

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,269
or please and maybe from the people
struggle we've

42
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,319
iPhone for second place well

43
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,349
102 mean number one of course Windows
Phone

44
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,780
has a soul applications for there are

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,379
all kinds of implications from social
networking

46
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,030
to mild-mannered in and it's important
to mention that

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,580
Microsoft he stuck it in the Windows
Phone

48
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,720
heat not only the to consumer market but
also to enterprise market

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,360
so the edit some new features

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,590
to this version 2 support enterprise
needs

51
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,080
Seoul now let's see what Windows Phone

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,150
he offers us from the security point of
view

53
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,819
wins for me security model

54
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,260
is based on several concepts for two
concepts

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,599
is chambers chambers some kind of
boundaries

56
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,140
which will also disclose occasions to do
with South

57
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,409
things so we have two chambers the first
one is called trusted computing base

58
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:39,060
all or no level software run in this
chamber

59
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,480
and the second chamber he's gold least
privilege

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,500
member so every noncore no level
software

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,680
run in this chamber the mean difference
between these two chambers

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,069
is the thats trusted computing base yes

63
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,400
fixed permissions have actually his full

64
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,769
responsive can do anything on the device

65
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,120
and least permission least through the
chamber

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,510
his dynamic permission slip these

67
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,099
permission said is beast on application
capabilities

68
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,209
and when one is configured

69
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:17,509
application goal outside of these
boulders

70
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:23,530
you can do or excess anything that is
not the world so

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,830
every application his sold chamber based
phone

72
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,880
keep it is capability

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,509
is some kind of a market which tells
operating system that

74
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,550
education use some sort and
functionality

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,699
it's actually the same or the list
permissions

76
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,479
Android for example if you have

77
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,750
negation at you can reuse vacation and X

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,710
to the Internet so education fails to
operating system

79
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,169
that I need like this new services
capabilities and

80
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:59,300
I need network excess capability and
when you install this application

81
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,840
operating system read these capabilities
configure chamber

82
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,100
for it and later if application will try
to access

83
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,750
for example media library to get an
exception there are actually three types

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,790
of tea with this

85
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,750
you there are people that have that can
be used by anyone by

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,240
any developer other active motive that
can be used

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,420
only the doc accessible only four

88
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,840
vendors and their early stuff system
capabilities

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,930
useful 8 Microsoft that a lot of

90
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,230
new capabilities some of them or added
to support some new features like NFC

91
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,730
your SD card

92
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,660
and but most of them heredity in order
to

93
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,120
configure every software

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,730
knows to configure every chamber for its

95
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,760
software receive their

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,510
hoops we see that congress developers
can use

97
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,919
with them 30 capabilities while system

98
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,540
capable to sleaze campaigns more than
for congress of them

99
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,800
well love them might be actually used
lot

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,910
we can still feel the difference for
example

101
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,280
if if I'm is a north wind developer will
try to use

102
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,030
vendor horses capability I will be even

103
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,380
install and test educational the device
so

104
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,170
people youth are declared you special
manifest file

105
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,220
we'll talk about to the later the
night's concert

106
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,430
you send books to it's about isolation
between

107
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,380
applications and unification and
operating system

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,960
there are several

109
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,700
basic points we want to tell you

110
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,780
first that file system structures

111
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,530
people from applications and all
input/output operations

112
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,090
Arlington to local folder each
application

113
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,980
has its own local folder and it cannot
excess local folders

114
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,380
of other applications and

115
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,810
application communication he's we're
limited

116
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,000
as well there are no reach ABC
mechanisms

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,360
liking them through it have to have
communication

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,680
is actually the limited to to seniors

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,780
file types associations and your
associations

120
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,040
so for eggs every application can

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,740
can reduce their that it can handle

122
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,820
so the file types or certain you're a
schemes

123
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,520
and when another application will try to
open file

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,650
this time or will try to launch legal
this year I scheme the first to the case

125
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,860
will be launched these communication

126
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,270
is handled by operating systems so
application

127
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,960
don't know anything about each other and
to what is more

128
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,350
when implications and those files it
again Texas

129
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,790
their original file can accept their
original file

130
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,580
only you can only copy to local folder

131
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,790
local folder

132
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,830
youth kind of place where petitions
towards the time

133
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,410
it's the same reason iris or Android

134
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,700
sprucing all is isolated storage

135
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,880
about in this version of a prison system
Microsoft million

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,400
local folder so irrigation in store

137
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,939
it's the thing three ways you can use it
in storage

138
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,880
which keeps he will you bears you can
use file storage

139
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,260
which keeps files and directories and
also it can use database

140
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,200
Windows Phone need is embedded database
which is

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,200
sequel cervical you microsoftr

142
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,280
also take steps to protect and
application content

143
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,870
and to make application distribution and
my secure

144
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,710
just fall glamorous in the Windows Phone
8

145
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,210
if a digital signs second

146
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,270
application file an assigned to they
some kind of check some journals

147
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,220
if you change some

148
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,050
content of a vacation you should also
change

149
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,630
is it checks on on Dustin with

150
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,380
these checks artists out to Windows
Phone 8

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,500
on uses sifted certificates being in

152
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,930
I'll when in style and perhaps from the
store

153
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,310
so salomon's a needle

154
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,250
a doc I want to work crime

155
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,820
and a final all zaps files from the star

156
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,130
have I am Jairam K

157
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,730
from you movin

158
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,580
dear digital right management system and
Windows Phone

159
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,660
databases on Microsoft

160
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,390

and explores am and later works in the
same way

221
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,550
as the wise on is a main difference an
important difference

222
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,790
is that you can't install application

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:18,949
on uses a static analysis but we can't

251
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:23,079
dynamic analysis mom also

252
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,100
by default developer can use a limited
subset

253
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,720
all been 32 II functions but we can use

is also works

266
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,349
for example you cam for example you can

267
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,730
I read content from bindles

268
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,840

269
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,800
let's move closer to vacations

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,990
as we already mentioned moves we already
mentioned

271
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,240
for me based on in those the score

272
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,690
use the same set of core components

273
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,520
this discover them three workers and

274
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,400
was heated so now in this for me users

275
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,620
big don't live version called or still
are

276
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,870
sexually the same version of still are
there

277
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,550
the pic civil litigation Ron

278
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,310
whose phone soon developers would only
use managed called

279
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,450
to create applications but no but in
this phone

280
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,060
he Microsoft introduced to excess

281
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,390
of PPIs the first

282
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,150
the first one is called Windows Phone 30

283
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,440
it's a subset of unity you calm

284
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,480
these ppl which is some kind of
substitution

285
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,630
refitted to EPA and also developers can
use those peaks

286
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,750
and what is important now developers can
use the difficult

287
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,970
to develop applications but

288
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,150
support of these native Corp you still
limited for example you can create

289
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,530
your service plus occasion used to you

290
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,860
have to use see for example to sharpen
Zaman

291
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,870
for creating your but still you can
consume

292
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,520
he these to eat the ice and you can
reference

293
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,060
on meaty flavor

294
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,440
their several kinds of

295
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,580
stations the first bite implications

296
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,120
these applications from microsoft itself
there a second part implications

297
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,050
which p.m. occasions so when you by new
device

298
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,050
you already have son prince told apps

299
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,290
the most going on authored by the ups
these

300
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,470
obligations role from the Windows Phone
store

301
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,680
and also you can develop and distribute
applications with old

302
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,130
Windows Phone store for example if you
have special type of account

303
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,230
it's called company called or enterprise
account

304
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,690
can develop your own cation and you can
in Raleigh

305
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,150
only please devices

306
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,440
also if you have developer account

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,530
you can develop application and

308
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,370
install it on your device in to be able
to test it

309
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:05,220
but for the school needs developer you
need to have the openwork

310
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,290
it's important to mention that normal
these

311
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,420
applications will developer application

312
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,440
and we implication does not have your
own graphics

313
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,910
so weekend we can

314
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,430
explore them be able to open it

315
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,120
your to open them and to explore them

316
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,570
now let's see what wins for litigation
look-alikes

317
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,910
so when you hear from this phone
application UK for ZIP file

318
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,990
which actually the archive which can

319
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,240
which with all the continents I'd

320
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,410
so there are different file types

321
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,510
their eyes application is sleaze in
various for months

322
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,809
both managed in native there are some
resources

323
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:58,840
like images all sounds and there are
also several manifest files

324
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,120
the most interesting this goal BMW W

325
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,470
am at manifest

326
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,409
you convince all applications specific
information to

327
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:12,330
like me version operating system version

328
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,950
it supports it also declares least of
capabilities

329
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,239
least of reduced file types your eyes
schemes

330
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:24,159
and so on now let's talk about

331
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,070
occasions security so

332
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,690
developers of every other agencies to
tried to

333
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,710
me their systems your and

334
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,009
solve it all applications will have some
minimum level of security

335
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:42,970
but youth just the one part and the
other parties

336
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,230
how developers but they their educations

337
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,830
himself the there's yeah

338
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,869
one of the main for it for a vacation is
the tentative past outside

339
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,770
so in Windows Phone needs

340
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,080
Microsoft is headed toward a few
features

341
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,800
and solve this features do you

342
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,200
the data and the disc past all sites all
this is

343
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,500
the place where developers should be
careful we can

344
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,590
divide all on their abuses into

345
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,700
two groups there verbally abuses that
are connected to operating system

346
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,720
we can call them both for specific
vulnerabilities

347
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,270
but also their common vulnerabilities
common for all

348
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,010
operating system and for all nations so
we can call them

349
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,260
place from independent delivered and
this is

350
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,940
interest in please for security
researchers security

351
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,980
all these years and this is also the
police where developers

352
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,120
have to be careful and now me too

353
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,830
will make a review of some column
application use

354
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,240
and on their booties you'll in the
context of Windows Phone

vendors

486
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,730
said

487
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,880
developers could use native developments
now

488
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,019
all developers lol to use seat last last

489
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,399
on no secrets that lockneys

490
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,679
memory he said dangerous and may lead to

491
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,360
memory corruption issue for example by
for a little so long for months team

492
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,740
or use after free are to develop the
Windows Phone 8

493
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,299
publication developers have to use
Visual Studio on

494
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:55,510
2012 by default all

495
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,639
persecutor related compilation flights

496
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,500
on dark on this is good

497
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,700
but still developments have to router
almost got

498
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,490
something is these flights make

499
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,010
exploitation more complex a bot don't
make it impossible

500
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,299
not to campaign these other platforms

501
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:24,350
we can say is that its and Windows Phone

502
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,870
is close to Android to while

503
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,260
mean I asked what a shithole such
memories

504
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,380
very fast do it too got sign in

505
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,799
so

506
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,139
ripping up we discuss review

507
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:49,010
70 have an overview or Windows Phone its
security model

508
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,460
and we consider it pretty secure at
least for now

509
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,649
we solve it in this phone the is

510
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:58,649
whether new features which

511
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:02,480
me to you'll kinds of attacks and

512
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,840
what he knows you're in these research
use their

513
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,950
PPI secure all security-related the PI

514
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,580
used by developers uses more flexible
them

515
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,320
I yes it gives you most please use
developer most most most please

516
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,860
to configure the Phoenix

517
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,889
but yet it's enough simple enough

518
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:32,720
so developers sure the me is something
important not liking the Android

519
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,700
so we feel that this presentation

520
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,260
may be useful for people who's already
familiar with

521
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,350
Android or IRES and want to get some
lunch

522
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,250
in this fall and don't make an
assessment of Windows Phone applications

523
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,230
so

524
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:56,230
thank you for your attention and be
ready for your questions here

525
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:23,030
