1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,440
so allow me to introduce myself my name
is

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,189
over lowry I molest her PhD student
walking arts

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,480
orange labs and my research

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,980
is about while self defending

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,449
the mechanism for cloud computing
environments

6
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:24,730
and during my research I asked myself
Oman rials

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,810
are detecting the auto light
environments

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,210
so first if my english is not really
correct

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,690
you can raise your hand I will try to do
slowly and

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,620
was a bitter pronunciation still correct

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,890
are you don't understand me but art
right

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,620
first if your are partially sighted
email something like that

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,590
you can grab the slides on my web sites
looks ok flash with

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,360
QR code you can grab returns is your
well

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,489
you have also the PDF version I will
leave you some

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,189
ok few seconds to do it

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:11,189
it what's on your phone and everything
is wifi walking

18
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:22,619
yes markets my computer work

19
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,770
ok is that today I will follows a is is
is outline

20
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,710
where are we today was my wares what is
the research environments as a

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,590
told you I do a PhD so I'm

22
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,229
academic oriented I would show your
papers

23
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,790
as a most impact important papers ho to
detect

24
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,899
utilized in Byron month and 02 I'd

25
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:53,310
from detection and go to detect i dun

26
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,009
environments and the reason and finally
I will give you a roadmap

27
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,649
or what is the next step into his war in

28
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,340
watch Hulu we will expect first fits all
these Asian

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,140
why we use its from is it for his own in

30
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,600
means that they need to know the Knicks
ever in few minutes I can have its

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,750
I can roll back if I do some other
analyzes

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,140
I can and fix my computer and in a few
seconds saw

33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,250
minutes if you have a big margin you can
roll back to you

34
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,470
safe and clean version and do it again

35
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,940
to do you men wear again all rights this
form are on the rise is but you can also

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,320
consolidates this is a cloud computing

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,880
iraq means that too often suffers with
10 percent load

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,040
you can gather it on one server

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,090
with 100 percent load you we've got car

40
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,190
cat gusts up you cannot so I'm a
fine-grained resource condominiums that

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,810
you have a small mention because

42
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,269
mustard on you have one percent load but

43
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,519
you have been retreated read

44
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,970
tweeted by someone and you I have eighty
percent load

45
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,910
animation its okay you of two hundred
percent lower than you mention you have

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,700
a problem

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,350
so you can create another server was
done plate

48
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,380
and have load balancing among them you
need more I'm

49
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,850
you we will have more gigabytes you need
more hard drives

50
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,870
you will have more and you i've fine
grid controls

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,440
but its deal rail rarely used

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,370
and is opens a sign of analyzes sue if
you see that you are under utilization

53
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,489
it means must have the time that you are
been

54
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,819
analyzed not a good sign we can use its

55
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,319
on the breast side bright side of the
force was amused some books

56
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,319
Boozer VMware Player I think must have
you know

57
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,620
VMware Player raise your hand

58
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,900
yes you understand my English is you

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,000
pretty cool but

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,620
between leave no traces you can roll
back whenever you want

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,890
you will be cool you can see the
Colonels if you are devoted

62
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,470
Gannett's once in your life you know
that it's pretty hard to do

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,299
when you do a mistake sick but you have
to reboot wait 10 minutes because you

64
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,840
aren't with you on the server

65
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,080
how do it again but over it that's a
pretty good

66
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,770
to try other OS's operating systems you
can hide your Linux

67
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,150
on your Windows and even your windows in
Linux in your Windows

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,650
and for some on the dark side of the
force

69
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,950
we can intercept what is behind 0s

70
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,460
and the physical components

71
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,360
means that I have my operating system
now

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,930
my next grouping a system

73
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,800
it means that my US will be built on
lies hoping

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,409
during the run and between intercepts

75
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,090
and I'd himself was process of
facilities

76
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,849
I was becoming more about it later it is
also the you to make up the station

77
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:08,240
because it's done to be

78
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,190
up item so it's mainly for testing
purposes

79
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,000
get saudi-ization it for testing

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,380
on the monocytes the lovely dissected

81
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,870
she knows some boxes such as a Newbie
smile where

82
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,969
Jeff I malware was few cookbooks

83
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:29,419
produce you know it okay you

84
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,960
they have at the table behavior means
that lives are built on lies

85
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
and analyzed there was just so open a
calculator

86
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,700
so it's clean by present some books if
it's not

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,850
they would drop a back door is it also

88
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,030
few weeks ago Alex thats peak
recommended

89
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,810
to malware writers but it's tough
recommendations such as

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,979
seek memory use a just as disk usage use

91
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,960
custom crypto what for logging watch for
deer burger

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,440
nvm detection this is what we do today

93
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,530
so on the bright side

94
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,600
my were made to take utilize the
merriment they adopt green behavior

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
and we can do targeted attacks means
that I am

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,060
on KVM virtualization if I want

97
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,990
I can use mouse on the large exploits if
it's been walking on your computer

98
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,250
and explains a KVM meadow

99
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,669
so just that simple you understood you
have one or 0 if you are

100
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,770
on a clean Meissen you have one a row if
you own

101
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,970
its allies environment a right on the
dockside

102
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,780
so we heard soviet saudi-ization layer
the green part

103
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,729
you know we had the malware the red
about the bad one

104
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,080
up on the other side with many men zai
ni

105
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,539
games so let's say an MMO RPG

106
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,690
with chief engine diction

107
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,330
but not want abuts to play for you

108
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,669
so the game the red spot as a green part

109
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:10,940
the good one we can

110
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,990
her bypassed seasons interdiction

111
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,720
and bypass protectionist fake cobbler

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,590
give you some skimmers

113
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,419
was the first one in red is what happens
on your operating system so my chin but

114
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,020
send keystrokes and mouse moves

115
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,590
to the counter was a PI as and send it
to the game

116
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,660
pretty easy to detect its you can find
some there too and you're ready to go

117
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,740
on the other side the signal line you
have

118
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,130
the same with VMM 0 proviso just
transition Bayer

119
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,780
so much in both isms a proviso you would
send keystrokes

120
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,270
was interrupt vectors you send it to
your VM M

121
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,360
that would send it to your game the game

122
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,770
cannot see you so this is the UT made

123
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,349
cheat and Jim

124
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,599
so with leading we have on one side

125
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,090
Mon where investors motorists who died
Dec some

126
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,599
and we have games against

127
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,039
generalization but or even

128
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,900
out to detective utilized in government
is it easier to hide

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,819
to detect first to be clear

130
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:31,240
I will do a targeted escape against to
do some books

131
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,539
I tried week ago it was pretty is in

132
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,150
few minutes some books on there in
months have to extract executable

133
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,709
actions

134
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,919
find what she's doing finds environment

135
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,030
friends are ridge's to modify
modifications

136
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,670
and send its to the login server to add
to bag

137
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,250
and results so

138
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,459
I simply send has been shit

139
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:01,300
this is a screenshot above the some
books

140
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,640
on Mon where that come and they've
listed

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,110
loaded dealers for my program so you can
see ante Q

142
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,110
wait for it here

143
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,220
and you get easily stopped at can use is
a week just one

144
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,800
nope because you're partially blinded

145
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,610
here you have a random the low

146
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,000
with a random name hi I'm trippin

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,250
in fact coo coo when his load in your

148
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,670
from finalizes will posits before it's
loaded

149
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,140
injected derail was around the name then
resume your program

150
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,270
so will have high entropy

151
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,270
the other name and

152
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,569
lower address bays observe them

153
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,920
I think a table so it pretty easy to
find defines a

154
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,559
first low to DNN if YouTube sponsor been
if its high

155
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,549
you know that you're under coupe pretty
easy

156
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:10,199
I'm not the result just listed dealers
and find don't repeat

157
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,709
up great here

158
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,920
but we go deeper want to win find
internet science

159
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,199
it's hard to do it with a generic way

160
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,920
means that you can detect Yorvit alive
and Turku

161
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,569
under our everything just the VMM layer

162
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:33,000
so profits ovation you not know much to
be you you have utilized CPU

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,130
you don't have memory but another man a
manual a year

164
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,140
inside the CPU you have information
tables

165
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,319
and each processor ovitz own ID

166
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:46,540
I did dissidents from interrupt
descriptor table

167
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,880
you know when you move your mouse your
pet's appears trucks send

168
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,370
went there it's the process was a new
processor think the kids Associated

169
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,420
function

170
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,309
you as Ltd look I'm global descriptor
table

171
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,010
and the problem is that when you are
being told to be used

172
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,059
you have multiple i'd it is where to
locate them

173
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:09,439
in memory this is what's and John are
found

174
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,640
ten years ago with the red pill

175
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,130
you think you know it's we go from 2004

176
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,209
to today during the slides

177
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,240
and in fact honor Barrett I love

178
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,120
physical motion when my ID is around

179
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,559
the rates 84 them as the I know

180
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,610
that I'm on Burma to if I'm I am

181
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,230
above poets c0 I know that I'm being
utilized

182
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,260
so we will not rise uses

183
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,829
ru I'd see address to see if it's still
walking today

184
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,630
we'll also see process of its heels such
as a process or brown spring

185
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,579
with a si puedes leaf weeks

186
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,160
eighty people would we do

187
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,809
and even better the CPU I do contain
certain is hyper as a present beats

188
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,939
security for on PC from want to meet

189
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:08,819
we'll see it also if it's working

190
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:13,490
we cannot some user get saudi-ization
overheads so small example

191
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,819
we will jump to your dress thousand we
go to

192
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,079
the BF Saul em muon so

193
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,280
veteran address thousand to

194
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,880
81,000 physical

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,730
address we which is a real a menu
possibly its own motion

196
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,929
so will become its own address and you
will have

197
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:34,560
a

198
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,470
the final tradition to big number

199
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,769
and see our Obito

200
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,660
it is without a bit saudi-ization you
will jump directly from the realtor

201
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,379
address

202
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:53,660
to your physical address and you have
less overhead so we will miss her a VM

203
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,329
entry in BMX it costs and we'll see how
to measure it

204
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:02,410
so first I was topped with a well-known
one with translation look a sidebar for

205
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,379
think you know it's you will gates your
gift well to physical

206
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,100
address translation so you want to jump
2000

207
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,639
will as the CPU CPU with a thousand I
mean you

208
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,149
the menu will look into the kilby and a
TLB

209
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:21,040
if you have the mapping directly it's
returned

210
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,649
you have a first tell the peeps if you
ever tell Denise meaning it's not in the

211
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,769
sixty four lines

212
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,309
the chili you have a page what bed
world's expensive you go to see a tree

213
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:31,850
and

214
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,470
all the base tables to find your
translation

215
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,480
so we will use its to reserve the Tories
Asian presence

216
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,639
all right Smith on memory a speculative

217
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,250
such as flushing TLB while VMX it

218
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,750
and without hiring hardware assists and
mechanisms

219
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,850
but how to use them to test the VMM
prism remembers I proviso

220
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,430
first we feel the TLD

221
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,269
then we will generate a VM exit makes it
is when you go outside you've got a nice

222
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:06,129
environment

223
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:09,769
we modify one up the TLB entries

224
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:15,069
gone far access time okay let's keep
some scammers

225
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:18,790
soloists so you we do

226
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,410
de France memory access so jump 1000 to
2000 and 3000

227
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:30,410
until you feel your TLB you can I have
hope

228
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,830
yes you can find informations inside
your CPU a deal

229
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,680
lips so he I'm treating them use
insecurity but you have your

230
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,710
till the size so new 32 entries

231
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,610
16 entries dependence if it's that are
instructions

232
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,589
alright so we get those is we do enough
never exist if it still be

233
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,740
the GLB contains only

234
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,089
our translations up

235
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,230
then I measure

236
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,610
on much time it takes to go true alls is

237
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,900
addresses so let's say we have a round
trip time of

238
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,339
folks photos on top 100 I keep it I save
it

239
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,690
then I do a VM exits with CPU aged

240
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,839
security as you know isn't non-veterans
able

241
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,160
construction from public and goldberg
weakens

242
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,600
you can click on the slides are some
things alright so

243
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,900
this review I do will go the VMM the VMM
will do some

244
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,650
I memory access because it as viable
some own stuff

245
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,180
it would modify sorry modifies its Mb

246
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,710
with at least one entry so the VMM
address

247
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,940
a 7,000 to a new mapping

248
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,130
have a modification I'm still be and
when I go back to my VM

249
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,630
I we measure time again accepted that
they will have a page from

250
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,060
page 1 with a tilde miss for artist one
address

251
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,839
so we can compare time directly

252
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,270
was for 100 being lo Veras on 9

253
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,270
100 we know that's who we are we have
got allies

254
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,440
I gave use it for 100 900

255
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,980
but what is the meaning of his number
hope the benchmark

256
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,100
for benchmarking used to know

257
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,709
time on counters such Isles

258
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:40,839
return from court tells as a precise
version with

259
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,880
&gt at CB not present on

260
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,920
every person so but comin you have a
link to do its

261
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,980
very well here going trick I want

262
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,690
hope you can use real time clock

263
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,190
with their at CEO you can use billiard
decanter

264
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,900
timer but set up pretty bad precision

265
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,620
you can also use I precision timers

266
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,630
with higher frequency 64 bytes

267
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,260
beats resolution okay you can also use

268
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,610
external timers to be sure of your

269
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,010
souls and you rely on external protocols
such as and two Bs

270
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,429
and simple and to be butts they are
really not precise

271
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,600
there is a ratio of 1000 between are
retained from front door

272
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,610
and 22 precision also

273
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,760
if you want to treat against and Sabine
we can simply

274
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,870
bus since be back at and the

275
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,200
the upset that we want

276
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,610
to i'd VMM her

277
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,100
presence up even better wizards timing
reference

278
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,570
simply do a race you we will create

279
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,929
two counters and compiles our values so

280
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,440
we take want red the two but on one call

281
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,670
with that with only needs to be waged so
will be an accident damaged MS it all

282
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,190
the time

283
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,480
to take huge amount of time to be

284
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,650
treated then we would do it read on
another call

285
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,020
with only enough so you have two groups
one group was on the BMX it one loop

286
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,730
without

287
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,630
BMX its we can present time in C if it's
a

288
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,860
ratio is good on its in different
flights but a goodie aged

289
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,510
also you can find discrepancies process
as does not produce is expected behavior

290
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,040
and British Eunos approve burger was
wrong in relation

291
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,530
Intel does not produce the

292
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,350
expected results

293
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,929
from the man you know but another so we
have

294
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,860
we had specification updates

295
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,270
for manual and what's is actually
happening on your process of

296
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,190
your muscles as soon as W conscription

297
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,300
we'd save thats you will start to

298
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,050
bites on the lower bites sure just her

299
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,060
say EA X but the to

300
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,390
most significant byte have undefined
behavior so you can but whatever you

301
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,800
want

302
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,649
we will do mobley AX 0

303
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,390
X cccc cccc we do with somea WPIX

304
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,480
and we will see if the first or txt CCC

305
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,200
I've been over return on it we
understand in the next few slide

306
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,790
and so we have specific I pickles this
is a nightmare for VMware bangles and it

307
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,400
all looks one

308
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,290
for exit the rated graphic and
drag-and-drop and so elated by Peter

309
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,870
fairy

310
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,250
shinners them yes

311
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,750
fatal attack oversized instruction

312
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,900
on Intel you cannot pass a on and Stroke
Center was malls on

313
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,020
15 bites you you know you can use a the
repetition prefix to do it

314
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,340
on this one looks I think it's better
books it was simply

315
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,870
under the restriction do not think and
use a hand

316
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,610
on the real Intel CPU it will generate
fault

317
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,419
so you can the text again and this is
time for the

318
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,360
small but I use my backup sites because
there is no reform in

319
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,060
up so I'm on Burma dart

320
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,970
this is my I'm

321
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,169
baseball's a remaining tests so

322
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,940
first three here this is a brown

323
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,550
process of transferring so bent on joke
or

324
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,290
in-home action database

325
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,710
our own with the most significant byte
here

326
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,130
it 2-1 we have the keep is the fire as a
present

327
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,660
so i text if you a deal if one he seeks
here and

328
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,540
would be teen it seeks zmw

329
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,890
here we can see that sissy sissy has
been overwritten

330
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,300
and we have the racial remembers the two
loops

331
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:13,300
okay so a good ratio on my burma to
mention is about 200

332
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,419
then we go to VMware Player

333
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,290
the run Springs the correct dual-core
agency basin

334
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,510
to correct also we have them as the a
2-1

335
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,120
CPU ID I fell as a present say yes

336
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm present I'm in the borough's and as
the value is correct but the race you

337
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,780
fifteen hundreds means that when I do
once a BU aged

338
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,640
I do fifteen hundreds nope

339
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,340
you know that you are under VMWare and
we will see that is racial

340
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,720
is able to give you a nice signature
observed of your Vietnamese Asian

341
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,200
environment

342
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,429
so let's do it under VMWare type 1a
proviso

343
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,650
this is day two as a No yes excite

344
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,300
the type 1 so here I am on the real
server with exam

345
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,700
young or something to bring strings to
correct the agency also

346
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,690
so through recognize reauthorization
resided

347
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,470
don't work anymore you upset is I peres
a prison beats

348
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,540
see that one easy to find but the ratio
is pretty good

349
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,000
here 600 not as my Bama time but

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,480
we can detect it is an

351
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,900
next QM pretty strange behavior

352
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,220
because our the race Houston

353
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,780
we know they will explain now but yes

354
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,780
the process around spring

355
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,860
reflect shoe image they would be so we
know we know that we on doctrine

356
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,159
I did two bases corrects with 81

357
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,409
so if they're not working I prefer as a
present we have a bit on

358
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,490
MSW this time as we do immolation

359
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,890
has not been under overwritten so

360
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,169
simulation and defined we have to
respect them on your

361
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:11,590
but we don't have the same behavior on
the real processor

362
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,710
and interview if you miss a few

363
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,960
and the real issue below 10

364
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,030
3 meaning that when I do want to be
waitin

365
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:28,030
I do treemap white

366
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,870
nope because in fact

367
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,669
QEMU was used will use translation block

368
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:40,510
meaning that we go to it by the book and
you would save when you go to the

369
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,960
does is address you know that you liked
this is resolved so

370
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,770
it computes si puedes once then he
remembers a resident

371
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,899
and when you card situated one small

372
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:54,429
you will have the results directly so

373
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:57,630
just the ratio after pretty good

374
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,970
we will go to the guys there is a test
of instructions and well-read

375
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,530
all rights the a great addition of three
was KVM

376
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,419
which you scream you for device
management such as them

377
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,810
we have the same process %uh run string
we are observed him

378
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:21,050
was thinking and by to fight it is to
not 81 okay

379
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,490
must think you're no you've ever is a
prison bitches at one

380
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,940
MSW is correct but ratios is time we
don't

381
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,030
absurd translation blocks we use see

382
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,550
other facilities is above 900

383
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,580
so we had 600 for VMware

384
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,409
we have nine hundreds for KDF we can
detect exactly

385
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,110
what is a paparazzo

386
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,300
final exam for with a was the summer and
spring

387
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,960
afflicting good deal we have the agency
which is correct

388
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,030
as the CPU eighty rejecting one them as
the value

389
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,040
correct again and we have a ratio

390
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,820
600 it 2-1 so you understood

391
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,500
we have all techniques such as red pill
not working anymore

392
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,820
but our race you you exactly

393
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,470
them just radiation and romance that you
are on

394
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,760
also for Peter ferry I tried several
existing experts

395
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,560
it's pretty long to do it and

396
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,510
I didn't have the time it

397
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,980
out so I come from the economic growth
so I like when stuff so

398
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,330
formalized and they found some papers
we've switch from a lesbian detection

399
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,889
intricate degrees

400
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:44,440
logical discrepancies means that too
have unexpected CPU behaviors

401
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,179
as explained before you have resource
discrepancies such as a cue me hard

402
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:48,990
drives

403
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,570
which is named QN protease its fine

404
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,179
you i've the string VMware in Windows
registry for VMware Player

405
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,360
as example and Jeff taming describe
ences

406
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,800
should you the ratio you are VMM
overhead

407
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,240
how to find them you can

408
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,830
use random tests do it manually

409
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,060
if you are black you will find them
exploited

410
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,320
you can put the made them recede in the
next fight

411
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,710
are you coming down from 16 think this
through their butts

412
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:29,590
from Microsoft Julia explain yesterday
because I me

413
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,060
until to be specification a bit dates
such as a food there

414
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,159
so you know what r the discrepancies

415
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,620
that won't be based for each process or

416
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,919
I would show you PDF of to specification
the dates just to see

417
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,919
if it's teen up to date or not

418
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,050
you can see them been some for

419
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,660
a no fixed discrepancies sorry for the
resolution

420
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,930
and you can see that they are many

421
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,150
want seeks there are about three pages

422
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,030
and yesterday I found the same follows
the latest I said call

423
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,510
not as well but I'm average up

424
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:32,510
we go

425
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,310
here so we had tree

426
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,730
keeps of no fixed and now

427
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm the gym this is a specification from
June

428
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,210
is a cell generation think a bridge you

429
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,280
have now fight but fake pages of 16

430
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,600
so you dare key fine discrepancies

431
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,320
from 10 they told you we we we won't fix
this poses process are you just have to

432
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,910
wait and to use it for

433
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:12,910
you mad webster for deterioration
detection right

434
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,850
I speak about use in Cebu

435
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,340
to find discrepancies as big abouts
devices name

436
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,410
and resource disappearances what about
using network

437
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,790
is in the truck when you would do to CP
with them

438
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:35,510
you would send its be packets the wrong
time trip with the first

439
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,800
for via tonight environments and without
because you will have

440
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,120
another stacks of I is to him

441
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,650
to go through so you have a difference

442
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,820
I want but it's here because I don't
have the time you cannot so many

443
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,520
computerization to evade

444
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,610
my with malware infection means that I'm
on my

445
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:00,130
real OS I don't want Manuel to infect my
mission so what will you do

446
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,390
I recall p the victor environment
discrepancies and paste it on my mission

447
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,610
said that when a man to work on you
think is built on lies

448
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,210
and with you would use just other adopts
a

449
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,920
clean behavior and don't infect my
mission I so there is a taxonomy by Chen

450
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,210
you should know it if you are into
economic Weezer extends which was

451
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,290
extended by mister Linda for you can
click on

452
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,750
you maximum also for them is it but the
motivation

453
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,760
you remember fistful of red beans

454
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,460
you have an instruction that you would
send on Burma Thailand the autonomous

455
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,990
mission the same instruction you will as
zip you to execute it

456
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,520
and see the state's after to see vows
the same I'm not

457
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,840
does the same so many ways not to wear

458
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,370
Thompson makes life the

459
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,980
you don't have a discrepancy here great
see me not contexts

460
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,300
and compare results and with that they
were able to find

461
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,370
20,000 discrepancies not unique

462
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:11,580
in few hours crisis with the same idea

463
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,180
instead of sending an inspection we will
send the money where

464
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,630
sending the matter went to Bama to and
determination

465
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,080
and true difference analyzes

466
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,160
we can compare a meadow estates after

467
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,880
being run on you're too old to be you
and no months a few

468
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,120
and in fact lives on

469
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,400
2 percent of Manuel's try to detect
utilization

470
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,200
only the worst use it so if you are
trying to look for malware

471
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,510
detecting peter is a son you're looking
for that and if you find one

472
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,430
send it to me please it's pretty hard to
find thinks about 10

473
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,660
for the one you send me but if you up
more

474
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,330
if we've it would be a pleasure to
student IFE

475
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,160
speak about the addiction but what about
the I didn't bout

476
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,550
we had also

477
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,790
has I've said before for detection
mechanisms

478
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,010
mechanism for mine is Asian with eight
er

479
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,420
determined know it right

480
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,270
its formalized the detection methods and
onto detection methods

481
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,060
and propose a first architecture and
implementation named it there

482
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,140
which consider unexpected behaviors and
set up several condom users

483
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,950
such as modify sybe registers to out
from

484
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,000
to hide its impact use show the page
tables

485
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,680
which are not and doesn't want to love
the BM and prevent

486
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,610
timing with she's its upset to the
future is a

487
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,160
batik also

488
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,100
we have the least you should know if
you're doing security is the least

489
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,190
privilege principal

490
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,850
we are trying to apply its to get all
these Asian

491
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:58,040
and to hinder transition effects only be
a time vital components up to tonight

492
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,880
otherwise still not needed to be
utilized the southwest through

493
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,480
think about a graphic art if you are
going

494
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,790
to use accelerated graphics you can give

495
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,540
passed through the ref account there is
no need for it or his agent

496
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,690
the program that its own on this about 1
p.m.

497
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,230
because you cannot share to graphic art
be have be

498
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,640
between to return mission so you have to
choose in fact between security

499
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,910
and utilization features because here
you've lost

500
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,740
consolidation and its reduce

501
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,490
hypervisor footprint so we are going to
start

502
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,300
same about physical deterioration

503
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,510
of PC physical these Asian

504
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,170
which is better or is it better allies
in results using

505
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:51,340
this realization

506
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,950
so the exam but his bare buttocks I
found his

507
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,070
I can show you after it's about
snapshots

508
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,180
use bullets in memory meaning that the
goods your windows

509
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,040
all rights say on the for the Commission
you ever meet our middle west

510
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,050
close which will

511
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,230
saves the state on the mission when you
are in

512
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,000
only Windows boots with the registers
with bullets in memory

513
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,170
the rum how drives

514
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,420
star its in the first hard drive

515
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,230
and stop to write on its and only have
read access

516
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,380
first ever mentions that's the question
States register and

517
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,530
and interrupts vegetarian

518
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,710
Italo squeak rollback reboot on a
cremation

519
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,820
below 40 °c guns in fact obviously
going hard drive

520
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,810
taking the and after as a the boot

521
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,780
so Mon where is executed impact is a
second hard drive

522
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:01,110
and when you are done with its you we
were back to you first 100 States

523
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,270
better it just doesn't interest to the
last eight

524
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,280
and you're ready for a new analyzes

525
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,720
so was it is a.m. best roll back the
type thing for physical is Asian

526
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,560
under false you can't you can also fetch
defects

527
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,220
and maybe mm formal wear analyzes VMM I
voted

528
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,540
a vote still be fresh in with new fitted

529
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,070
to do fall other assisted them

530
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,610
nutrition a memory and the

531
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,040
out some parts was is one is a available
code

532
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,000
it there was not available these ones
available so we can use it

533
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,060
bites its modified to understand it
detected

534
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,440
but it's cool so we have new
architectural

535
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,330
ritualized result I provisos speaking
about the authorization was better

536
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:55,450
but we haven't so research papers such
as no hype

537
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,730
you can pick if you took the

538
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,150
you have the address here right you have
also the hype

539
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,450
maybe you knows eggs and disaggregation
paper

540
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,970
rights you have confidence

541
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,900
that are going to use a space is under
the door

542
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,990
the hype is the same for KBM KVM as you
know is in the main line

543
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,060
and branch of the kennel so it's

544
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,600
Mar used some exam now you can use it
was denied

545
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,140
to protect its also new architectures

546
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,200
are pretty expensive to deploy so

547
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,300
even if it says they exist since to

548
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,020
2009 down not widely deployed

549
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,140
and we are also trying to protect
without

550
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,350
new architectures 118 is too slow

551
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,940
CPU you remember the two loops from
before

552
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,470
what's will it we will try to do is to
slowdowns to be you

553
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:00,120
such as when I do one not it will take
the Satan same time

554
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,260
as when I do want to be weighted

555
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,110
alright bets hurry steps showed that
unique

556
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,380
you need to slow down your CPU both
twenty-five thousand times

557
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,060
through hyde BMX its overhead not usable
today

558
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,609
also for detection

559
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:24,330
calling thousands a free MX it is
dubious

560
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,550
British fans usually on the

561
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,040
non-russian your heroes to be rated
Harrison

562
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,570
never and gone in thousands of them

563
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,900
you are its highlights in

564
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,000
you can be spotted so the feminism

565
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,150
rootkits to hide to the transition
detection

566
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,590
said the Patricia old let's say moore's
on thousands to view 80 per second

567
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,750
and hides mm when he eats so

568
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,800
when you have more than 1000 security
best thing on

569
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,650
you will go outside just said everything
best true

570
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,800
and after a few minutes you will go back
to

571
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,740
to take him back on system out so you
have the mental as well as picture

572
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,300
maybe she's it will be out in June so I
don't hurt

573
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,940
the students but I took some schemas
from

574
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,230
PC world affair and you can see that

575
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,100
the run creep is below 500 cycles

576
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,009
but it's not enough to bypasses the
racial detection

577
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,160
so we'll wait I think again

578
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,050
to new architectures because is a
mechanism

579
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,430
detection will be old

580
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,770
traducir a shoo-in time-based attack
reliance

581
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,650
so what is coming next

582
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,100
we are going to what CPU contains

583
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,410
I proviso

584
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,260
in fact we add software the
authorization with VMware Player

585
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,440
and through then we add Barack attorneys
Asian

586
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,870
to ritualized non ghetto is able
restriction

587
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,190
then we had out to our assisted
authorization

588
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,970
and now we are going in fact closer to
them

589
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,620
physical component with things that is
nuts

590
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,900
steps to Petes I proviso directly into

591
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,250
the city you with a new microcode

592
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,210
use in fact you do it said trusted
computing base

593
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,450
butts several papers that builds is yet
to disease

594
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,490
we have also gone dark on term is always
better

595
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,630
and proves they proved they even if
eight er was formally correct

596
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,220
for want to take some mechanism
practical is our weaknesses

597
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,740
so still if they have think about

598
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,910
blaming discrepancies there is a far
press ons

599
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,680
overhead

600
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,160
and we can detect its okay you have the
PDF

601
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,770
here I can explain two minutes but

602
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:11,990
okay so my conclusion

603
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,690
soon we need detection today

604
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,760
we are moving to the cloud computing era
so ever sever

605
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,790
is going to be its allies

606
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,850
we are things that scenes 2009 2010

607
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,400
but today we are not all

608
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,470
on just realized environment

609
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:38,830
some say yes we will go to its and you
have billions to win

610
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,410
some other things no you will always
have the computer a real computer on

611
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,370
your hand

612
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,609
I'm speeds I don't know which one to
choose

613
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:52,930
too soon addiction jurors answer I will
be glad to speak with you

614
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,150
and we have was out so new challenges
for physical

615
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,270
I proviso what else the dreads to put
snow made regarding tourism

616
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,400
process aw how to do it well

617
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,160
and how to prevent security weaknesses

618
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,480
thank you everybody and if you have
faced questions

619
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:20,480
here

620
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:23,510
Council 0 the speakers didn't have any
questions so

621
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:30,510
no owes the lowest
