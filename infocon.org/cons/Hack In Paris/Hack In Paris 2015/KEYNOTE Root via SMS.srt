1
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,510
goodnight everybody

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:25,430
and me and my calling Alex are going to
tell you how to get full access to your

3
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:37,160
3G or 4G devices and do it only by SMS
so we are part of the estranged wife

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,110
team and

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:48,980
this research they took many many times
have we here and there were many people

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:59,239
who involved into this research not only
we there on the site and gas and in this

7
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:08,970
research we speak about 3G 4G network 3G
4G network is really very very complex

8
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,909
and big theme

9
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:19,030
that's why in this research we speak
only about taxes low and about

10
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:28,210
explosive devices these devices like
phones smartphones femtocells USB modems

11
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:37,130
use bureau tours of course about the SIM
cards and will speak not only about the

12
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:46,500
traditional radio access but also multi
IP access and IP access problems and

13
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:55,670
this research is done not only because
we use 3G 4G networks everyday for

14
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:03,420
social network for hiking staff and so
on but also been king

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,040
government

16
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:15,020
industrial companies used 3G 4G networks
every day and it is this Kara sparked so

17
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:24,180
radio part is really well research at
this moment there were very Koo research

18
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,950
of this people like alexander to missus
song they research a great

19
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:39,500
you guys and we will speak about their
IP network IP access and

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:48,860
about this device just sent you just
send is something like final point which

21
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:58,170
provide access to the internet from
their telecom and if this final point

22
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,650
and butyl internet also can be accessed
from the internet and they are if you

23
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:15,400
look in four wards like Jess and or
words like justice and model names like

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,270
alcatel-lucent you can found really many
many devices which can be accessed from

25
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,950
the internet

26
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:36,910
next possibility is to look for specific
GDP parts TCP or UDP and send the

27
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:45,610
specific GDP requests and wait for
specific responses and that's how we

28
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,990
found these devices on them all over the
world

29
00:03:50,990 --> 00:04:00,050
from russia and China to USA and Canada
what's problem can problem is about if

30
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,790
you get IP address of judges and device

31
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,960
first of all you can look for their
specific management boards like SSH

32
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:17,410
Telnet get access to them and getting
side of telecom network next problem if

33
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,590
you compromised one judges you can
attack others just sense and other

34
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:30,110
telecoms with her parents home in
exchange protocol you can attack

35
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:38,990
UDP protocols due to be applications and
get the denial of service or still some

36
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:47,130
private information or still some money
and get the fraud or you can get inside

37
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:57,500
the private APMC here is an example of a
tech very similar to GDP since to

38
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,680
disperse include in our service but only
at the deeper level since millions and

39
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:14,980
millions PDP context activation requests
to the judges and in some moment of

40
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:22,150
requests is finished and the next
customers which

41
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:29,000
try to get access to the internet from
their phones simply cannot get access to

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:42,380
them next summer face of attack is when
you are inside the telecoms network for

43
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,200
example if you are simple subscriber
list of all you can get the internet

44
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:55,780
tried to use traceroute tour some
external board see some internal IP

45
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,790
addresses interests or table and try to
get access to them by some management

46
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:12,720
boards HTTP or ipv6 or UDP or some
specific telecoms protocols like GDP and

47
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,490
song and that's how we found this device
also just sayin also very big also very

48
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:31,320
expensive problem of this device was
that it gave us without any appreciation

49
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:39,340
private gibbons names what does it mean
means that if you know their private a

50
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:46,800
pen name you can change your APN name in
your phone and get access inside of

51
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,850
getting side of some private network
like banking network and or government

52
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,470
and something like a call from nineties

53
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,520
when your balance is negative you still
can get access to the Internet

54
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,389
by UD period class with Dennis to know
and song

55
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:18,860
internet providers pics dishonorable it
is maybe ten twenty years ago but they

56
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:27,629
are still present in mobile telecoms so
what can you recommend for telecoms of

57
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,220
course you should know what your devices

58
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,700
could be accessed from the internet you
should not forget that your subscribers

59
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:44,950
network are not your own trusted network
for auditors if you check oldest age

60
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,480
when you are is negative balance when
you enroll me when you are different

61
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,420
subscriber plan some song results may
surprise you but you should not forget

62
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,840
you cannot hide other subscribers it's
illegal

63
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:14,290
next fire is about the devices about 3G
and 4G USB modems 3G 4G modem it is not

64
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,790
only black box that you plug into your
computer to get the Internet it is

65
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,730
small computer of these operations
system file system arrays Linux or

66
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:34,620
Android on board which support many
interfaces like is the cards

67
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,909
management comports and so on and of
course part like remote network devices

68
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:51,940
and sometimes wifi this parts are also
really will research first of all

69
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,960
people research

70
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,950
feeling better result from this point of
view like how to update the firmware how

71
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,120
to change

72
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,390
customized if you wear or baseboard how
to unlock the device and so on and so on

73
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:15,200
but there were also some security
researchers in last day last year like

74
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,380
last year was found to be a decent
quality modems there were presentations

75
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,850
of regular account of how the four-way
modems problems and so on but most of

76
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,500
them were

77
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,830
have on the local impact and

78
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:48,760
we tried to get the remote impact and
here is the developers of Muslims we are

79
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,790
looked into but you should understand
that not all winner abilities along

80
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:06,400
store these firms because every telecom
company write their own

81
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,319
dashboards with their own
vulnerabilities and so on and they

82
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,870
security pass are also well known for
its disabled all the interfaces or

83
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,890
diagnostic parts leave only one web
dashboard with one button connect to the

84
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:34,120
internet but you'll see great enough to
have no matter what happens when I plug

85
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:42,390
in the device is that working to face to
the computer gives me new interface and

86
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,990
your IP address which by the city center
on the muslim side right some DNS

87
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:55,480
records open web is more than web rest
connect to the internet

88
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,000
maker old from my computer though there

89
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,870
internet through their telecoms network
and when i see UI be addressed first of

90
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,200
all I will stand for or concurrence
that's how sometimes you may find

91
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,450
something interesting like open
diagnostic Donaire and if you like it

92
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:24,110
you can also find the root password 10
get full access to the device but it's

93
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,440
not so funny

94
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,150
first of all because sometimes you found
nothing is modern was not so popular and

95
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:40,050
next problem is about that you cannot
exploit

96
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,139
melatonin abilities remotely

97
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:50,529
his brows are disclaimed browser this
why we decided to look into the web

98
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:56,759
service when their abilities that we can
exploit remotely first of all because

99
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:07,480
almost nothing or almost all web
services simply do not have some

100
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,389
protection like CSRF stockings and so on
and next to me will tell you also about

101
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,430
how to

102
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:27,230
how to attack the broadband part
communities we found many many in every

103
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:35,770
Muslims from the information leakage of
current base station I D to the

104
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,440
client-side client side burner abilities
like cross-site scripting cross-site

105
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,140
request forgery and so on

106
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,529
also willing to police about
authentication bypass like when you use

107
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:58,560
when you are being called is on and open
page recenter enough been called you

108
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,610
still can fight this window just and get
access for example to file system to

109
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:13,960
wifi then of course we will review this
you can change the

110
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:21,650
Dennis Ferrer to intercept the traffic
you can read and write the essay masses

111
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:31,760
and uses the requests read the contacts
and also look around they devised with

112
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:43,220
white rice can you mix the interesting
part was about how to get access to

113
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:51,730
self-service portal is SMS you send
success SMS found the browser of

114
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,520
subscriber

115
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,140
then sent uses the request to reset the
pass or intercept the music success and

116
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:07,150
get access to cell service portal also
very simply very simple denial of

117
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:16,740
service attack when you send requests
with invalid for this window then you

118
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:28,570
sent down invalid unlock codes and my
break from the SIM card or you simply

119
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,110
can't change the IP settings and also

120
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:41,910
bridge the device and finally last
couple of months we use the devices and

121
00:14:41,910 --> 00:15:00,200
execution of these devices to turn them
to the spy devices here is first

122
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,520
about how to get full access or how to
get access to the software is part of my

123
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:22,210
ass mess here is winnable page as masses
here is my phone I sent by SMS and

124
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:36,640
receives sorry you need to update the
page to inject the code if you see the

125
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:54,880
source code found clinging to our
injected coat next we have some hikers

126
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,740
consul in another browser which

127
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:17,459
get the comment received the data about
modern section moment then we reset the

128
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,520
password by using request getting your
password

129
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:31,620
of course this semester we can hide and
send the password to the hacker to get

130
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:39,889
access to self-service portal it works
transparently to the client

131
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:52,359
ground and then they can delete this
message sent to all the data again next

132
00:16:52,359 --> 00:17:03,899
problem is about all Muslims have fire
feel we're updating page some just hide

133
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,550
them in comments

134
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,950
some modems

135
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:15,590
have some protection like Syria c16 some
Muslims have some Muslims have

136
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:22,689
protection we scooped the functions but
we still can delete this crypt function

137
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:29,929
script and bypass their checking next
problem you need to get their original

138
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:37,320
theory to upload your purple coat and
but

139
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,360
you should not forget that most of all
web service on the muslims it's simple

140
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:52,880
CJI which get the video from the HTTP
requests and send them directly to the

141
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,169
shower without any checking this way you
can find the diffusion almost everywhere

142
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:02,610
in content land

143
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:10,470
heater in Austin GATT and song and of
course if you cannot exploit exploit

144
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:19,760
remotely content-length had you still
can exploit data platforms and those

145
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,820
parameters now we get access to the
modern

146
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,840
get the remote code execution what's
next

147
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,620
here is an example as I said how to get
your own make your own space device from

148
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,130
you can

149
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,710
there were 12 in russia they give us a
modern for 1 week for testing then we

150
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,470
can take them to the store you can get
the money you can

151
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,830
used for the collection remotely or

152
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:04,710
in fact the local in fact the system and
we script which sounds

153
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:14,480
current cellular base station by DNS
every minute or two to five minutes then

154
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,159
you can intercept HTTP HTTPS with Dennis
pushing and interests and SMSs if you

155
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:32,350
have a remote code execution and that's
how I walk in from from my home to

156
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:41,130
my work in moscow is the packet switched
on but you should not forget once again

157
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:51,700
do not like other subscribers I was
South how many modems

158
00:19:51,700 --> 00:20:00,789
able and used the script on some
security portal in Russia to gather the

159
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:11,640
data research image recognizing for one
week we found more than 4,000 syllable

160
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,159
devices and for one or two requests we
can switch this statistics just basic

161
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:27,429
statistics to active vulnerable and
remote remote in Section muslims

162
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:39,049
ok we can change the fuel bears we can
attack the client's my SMSs by UCSD with

163
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:43,430
precise script increase aid request
forgery and so on

164
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:52,580
then we decide to pound subscriber first
better was if you have remote code

165
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:01,930
execution you can update their but also
come down and in fact the cost with and

166
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,630
installing the malware

167
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:15,350
recent study indigenous 22 but more
obvious fire is about making from your

168
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:25,940
USB modem USB modem like Carson said we
have as you may know use be have mister

169
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,580
safe architecture drivers are also split
two day device driver us and to the

170
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,130
house basis drivers they were not so
much problems which caused by the

171
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,610
drivers they are

172
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:47,559
standardized and you are so speak about
the device drivers or gadgets in Linux

173
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,170
terminology one device may have
different

174
00:21:53,170 --> 00:22:01,680
interfaces and there is competition
driver framework for these devices as I

175
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,990
said many modems work on Android Android
kernel we have Android get the driver

176
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,150
very interesting gadget

177
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,400
driver something like a wrapper around
composition driver framework which

178
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:26,400
provide you interfaces and deals to
change their behavior of the modern in

179
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,309
runtime without restarting and general
budget that's how your phone can became

180
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,769
is the card or out the source and so on

181
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:46,029
here is proof of funds are available on
the Google Play it makes use became more

182
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:50,279
from your template but he's worried said

183
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:58,059
proof of concept first of all it meets
Hudak says then it needs some parts two

184
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:04,770
and a half maybe devices this white said
we decide to make our own

185
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:11,460
with USB driver for more than all you
need is to find supported functions

186
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,860
arranged

187
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,630
runtime find my by adding new human
interface device function to this array

188
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,260
restart the device and get the profit
but in real world

189
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,419
your first met some problems

190
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:33,880
first of all it's Carol do not have to
face device

191
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:41,250
gadgets by default that's why we need to
take them on board down there were

192
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,580
problems creating universal

193
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:54,550
human interface device driver of 44
every three modern problems with person

194
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:01,770
signatures with changing prototypes and
structures of expert functions and

195
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,110
problems of course with different
hardware it just means that you need to

196
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:17,920
fingerprint device before invasion it is
very big and

197
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:33,140
hard work but if you were good enough
you will get something like that

198
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:55,779
already infected vulnerable is modem
plug into the computer

199
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:07,039
get the new remote network device which
opens their browser by default then its

200
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:19,000
height or Abboud

201
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,430
and carries human interface device
keyboard appears and then some magic

202
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:40,120
without any fans entering the comments
like or you can reach the viewers for

203
00:25:40,120 --> 00:26:15,200
loading from the USB stick then you can
restart the computer

204
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:37,490
wise

205
00:26:37,490 --> 00:27:02,429
network interface

206
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:21,490
after restarting and predefined comments
once they reach their later the device

207
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:43,580
and load booting from USB storage to
infect the computer

208
00:27:43,580 --> 00:28:15,800
reduce the next best thing about the
device in the device and get the company

209
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:25,860
and last couple of months we interested
in this device its way modern piece high

210
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:36,070
silicon chips served on board which have
some different one day we'll abilities

211
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,600
it's not the latest firmware maybe

212
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:48,470
but we found also take over flow and
possibility to blow to their February

213
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:56,720
motive but not the point point is about
someday my colleagues found some

214
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:05,770
interesting stuff about Linux on our way
below two weeks works a brain system

215
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:14,580
which works on base been brought to us
and work with radio parked there were

216
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,440
many many problems like a scene 12
commendations to GBP documentations

217
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:29,260
problems faced working in real time
operation system all the bargain was

218
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:37,270
correct but resumed that Linux
operations system load week's work

219
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:44,540
suppression system image by well-known
basil dress

220
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,340
you can update this way you can

221
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,930
update the bike and so on

222
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:59,850
weeks works weeks works have seen
something like operation system shelf

223
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:09,130
for some comments have well-documented
objects and functions this way again

224
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:19,890
weeks works quote almost to the white
coat and these possibilities we get the

225
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:44,050
rector attack to take baseband recalls
for poor people so for everybody do not

226
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:58,659
plug in the device into your mother and
your questions

227
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:06,559
some problem because so we're told this
is no time for the last part of the

228
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,320
presentation then I shall continue if I
make every device that are already

229
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,190
mentioned by tomorrow

230
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:24,190
small piece of plastic mould SIM card is
essential for the customer is something

231
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:32,409
that is used for just connecting to the
network and that's it but for sure its

232
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:38,679
own device controller with braking
system with its own file system with

233
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:46,269
application which allows you to access
network to manage keys and do very

234
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:52,639
different things on our SIM cards there
are applications for example when you're

235
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,029
buggin SIM card in your phone

236
00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:02,529
there is there is a manual where can
access different products from the

237
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:06,970
from your operator for example different

238
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:16,820
different applications for managing your
contract and so every such applications

239
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:26,370
have its own ticket application
reference or tire for all applications

240
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:34,010
secure for example applications that
allow you to form your SIM card is

241
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,980
protected more thoroughly them
occasionally which follows your talk on

242
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:47,289
the to send us a message for for some
numbers so if you ever applications

243
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:52,840
predicted by its own key and if you're
lucky enough you can find something to

244
00:32:52,840 --> 00:33:02,510
force it because these SIM cards are
made from nineteen nineties they have

245
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:11,929
this encryption to protect their
different opportunities for brute

246
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,280
forcing for example you have rainbow
tables for British friend applications

247
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:23,370
but actually some of the keys if you
have no time for all all different

248
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:29,679
applications on the SIM cards so you can
just build something YouTube workforces

249
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:40,250
reader comments you have CPUs and after
their planes of devices that will render

250
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:50,150
their former forcing its refugees so we
bought from the eBay some of them if he

251
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:58,970
sees that cost you for about two
thousand euros we managed to make it in

252
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:06,860
turn forcing device and opportunities to
give to us for example

253
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:19,679
22 1903 million or 33 thousand troops
process and our device is about 100

254
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,530
times faster for the patient but
actually you want to see in this sim

255
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,010
card you can send different comments

256
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:40,760
well where you say something and get
some different replies but there are

257
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,770
actually three different applications
for example cut manager that allows you

258
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,149
to reprogram your sim card on file
system applications that come our way to

259
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:59,460
access information manager is the holy
grail if you can have a program you can

260
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:07,400
get access to a graphic tees you can
cloning device do whatever you want but

261
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,140
there is actually no successful concept
for this so we mentioned to access file

262
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:20,140
system on the filesystem you have
difficulties but only session once they

263
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:28,980
are protected with pink coat four-digit
number that allows you to access it most

264
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:36,420
of the SIM cards iPhones are not
protected with it because the two you

265
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,869
can protected by swiping the iPhone
Unlock Code Red Code and so there is no

266
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:50,330
need for another protection but forces
in from the telecom network for the SIM

267
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:58,359
card you should have a bigger keys open
coat there is no fun with singing

268
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:03,240
locally so you can take home phone

269
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:10,890
and the masses to overturn number on the
telecom therefore if you don't have to

270
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:16,090
have you with us most centers that
allows you to send such minor s masses

271
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:23,090
to any number of miners message can be
fewer children but actually it's not the

272
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,500
keys for different operators there is
different opportunities for example

273
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:34,590
Internet communications internet for
communications and everything wrong you

274
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:41,310
can just use figured out some of the
cells to gain access to the phone

275
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:54,750
directly coat and operator said the PIN
code with 40 and easy to work for us

276
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,380
many number of phones with the four pin
code them to workforce one device with

277
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:11,330
many girls obvious way to block all
devices so we can just 30 mins masses

278
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:21,900
and to enter the PIN code and block
device but there is different you can

279
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:29,270
access current difficulties or and
current education number to call me

280
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:38,030
device from all over the world and
they're great problem is that operators

281
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,060
are

282
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:48,470
that all craters I think that it's too
hard to do and just ignore you I will

283
00:37:48,470 --> 00:38:04,359
show small video that will be off

284
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:14,099
with this console access mobile and
access and connection to it on the right

285
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:25,259
we have not lost my phone iPhone we are
sending a sms from iPhone to see that

286
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:34,589
it's it's then we sent a 3-2

287
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:45,819
Nokia phone that gives us from it and
we're sending and resending burners mass

288
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:53,609
to get information number from it so
it's obvious that if all the devices are

289
00:38:53,609 --> 00:39:02,349
not protected from these attacks are
also protected because these miners

290
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:08,140
masses are not protected with operating
system but directly connected to the

291
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,609
basement of the

292
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:19,230
the phone so we're sending from us
McComb ms to the iPhone and see that

293
