1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,970
hello everyone as lawyer said my name is
Michelle

2
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,740
gianni I'll be presenting the dust
mitigation a beautiful collection I have

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,380
been ok so we all know we all know the
attack we all know what's we what's

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,699
going on with that we hear about it a
lot

5
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:39,530
everyone is attacked by a dose and
because of that ass as a as a constant

6
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,850
consultants

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,129
I start over the identity agenda today
we'll start with the introduction about

8
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,960
what we are doing here then we we come
along to the method that we are

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,019
providing these attacks I am presenting
these attacks for three years now and

10
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:01,619
then some tactics for the internet
something that we all know and and the

11
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:07,439
actual stuff from the presentation is
ready set facepalm Dlamini got this

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,900
presentation is to present strategies
that we see on all over the place when

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,150
we start and end this kind of service to
our customers and the failed that we're

14
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,700
talking about a failed at are
originating just by implementing bad

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,250
advice such as well as as I said my name
is machete Anjum head of research at

16
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,100
CommSec on security consultants firm
originating from Israel but walking

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,030
mainly in Europe that's about that three
years of experience in the US attacks we

18
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,330
are providing simulations but you can
call it a tax also it's a real-world

19
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:50,700
situation with two large what next for
three years and before that I'm doing

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,420
mainly penetration testing and ethical
hacking to customers as my second time

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,100
in Paris it's the first time as a
speaker and thank you very much thank

22
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,240
you sis treatment thank you all for
being here today and for this

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,269
opportunity that's it that's the end of
this self-promotion slides that your

24
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:17,950
level c I'll never mention it again now
for our method is is really

25
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,510
was pretty unique in terms of how do we
manage to do such a thing and how they

26
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,330
managed to get some insight into those
kind of these attacks

27
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,590
well the problem is with his attacks is
that you are either defender you see the

28
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,410
disaster attack happens all the time you
see it's impacting your systems or on

29
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,470
the other hand you are the bad guys you
are the attack her I'm not realizing

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,430
that just about you are you on this
audience by then talking about whoever

31
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:57,500
attacks or defense from this kind of
attack now we took two had of the evil

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,340
spoke and the good folk and then in
combination of that meaning that we are

33
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,900
we are all together the attackers and
defenders we are sitting as a red

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,970
diamond blue team coordination and the
blue team is on the premise of declined

35
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,209
and we are causing the attack on our
officers and from our boat botnet from

36
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:22,370
some evil dance somewhere like think the
Batcave so from there i went when we see

37
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,579
the attack happening we know exactly
what we are doing we know exactly what

38
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:31,440
happened when and the blue team is is
providing insights is providing analysis

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,920
on the impact that the system suffers at
the time of the attack together with

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,980
those insights we will bring it together
to the table with a red team and looting

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,600
what exactly happened when and why and
then we can say why and what was going

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,910
on what what went on in the system and
what deserves the Mazda much impact the

43
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,140
one thing that we didn't expect from
this

44
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,770
experience three years ago is to become
something like like no others in terms

45
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,990
of how do we do it now when when we when
we get to the dusty problem is that the

46
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,400
information about how to do it in the US
is something that is pretty not older

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,370
there are many many groups but not not
so many groups that are providing the

48
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,459
doors that are defending ourselves
vendors with a plan says but no one

49
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:29,350
really knows what is now when you know
what it is you eventually don't do not

50
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,740
discover to everyone to the world
community what is added US attack NY to

51
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,220
do that why do so in how to do so and
we're here to provide you with that also

52
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,860
so when we talk about fails we'll talk
about what kind of of strategy was was

53
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,200
there feeding off mainly common
strategies but not another always the

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,599
second part is what kind of a
vulnerability that they provided by

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,070
implementing this kind of strategy and
eventually how we expected this kind of

56
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,120
vulnerability all the stories are true
stories nothing made up all other things

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,960
are from our experience from the last
three years so as I said it is for

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,130
everyone else you gotta does everyone
will get their costs and I'm not talking

59
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,530
about the attacks itself are talking
about the knowledge of how did US is

60
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,880
walking and how you can be better at us
and we'll talk about that in a run of

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,590
the mill attacks nowadays are relying
too much on network traffic we are all

62
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,350
figured out

63
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,720
yes now we have added this attack with
three million hundred billion gigabits

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,580
per second but is not the term we figure
the deaths from

65
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,240
numbers of figures along we see that 53%
of the attacks are less than 2 gigabytes

66
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,960
per second which is not something that
is pretty far-fetched for banks and our

67
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,129
our customers are mainly financial
customers by Benson bank insurance

68
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:02,509
any other financial concepts and
governmental you have financial you have

69
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:09,929
institutional assets and all other
sectors but mainly financial so 53% of

70
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:13,999
the attacks are less than two you could
be that says a lot that says that you

71
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,029
don't need to have such as such a big
gun in order to being gunned down a site

72
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,489
and that kind of insights for us put
pressure on us to do something spots and

73
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:28,080
not just embarking something with this
amount of of gigabit so when a customer

74
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,259
asks if we can provide them with
exhibits and over gigabits over gigabits

75
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,729
we say yes of course we can but that's
not the point you'll see that you will

76
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,800
you will not need it and I've got to the
method in a second most attacks out

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,179
there does not require brain so no
strings attached no one needs to to to

78
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:49,479
control anything you just need to have a
large bottle maybe pay suppose someone

79
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,399
that have a large pot and then 22 just
bring out your your guns out and you can

80
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:01,129
attack some kind of a site many many
attacks I just UDP floods meaning that

81
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,999
no brain required you just point out an
IP you just point out to where to attack

82
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:11,550
and then it hits doing this this soft
bottom of the network but again heavily

83
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,089
relied on network bandwidth we see a
transition in a flatbed within the last

84
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:21,219
couple of years which means that
attackers find out ways than and

85
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:26,729
intelligent ways to find how can they
amplify their own attack why do they

86
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,579
need to improve an attack is that
because when you have a botanist let's

87
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,979
say you can you can provide someone with
two or three gigabits per second for

88
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:42,039
small figure but then it costs you money
to operate a botnet no matter what why

89
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,709
maybe you pay someone maybe you have a
botnet that you need to pay for traffic

90
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:47,540
maybe you have

91
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,280
you name it you have many many options
to pay for someone in order to to

92
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,340
executing the adidas attack now when you
amplify the network means that you need

93
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,300
to send just one packet or maybe two or
three packets and then receive much more

94
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,680
on the other hand how does how does it
happen for example again a

95
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,830
simplification attack something that is
very very popular nowadays is defined as

96
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:18,330
vulnerable DNS DNS server can provide
you with information that's what does

97
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,450
right now when an attacker spoofs and
then sensitiveness equerry which he

98
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,080
knows that's the answer for that

99
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,720
for the square is 100 times more or
longer than the area itself now they

100
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,070
have an amplified attack because issues
spoofed IP is the idea that he wants to

101
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,740
attack the DNA as receive a querer 41 AP
he he replies to the other idea that he

102
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,150
needed he thinks that carried him and
then eventually you have one hundred

103
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,980
times more effective or more heavy
attack on the network site now all of

104
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,890
those are attacks that we see in the
wild but we did it we didn't want to do

105
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,920
that exactly and we have some legal
constraints for some of their because we

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,040
are legit I can assure you now when we
have the potential we we need to be

107
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,340
creative in in the in the way that we we
strike and so we strive harder and we

108
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,410
tried to say to her two attackers be
smarter not because we want you to win

109
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,630
this because it's something that is not
efficient in if you want to test out

110
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,450
aside let's say you will need to be
stronger harder but not because you

111
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,890
don't need to have eventually a bigger
gonna let you just need to have

112
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,210
something very small which can impact
the site so there is more to website

113
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,740
then in front and that's the most
massive think most of the attacks and

114
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,440
we're talking more than 90 percent of
the attacks just doing the usual damage

115
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,850
to a site meaning that that is providing
with a temporary details to a site a

116
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,860
site is non-responsive for temple time
from the beginning of the attack to the

117
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,380
end of the attack or maybe a bit after
the beginning but it takes time

118
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,720
to germinate and then when they talk
stops for any reason that the site is

119
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,050
back on line now we want to to provide
decided to provide an attack to the site

120
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,250
which will hun decide not because we
level but just because we want to test

121
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,560
its defenses and Teresa to prove a point
the point is that is not just a front

122
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,540
end and you know we all know that but
the question is how do you differ from

123
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,890
backend and frontend and how do you
attack it back and we'll go to the

124
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,510
second so overloaded beckoned in making
the system work for you remember that as

125
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,870
I Saddleback to get to it now

126
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,120
the third thing is healthy something
that we call telling us just for let's

127
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,130
say no signature based attacks most of
the tools online have signatures those

128
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,600
signatures are are are sometimes by
accident someone does this thing go of

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,640
randomness and the other vendors that
are anti divorce appliances provide

130
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,290
signatures for those kind of overt acts
let's say anybody knows like just before

131
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,570
showing yeah great lake is a very
popular tool by anonymous populate the

132
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,260
purple eyes by anonymous as an attack
tool and you have pretty much for every

133
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,690
any kind of attack there if you have a
signature now if you are using off the

134
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,340
shelf or off the internet tools you'll
get signatures because everyone knows

135
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,010
about the vendors now there are about it
and probably they will deflect your

136
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,500
attack we we did we didn't want to be
there for two reasons one we need to

137
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,140
understand what we are doing and we are
not going to attack someone with a two

138
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,280
digit that we'd be downloaded online
second we need to be stealthy then the

139
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,440
tools at our online for that reason and
then when we have to do ourselves all

140
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,500
the tools that we are using our pillows
it we wrote ourselves we know we know so

141
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,440
debates and we can change it and
customers in every game any given moment

142
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,000
to whatever we want so stillness is very
important to impact the site because you

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,820
always have let's let's call it annoys
the data ratio so we will try to to make

144
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,970
the noises as the

145
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,810
little as possible and pretend not to be
deflected for the most of the attack the

146
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:13,279
fourth thing is Johnstown amplification
whatever we we we try to provide

147
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,470
amplification with with clients to
second when whenever we tried to amplify

148
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,110
an attack we have a legal problem we've
had because we need to implement those

149
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,139
kind of talks with a third party DNS
wealthy Party NDP authored by anything

150
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,779
so in order to simplify things we
thought over over and over again and

151
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:39,750
actually we've got we've got to
understand some of the attacks that THC

152
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,240
provided about a salary negotiation and
and when we see when we saw that it's

153
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,920
really proved our point because as a
salary negotiation and and and regular

154
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,439
session negotiation provide CPU
amplification because one side is just

155
00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:01,240
sending to use the other side is working
very hard in order to calculate entrench

156
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,759
numbers so CPU is one kind of
generalized implication that we're

157
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,019
talking about but is not the only one
when we talked generally

158
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:12,850
July simplification we talk about one
network application which is pretty

159
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,529
straightforward as we said the other one
is CPU and I just described one kind of

160
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:22,779
Scituate act but anything is is that is
being crunched is a tactic that maybe

161
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:27,600
you you are you familiar with another
attack that was i thinkin

162
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,199
CCC 33428 in there was a POC for hash
algorithm in all over the ISP HP and

163
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:42,160
other web service so that's a very CPU
intensive attack now we have a memory

164
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,139
which is another pillar memory is
something that everyone everyone every

165
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,329
processes using of course and they're
mainly does not think of added us just

166
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:55,970
think of mundane walk-on on a system
whatever system does it does without

167
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,100
with memory and memories is something
that is very hard to really know what we

168
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,029
are what we are doing memory leaks are
pretty common issue 5 if you know how to

169
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,819
find them and I'm not talking about how
to find him and Justin just attending

170
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:13,389
appointed memory is many times the
courtroom in strategies and the fourth

171
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:17,889
one you can guess it is storage storage
is something that is pretty much

172
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:23,139
everywhere and every kind of even
appliances along the way have storage

173
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:27,029
now they their plans for themselves if
we're talking about switches firewall

174
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:32,360
IPs ideas and he does anything have a
very limited amount of storage in

175
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,410
contrast to other storage is like her
room service or servers or maybe even

176
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,949
even if those data bases that provide
much more storage than just an appliance

177
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:49,569
so storage can be harmed in two ways one
is just too close the storage you can

178
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:54,430
provide a storage with more and more
date and we'll see at least one example

179
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,430
of that you can provide a system with
money with much much more than that it

180
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,269
should and then it can clog the system
the other one is the i/o buffer between

181
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,699
the actual system and the hard disk
which will provide you with an

182
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:10,779
effectively does not an actual do this
because when you stop to overload the

183
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,660
Buffett should be OK unless the MDF of
the drive was exhausted

184
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:24,450
ok so just before the start of fun just
some rules one rule is no shame in

185
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,340
policy no customers or clients identify
your identity will behind and will

186
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,380
remain anonymous

187
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,500
no pun intended now the second thing is
super banker from now on I will refer to

188
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,480
any kind of clowns as super bunker and
let's say is the same bank all over

189
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,390
again but mainly talking about the
examples here are talking about banks

190
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,520
and insurance companies

191
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,170
whenever you think but banks are members
of the most of the stories are from

192
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:58,620
banks and pretty much booty large ones
in Europe and the last thing is we will

193
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,220
see 10 remember it's common practice
Thurs it doesn't it doesn't say anything

194
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,200
about best practices we are talking
common practices here so if we see

195
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,020
common practices it doesn't mean that
it's good so never taken advice before

196
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,660
before you know it at advice is good and
that proved the point again and the

197
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,110
appropriate bypass an attack that we
actually implemented on them so ready

198
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:28,880
that facepalm 10 limit the rate of
income of incoming packets that that's

199
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,830
really good advice

200
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,410
goods and printed is that we have on
many of our customers the thing is with

201
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,270
this kind of thinking of in strategy is
that you have a bandwidth and you want

202
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,760
to save it for for actual beneath the
bed with it you need but actually been

203
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,110
but been with is something that is
really cheap but it it depends on what

204
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,290
the whatever you're doing with your site
and how intensive it is and won the

205
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,460
Super bank has been attacked by Adidas
attack and then it is settled into

206
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,370
themselves okay what what we what can we
do and as the ISP that was was offering

207
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,360
an untidy desires fuel level

208
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,089
defense and and I was beside you need to
rate the rate of incoming packets that

209
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,990
way you will control the incoming
packets whatever attackers will do and

210
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,470
then you can but you can always be
online because someone will know that

211
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,189
the incoming rates is is something that
is under control so first of all this

212
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,370
wretched itself is not not solid as a
whole you can't you can't really refer

213
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,309
to incoming packet rate unless you know
what is the correct rate but let's leave

214
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,429
it there for a second

215
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,440
the other thing is that it's really
really easy to bypass this kind of

216
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,190
restriction why it's easy because we
have reflection reflection is something

217
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,210
similar to amplification but it but the
death but the main thing is that

218
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,660
whatever reflects from the server to use
something that is helping you to to

219
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,809
attack the seven maybe club the
bandwidth again the chocolate

220
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,450
reflection to the rescue we have a
botnet win we have a server we want to

221
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,520
attack the server but let's say we have
a cap on our incoming packet rates for

222
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,000
for us so we we know the package later
we know we need to get the packet rate

223
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,059
that is most probable to be and we can
go very very low why we can go along

224
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,030
because the thing is that you have a
simple attacks on this if you are just

225
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,440
downloading from this site you are
implementing inflection attack why is

226
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,179
that because asking the server for a
file is something like 11 kill both

227
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,470
alone because you don't have much to do
with let's say two kilobytes in case

228
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,220
let's say you have other session IDs
maybe you have anything that you need

229
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,120
you will not get anything more than two
kilobytes unless it's under fire so when

230
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,970
you wanna get a get requests into the
standard system lets 8122 kilobytes so

231
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,150
that cannot be a limit for the rates
that you are asking the site but the

232
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,580
south will come back to you with with a
filed it to

233
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,169
with consuming the bentley did you find
this out as as it will be better if it

234
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:06,390
if the file is very big let's say 2
gigabytes two megabytes is pretty big

235
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,410
deal about it is pretty awesome but if
you find megabytes and on the website

236
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,880
that should be should do the trick

237
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,330
so if you send a one kilometre quest for
packet get requests for a single URL

238
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,090
let's say that's randomizer debates

239
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,860
you have a list of files and then send
it sending a request for the files it

240
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,370
will never hit the limit but then again
when they file will come in we'll come

241
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,679
back to you it will clog the bandwidth
so eventually will get the same attack

242
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,429
but now you are you are making the
server sweat and then the server is

243
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,799
again is CPU intensive many would mimic
maybe its memory intensive but most

244
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,529
importantly it will choke on bandwidth
so that's a very very is exposed to to

245
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:54,260
do so we are consuming the following
been consuming by reflection number nine

246
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,880
number nine is something that we
approached the beginning of the service

247
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,710
and against the bank was attacked and
then they settled himself

248
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,350
let's implement and other things now
very very trendy nowadays is scrubbing

249
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,059
services and other services that are
online double voting you with a

250
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:20,470
direction of traffic through them and
then they can they can be monitored or

251
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,740
your side and monitor the traffic and
then bye bye brainstorming with all

252
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,270
their clients they can say here is a a
good attack in there is there is a good

253
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,190
band with it there's about bandwidth and
let me take this and and straighten it

254
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:41,140
out so when when this kind of super or
super bank approach this service

255
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,559
provider they actually had a monitoring
system on this system so we attacked the

256
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,130
bank to see that a monitoring box and
monitoring walked it was great but then

257
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,840
again when when we saw when when we say
to them that this site is still off they

258
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,399
said it's ok monitoring shows that
everything is ok why you are bidding

259
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:06,610
with with us we want to sleep or
anything like that so it's ok now the

260
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,090
monitoring showed everything is ok back
to normal and and the monitor is

261
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,010
actually some is actually is being ok we
we we got this screenshot from the

262
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,100
provider saying that this site is ok and
they were high-fiving each other in in

263
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,970
the room we said we heard from the
customer that everyone was there was

264
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,190
much rejoicing and then they sent us
this

265
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,070
image which shows clearly I don't know
how clearly but it shows clearly that

266
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,180
that is the peak time was off and then
bye bye then by a couple of minutes or

267
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,740
so the attack was off and then that
there was a relaxation and when there is

268
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,530
a relaxation everyone are happy because
they walk have been done and everything

269
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,020
looks ok there is no way that the site
is under attack because you can see it

270
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,350
in the graph the thing is that they
didn't know is that the redirection of

271
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,470
the DNS was not correct they the
customer provided the idea service

272
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,850
provider with one of its I piece that
needs to be redacted and four for other

273
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,420
reasons

274
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,880
exceptionally for management of the site
it he had its own IP which the IPK can

275
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,770
be travels by DNS squaring whenever we
estimated a different in as indifferent

276
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,020
thanks we we got another idea so we
figured there is another open place and

277
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,340
we need to strike it down so we strongly
doubt it was pretty easy because it's

278
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,420
the same attack all over again but now
it but now they can't detect us so they

279
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,680
are very what was they were very assured
that the site is not down but whatever

280
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,340
you can actually check this site that
something phenomenon you can open up a

281
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,400
browser and throats of served as a side
and you'll see that the site is off and

282
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,930
that is actually what wasn't done in
this in this tragedy of monitoring is OK

283
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,520
and you and we all know it from other
security operations center but in this

284
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,200
case when you when you talk to us it's
very easy to comply to see if the site

285
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,660
is up and down and that's something that
none of them not not idea not the

286
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:10,680
service provider itself have been doing
through the attack ok number back in

287
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,360
servers are not important to protect
against the US that's something that we

288
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,390
hear a lot and I talked about it earlier
and I will be some information we had

289
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,389
the client that this will be a bank of
course was was under

290
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:29,669
I was under the assumption that the
front end is very important and the

291
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:35,869
backend servers was pretty claiming data
nothing crucial so he put on his

292
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:37,599
defenses on front-end

293
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,209
monitoring having monitoring the
different any put some ISPs put some

294
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:44,730
entities mechanism he bought some some

295
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:51,150
marvelous Bentley to insert system and
now he said ok let's let's do the attack

296
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,630
and you have to keep it smart because I
will detect you I have the most the most

297
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:01,370
efficient system involves something
though we said ok we certainly site that

298
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:06,730
I haven't mentioned it that research is
done a week before the attack itself we

299
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,900
need to know what we are what we are
talking about we need to know what kind

300
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,150
of technologies are up there and we need
to to test some thresholds without

301
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,620
harming the site in order to provide our
customers operation and something that

302
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,410
will be precise as we can so do you
enjoy doing research we found it has a

303
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:31,540
simple queries in a site where he was
referring to searching for branches in

304
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:38,360
agents on in the in those bankers and we
used that we said that everybody is

305
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,350
doing that by the way you should note
that when when you see a side of this

306
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,010
week where you are you eventually will
get ok so maybe it's stress anger file

307
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:52,410
but if it's dated need to be dynamic its
most broadly at the base right so we

308
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,530
found is queried and by measuring time
by measuring the response from the

309
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,090
server we actually got the idea that
it's it should be a data base day down

310
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,660
there somewhere so we queried the
database all over again we quickly than

311
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,910
queried in growing so the traffic was
week we kept it very very low but the

312
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,330
traffic on the inside was insane because
they did we didn't know better but could

313
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:20,990
guess from timing delays at the back end
is going crazy like every every time

314
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,730
that we create it decided took about 15
minutes 15 seconds to respond that

315
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,860
something that shouldn't be done in any
case so when we when we time and we

316
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,400
figured that a database week we didn't
need such such a big band width and then

317
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,720
we will eventually attacked the back and
through the front end and if you if you

318
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,620
manage to to to see the amplification
itself was self-inflicted so eventually

319
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,049
we have an application inside the
network and that's what brought down by

320
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,190
the way in other failings in this and
that's because that's another reason

321
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,890
it's here

322
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,440
is that these data bases in the back and
that was referring lines as a lame duck

323
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,680
is to just controls the branches in
agents was much more than that because

324
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:11,830
when did about database feel some some
angry calls received at a soccer and for

325
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,120
the security officer that said to them
are you crazy you just dropped like 50

326
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,700
data bases of the back and then they
realize that the database is shared and

327
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,540
data bases has been fallen through

328
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,640
by these kind of attack and again the
attackers from the outside so we have a

329
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,170
chain of events that was pretty funny
for us but not funny for the customer

330
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:39,780
ok so now we have again something very
very probable to do when you have bigger

331
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,480
plans to pay a very very expensive and
you pay a hefty money for that you have

332
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,860
an appliance wanted us to put into on
premise and you wanted to to to connect

333
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,900
your domain to it so you have an event
connected to do it and then you could

334
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,810
you maybe think to yourself maybe I have
another the means to conduct to

335
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,130
controlling that maybe I can deliver
those kind of traffic through the

336
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,950
Anteaters mechanism that's a great idea

337
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,800
effective be efficient in your walk that
does not just spend money on something

338
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,990
that you want to use rights right but
then again

339
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,360
issue if you're not familiar with what
exactly will happen when you connect

340
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,560
those in if you didn't figure what will
be the actual right now and what will be

341
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,430
the mitigation process you are doomed to
fail and actually happened in this case

342
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:29,960
it was it was over the pond some bridges
customer that if a national customer

343
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,110
that bought in you in the UN china plans
just going to the network connected all

344
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,430
the things to it and then the mitigation
was the stretch of them division and

345
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,440
that's something that was right within
in the documentation for the appliance

346
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,390
is after he is learning the traffic and
after 2020 second it drops its getting

347
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,750
to mitigation drops the lines and tries
to drive them out and then to bring it

348
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,400
all together so when that happened we
just waited we are doing a ramp up with

349
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,930
so we are starting small and then
eventually getting getting bigger and

350
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,830
bigger so we start small and nothing
happen which was pretty obvious that

351
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,850
nothing will happen but after 20 seconds
exercise this site was down without any

352
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,150
given reason decide was now not done not
only the site the monitoring systems the

353
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,720
management systems the ISP the VPN
anything that you can think of was down

354
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,510
all the financial organization into a
production system it was on Monday the

355
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,680
start of the day it was it was until
seven hours from then that this site or

356
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:38,310
anything else on the premise was brought
up to life and doing this they learned a

357
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:44,320
lot about something that was inside the
system that eventually affected this

358
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,410
weird behavior what what actually
happened at appliance thought of the

359
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,880
lines as Lucius and then dropped all the
lines and then give access to management

360
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,240
that something pretty crazy but that was
it for the social number six we have we

361
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,380
don't trust the vendor that something
that is pretty hard to say but that's

362
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,420
something that we are encountering

363
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,530
over all over again when we approached
startups and they have entered those

364
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,630
machines and and it is clouds that you
can you can use a just and even treat

365
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,100
that's crazy right

366
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,509
why not use it so you put on your
credentials

367
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:25,669
reverse DNS / reverse proxy and you have
your DNS credentials etc etc and then

368
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:29,349
you have a redirection through the cloud
with no money involved in something that

369
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:34,109
is very very important to most of the
customers now that's great

370
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:39,039
the only thing is that we are talking
light layer 7 attacks and if you don't

371
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,589
trust offender when you don given the
certificate we're talking about the

372
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:47,159
significance of course so the traffic
will not be shown on the service right

373
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,859
so traffic will not be shown in with
still getting to you through a self you

374
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:58,519
wants to the attacking so you won't be
able to control it or want to be able to

375
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,449
smartly mitigated and that's exactly
what was done we just flooded the

376
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:10,469
website with a GPS and eventually we
figured that maybe HCPs was not required

377
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:13,979
for the customer but it doesn't matter
there's GPS was Event Director of

378
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,749
attacks you just enumerate the surface
and then you'll find out which the PSI

379
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:23,889
CBS loew's pretty pretty much it when we
figure it out and when we figured out

380
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:28,109
that we have something in line that is
providing us with with some difficulties

381
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:32,139
but but then again when you don't have
the sensitivity you can't you can't

382
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:37,119
correctly terminate the session the SSL
session number five

383
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,039
we need big data collect all the logs
that something that we hear all the time

384
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,609
and mainly in the last couple of years
or so we have given preference

385
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:52,580
requirement other under several

386
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,240
under several occasions like BC I it's
actually requires you to collect on the

387
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,190
locks that something that is very
crucial to someone but it's not crucial

388
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,659
when we're talking about the doors
because as we said storage is something

389
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:11,649
very troubling you can be clogged by
storage and then you have needed you

390
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:16,470
can't just expensive storage unless you
want you want you know how to control

391
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,029
every kind of plants but then again if
you have if you have this kind of plans

392
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:23,679
in place and you don't know it

393
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,809
the plans will clog up the system what
happened is that we we attacked at this

394
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:33,840
this super bank and then doing tonight
when we attacked it we we figured out

395
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,370
that there is no access to the site all
of the sudden and we haven't done

396
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,309
something very massive we're talking
about maybe several millions of of

397
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:48,070
requests which is nothing like a real
attack yet so we just started and we saw

398
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,580
that the IPS was not responding it it
took some time to return to the bank to

399
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,230
realize that the IPS was the problem but
the IPS was not responding not a

400
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,510
management nothing like logs nothing
that can be managed noting that there

401
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,889
can be accessed and the IPS was in line
still every kind of traffic could not

402
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:09,070
get into the site the site looks
phenomenal nothing on the site no

403
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,179
clients the holy grail for for many of
our customers is no grounds of the

404
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,880
website what web server no plan tonight
traffic on the web server now when when

405
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,100
they figure that that's the IPS they
need to control it and they need to go

406
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:30,529
to the ideas and recent not on it so
that's really damaging attack ok that's

407
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:34,059
another thing that we've mentioned that
we are under attack lets users scrubbing

408
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:37,460
service covering service again is
something that we can switch we can

409
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,899
flick a switch and then it can redirect
our data through them now this is coming

410
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,990
service based on Australia

411
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,400
the same place of this customer service
said to the customer you can flick a

412
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,970
switch as is this if you are under
attack can just switch and we will

413
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:01,700
provide you with the extra mile that's
terrific but not possible because if you

414
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,530
have a learning mode if you need to
learn the system that's what's driving

415
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,850
service do it since it differentiate
between good and bad but with traffic

416
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:16,130
and if no traffic in its to land on
traffic in then to differentiate between

417
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:23,120
black and white it can be done during an
attack during index nothing is normal so

418
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,270
all is learned during the attack so
eventually all of the traffic was dry

419
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,530
because everything everything was under
without was under attack and discovering

420
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,710
service that does not help a dog
eventually he needed to go to call this

421
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,679
support guy who was which which was
which was in in his pajamas or something

422
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,360
because he wasn't so sober and then he
said to him listen we have a streaming

423
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,350
service would just flicked a switch it
to provide us and nothing is walking and

424
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,890
is that ok that's great none and nothing
is walking the website is off so they

425
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,350
try to mitigated and during the night in
up there are like three or four hours to

426
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,559
control the situation somehow and then
returned

427
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:08,399
retarded up to life but described in
service provider the set said to the

428
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,950
customer maybe next time you click you
can buy from us the configuration and

429
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,629
implementation services we provide you
that's not nothing good advice over 101

430
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:24,230
another good and not so good advice that
this service provided provided ok number

431
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:30,700
three and we are approaching the end the
Syrian is something that is very trendy

432
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,980
now it is a very popular city and is
like you know the clouds rest proxy for

433
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,190
anywhere in the world if we are

434
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,859
if we tried to to get to cnn.com and
cnn.com is located chill graphically in

435
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:48,060
washington we'll have from here to there
are several maybe tens of hopes but we

436
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,740
we don't need that we want to be usable
so we have a city and that provide all

437
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,660
the caches to all over the walls like
thousands of computers and Syrians does

438
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,849
not own meaning that decision needs to
be on static information why because not

439
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,319
that information whether what is doing
with his city and his when you ask it

440
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,790
when you ask us over close to you about
the sites load so cnn.com he will ask

441
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,760
himself

442
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,770
have ever someone approached intercom do
it does it does it resides in the cash

443
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:23,079
if it is you will be Friday with a cash
if it isn't it will ask CNN the origin

444
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,660
of cnn.com and then provide the windows
are from there so if its dynamic meaning

445
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,930
that if you have parameters on site you
won't be able to cash or the parameters

446
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,890
because it's not possible end to end if
the city and does not know the the

447
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,290
limited set of solutions are set of
answers for those kind of broad

448
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:46,210
parameters it will never can be done so
when customers buy all the city and he's

449
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,369
very happy by the way it's a very good
advice go into the city and on static

450
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:55,270
stuff on your site that's great but on
the economic stuff it's not a real

451
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,510
because they make stuff again it will
require you to go over to the cash the

452
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,300
cash is not there a new parameter is in
place and we will ask the origin all

453
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,890
over again the flooding methodically so
this site will be down because the

454
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,200
origin cannot control of those of this
traffic whatever what another thing I

455
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,160
come out in this case which was the
origin and no shame involved just sit

456
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,710
and wait walks and activists entered a
customer didn't do not use

457
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:26,260
and not started information so in this
case when the monitoring was walking on

458
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,520
on the origin you couldn't say with
attacking you just from where is

459
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,010
attacking you because the IP is is
related to the cash services CDN itself

460
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,390
and not the origin of the attack the
attacker so again not in cash as the

461
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:47,050
origin religion is falling down another
thing about city and the two have many

462
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,790
advisers that are pretty bad they have
their own advice that we approached its

463
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,360
if you if you search Google

464
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,890
for CDN origin protection origin is the
is the single point of contact when

465
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:05,200
decision needs to needs new information
and needs to be updated when you when

466
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,250
you search for city and protection
Syrian origin protection you will get

467
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,190
this site in one of the first queries
and it's it's simply states this is a

468
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,470
simple trick and it is also the best
solution

469
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,870
create some random long set of an
alphanumeric characters and use that as

470
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:26,630
a subdomain he was an example Justin
hexadecimal value dots domain.com also

471
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,950
banking are in our example and I i
should refer to the last sentence can be

472
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:39,930
guest yes but highly unlikely can it be
linked yes but highly unlikely is a true

473
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,890
so we thought of over it and we found a
couple of ways to overcome this obstacle

474
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:50,110
because that's what we figured that the
most of our clients are doing and I

475
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,670
don't know about most but every time we
approached the city and when we tried to

476
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,600
to find the original one of those two
walked the first thing is to find

477
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,640
another known subdomain of this domain
and then search for animated IOP and

478
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,630
incorporate all the flash 2416 Class B
and Class C to C for another eye peas

479
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:16,120
and then maybe one of them is the domain
now that's pretty massive you have to

480
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,000
work hard in order to find out which
domain is the origin but we have another

481
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,870
drink and the other three kings day who
is service never forget you have louise

482
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,950
is truly in the internet and the
internet never forget that the whole

483
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:34,670
thing and if we try and figure out what
the customer did because them about a

484
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,540
city and then provide the city and with
the origin chances are the teeth didn't

485
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,900
change the origin and IP in the first
place he just changed position from one

486
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,960
to one state to another form single
state to city and state and that

487
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,100
provided him if we are looking at the
history of the DNS records we will find

488
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,430
out the last I P used and maybe just
maybe that's the idea for example of

489
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,500
find out there is one sided doing it for
free but it damaged cited doing it with

490
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,630
with some with small small amount so you
have you DNS detailed info and that you

491
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,390
got in this case I just searched for
some kind of infected animal were

492
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:22,020
infested site named bing.com and through
that we figured just a list of the

493
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,810
history of being dot com we never
attracted of course just for the example

494
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:35,110
number one that's a very common mistake
block him

495
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,480
block them and lock them and lock them
what the customer did and we know it as

496
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,980
a strategy of his customers to block
every idea that is seen as alert many

497
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,640
customers do that because when it's when
they see as it's something that that is

498
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,820
alerting them they are afraid of
something that will happen and just

499
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,380
blocking them whatever will do but
blocking something that is not possible

500
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,790
because it i hav can be considered one
of 1,000,000 bucks a month maybe let's

501
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:08,060
say you just 100,000 100,000 baht so
blocking IP level it's not so smart but

502
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:13,040
what you can do and again it's not much
but you can do is blocking maybe in

503
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,130
class B or C so that exactly what the
customer did in this case the customer

504
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,340
was in Israel so we are talking about
the last numbers than that but

505
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,630
entrenched in france you have 82 million
abused individual IP is provided in

506
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:33,870
ranges and thats sums up to about 10
1200 Class B Rangers and this customer

507
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:39,900
was was providing the exact try to do
that I just described he contacted each

508
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:47,119
class B range that he saw as an alert
and then in israel we have much less

509
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,750
too much less than the Rangers we have
like four million and then like

510
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,800
maybe tenth of the of this kind of the
class so in this case we operated in

511
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,970
Israel and the end it was a very easy
task

512
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:05,200
it it took two minutes not not
demonstrate what's right on the border

513
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,840
it's just a projection for France but
two minutes to block all IP ranges in

514
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,130
Israel so when customers from Israel
which is most of the customers in this

515
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:20,690
case was involved was involved sorry was
involved was unable to access this tight

516
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,530
end just to put a cherry on top

517
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:28,120
the actual team that was monitoring this
site could not exercise because of this

518
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,780
restriction like halfway along the way

519
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:40,560
ok so then collection miss caption
misconceptions there is no magic pill no

520
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,010
best cocktail forget about her to need
to practice practice your people how to

521
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,380
do it is up to you may be on dry runs
maybe on wet ones like this one may be

522
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,040
other kind of awareness program anything
but just practiced jason said it out

523
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,210
loud them saying it again did a subset
of the of Das do not be confused if you

524
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,700
can be dust if you have any availability
in the system and it's it's vulnerable

525
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,580
to enough service you will be done
without hula and and things like the US

526
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,330
now you can have all the toys and money
and awarded will not be sufficient in

527
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:22,380
practice I will repeat that once again
and lasts for this presentation less

528
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,640
advice if you want to that it's a threat
you can be evaluated for this

529
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,850
presentation in the future

530
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,890
okay thank you questions
