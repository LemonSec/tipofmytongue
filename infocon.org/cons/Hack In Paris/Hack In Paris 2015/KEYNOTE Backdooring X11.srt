1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,470
hello everybody my name is what the f

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,630
I'm from Argentina english is not my
first language and it's not your first

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,090
language so if you don't understand
something I said so

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,699
saying I will repeat and I know that I
am the only one keeping you away from

5
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:38,829
food so I'm gonna make a quick talk
about x11 to here knows what excellent

6
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm not talking about the protocol and
talking about the software X Windows

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:53,019
manager from a lot of operating systems
who uses it everyday

8
00:00:53,019 --> 00:01:00,860
show I was playing around with it and it
all came from an idea that I had back in

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,430
1995

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,400
first off I'm gonna talk you invite you
to a conference organized in argentina

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,270
it's at the end of November I don't see
if these not open yet will be in a

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,619
couple of weeks I have a couple of
teachers here to give away I have a

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,800
couple of questions to ask you during
the conference and the person who gives

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,150
the best answer will get a t-shirt and
see if we will open a couple weeks so

15
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:33,979
you're all invited to come so I had an
idea back in 1995 and I was watching a

16
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:41,020
lot of hollywood movies and the main
idea to me

17
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:48,240
doubt that I had was what his worst
moment order most vulnerable moment for

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:59,120
our computers who here has their
computer disk encrypt it ok so when you

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,990
have your computer if the computer is
turned off your safe because see someone

20
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,289
steals your computer it's encrypted so
that's it so what if what happens when

21
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:16,470
the computer is on who is guarding your
information when the computer is on

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,990
I'm asking you what is keeping an
intruder from getting into your

23
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,420
information when your computer is turned
on

24
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,940
ok we have a lot of things like the
operating system we have the encrypted

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,610
volume and the software the managing

26
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,770
LBA whatever and that's it that's the
only problem we have what happens when

27
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,810
we turn on our computer we put the
encryption key in our computer software

28
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,370
and then we start using the computer and
then we lock it to go to the bathroom or

29
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:03,640
whatever what is the only main theme
that is protecting anyone from accessing

30
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,640
your encrypted but already decrypted
temporarily information on your computer

31
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,120
ok we have the upper level of the
operating system which is the the GUI

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,989
and the access to our session we have a
password-protected session or whatever

33
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,980
then we have the software running on on
the bug while we're not going to close

34
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,920
the encryption every time we go to the
bathroom someone does that someone's

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,100
closes the door closed the session the
encrypted session each time they log the

36
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,959
computer even if it's for five minutes

37
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,730
ok some people do but most of us don't i
dont so when I have my computer to turn

38
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,000
on and I have to go away for a minute or
two just lock it and that's it

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,920
so basically the most vulnerable point
in our whole system is when the computer

40
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,560
is locked but already logged in and we
have our password encryption password

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,170
put it into a recession and that's it so
the most most vulnerable situation in

42
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,570
which we can get an intruder to access
our information even the computer is

43
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,570
unlocked if someone right now

44
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,530
grabbed me and someone else takes my
computer which is unlocked and crew

45
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,930
because I have already crippled him
ideas to access my presentation or

46
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,710
whatever and then you can take my
computer operating system is unlocked

47
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:42,000
and that's it so after watching a lot of
movies that people do that I started

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,010
wondering how can I locked my computer
using the card were we we can put a

49
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,090
condition on the computer that if
certain hardware exists on the computer

50
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,660
the computer will stay unlocked but if I
could take down that hard work out the

51
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,430
computer worm wheel lock basic principle
so i turn it down into two steps of

52
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,919
course in 1995 I was only 10 so I didn't
do anything but a couple of years later

53
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:18,590
actually last year I started again with
this research and I basically put it

54
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,900
down to just tips wanted to find a way
to lock the computer and the other one

55
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,050
is fine away to read the device that
will actually do that game of having on

56
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,600
and off and I came back to the most
simple hardware you can connect to a

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,780
computer which is a USB device Yahoo we
have beef I have this USB device plugs

58
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:48,780
computer will stay locked unless of
course I like it but if I take these of

59
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,780
eyes off the computer the computer we
will log even if I'm on it so I didn't

60
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,650
always this number 12 find how to read a
device do we go for the file system and

61
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,979
I didn't like that because the file
system depends on how the operating

62
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,380
system is handling it

63
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,979
you cannot check if the TV devices
connected because anyone can connect

64
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,330
another flash drive and if this one is
not connected then the next one that's

65
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,880
gonna be a sign by the operating system
is going to be as the be so it cannot

66
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,320
work so I went 40 unique identifier we
just an identification and unique to

67
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,639
each piece of hardware almost so when I
did

68
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,669
was quite simple in Linux you have of
course you know Olympics everything is a

69
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:47,169
file whatever anything everything is
represented in a file so you can access

70
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:54,870
pretty much anything you want by axis II
single piece of plain text file so when

71
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,930
you connect the USB Drive or whatever
you get an enrollment into dis

72
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:09,729
/ there / tags / by Ed like a folder is
not a full of it sitting inside in the

73
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,539
identifier so the only thing that I
should do is check the presence of my

74
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:22,150
unique identifier inside diet that
string and check every point one seconds

75
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,569
that would be enough so it's pretty easy
so what about the second step what about

76
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,430
the trigger the lot of the computer and
I thought about the bus who here knows

77
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,120
about the US little people

78
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,979
awesome than I can explain the boss is a
PC software inter-process communication

79
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:51,139
software II provides communication
between the operating system and

80
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:57,339
different applications and also be
joining application to application it's

81
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,370
like the RPC and windows but it's much
better also you can install the bus

82
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:09,080
windows so the bus handles software
handles harder handles changes handles

83
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,669
environment changes each time you
connect to a wifi who you here uses

84
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:22,860
genome you know Linux or Katie Couric's
iam ok each time you connect to your

85
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,370
wifi each time you change your
configuration each time you lower the

86
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,469
volume or mute or pause or whatever the
boss is handling that it has an upper

87
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,529
limit of software which is connected to
the going and to you and then between

88
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,550
that software and the kernel it's the
bus

89
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,089
the GUI talk to the boss says I want to
do this and then the demoss talks to the

90
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:57,820
kernel so it has complete dominance of
over the computer in order to do this of

91
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,390
course it has to run with privileges it
speaks directly to the kernel it doesn't

92
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,089
have to ask for authorizations forum
from anyone anything that you do

93
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,339
anything goes to the bus and the bus
aces ok for instance if it wasn't for

94
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:18,269
Dimas you will never be able to connect
to a wifi if you weren't routes because

95
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,600
you need higher level to change the
configuration of the of the network

96
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,339
adapter Saudi boss does that for you you
cannot turn off your computer if you

97
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,220
weren't doing when you do it when you go
to the corner and hit shut down you're

98
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:41,700
talking to the bus and of course it
available in almost all ex-display

99
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,550
managers so I chose to use the above
because it had fun way of playing with

100
00:09:48,550 --> 00:10:04,430
this I'm gonna show you them to show you
a couple of things that you can do a

101
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:12,390
device you can do printing in a remote
control you change the email you can

102
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,510
change the sound you can change a lot of
information you cannot manually disable

103
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,329
certain parts of the bus it comes as a
whole

104
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,110
either you have it or you don't and if
you don't have the votes you will feel

105
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,560
it because you won't be able to use all
your main features that you're used to

106
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,880
using your computer like meeting decide
whatever we have a lot of information

107
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:47,640
and all this is handled by the show I
have letter

108
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,300
this is all the devices that I have
connected on my computer right now which

109
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,990
of course are all the partitions from my
is the a tour or my main hard drive on

110
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,090
my computer and I'm gonna connect this
and see the difference

111
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:19,040
the change can you read ok I'm going to
run it and now it finds the difference

112
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,970
that has as the B and down the is the
one which is the only partition I have

113
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:33,590
on my device list know the item
identifier files that the operating

114
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:42,850
system has created it for me to access
my device so you can go here and I have

115
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,030
a lot of information

116
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:53,290
oldest comes from my devices for
instance the as the 81 is a Toshiba and

117
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,790
this is part of a serial number and it
is a unique identifier for my own discs

118
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,230
if you have the same disk you will have
a different unique identifier supposedly

119
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,860
like there's not a MAC address is being
repeated we will never know that but

120
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,530
let's try to believe that it's like that
so we have the unique identifier and I'm

121
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:21,980
going to find the unique identifier
floor my flesh right I don't have the

122
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,220
UUID

123
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:30,360
this hard work is not providing it but I
have the by I D which is pretty much ok

124
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,050
if you want to do this right you should
get a piece of hardware that provides

125
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,830
the this line are you can buy up to a
dollar to Euro / arrive and that's it

126
00:12:41,830 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm going to use

127
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:09,930
although most common share we call is my
phone is gonna called the device motion

128
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:17,000
bus object and I'm going to grab the org
dodgy know that screensaver because I'm

129
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,990
using genome but of course you can use
KDE can you see the red yeah you can use

130
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,670
KDE or even used for death or whatever
you use the same child of the same

131
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:34,920
object of course I'm gonna tamper with
this screensaver playing with how the

132
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,970
depots handles a screensaver each time
you lock the computer via the actual

133
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,950
engine that is locking the computer is
the bus go in 10 and save file equals

134
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:57,160
and all this so it's pretty simple

135
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:07,600
if it doesn't exist screensaver lot look
at it that's that's that's how the

136
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:16,100
object works if it's not working if it's
not present that fire and time sleep so

137
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:27,639
I'm gonna try to the computer so the
computer is working and doing everything

138
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:40,639
right and when I take my USB out quite
simple even if I put the password when I

139
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,129
walk but its going to reach not unlocked
but it's gonna be logged in less than a

140
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:49,920
second because it's checking constantly
so if I have this title my wrists and

141
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,939
I'm in a dangerous place outside on the
street whatever I have this with me at

142
00:14:55,939 --> 00:15:01,350
all times and if I'm giving the talk and
someone grabs me from behind and someone

143
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,810
takes my computer and runs off the
computer will lock the USB will pop in

144
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,790
the computer will lock and that's it and
I was very happy that I was able to

145
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:23,430
fulfill my 1995 trying to roll fantasy
and now you can all do it

146
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:29,270
of course you can do a lot of other
things you gonna sound alarm you can

147
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,790
email you some information you can start
the webcam recording so you and

148
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,830
streaming you can get information from
the attacker or the one who stole your

149
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,839
computer you can follow all he can be
leading private keys you can shred the

150
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,760
entire did you can do whatever you want
you can encrypt certain information that

151
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,870
you have right now even if fewer devices
decrypted you can really cripple using

152
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,820
another method without a password that
you have on the computer maybe a private

153
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,950
key whatever encryption files that even
if the access the drive they won't be

154
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,800
able to access those specific files you
can do a lot of things depends on your

155
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,140
imagination but the basic stuff with six
Golden must tell them to lock the

156
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,630
computer if something happens and then
do something else that's it but then I

157
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:29,120
thought can i unlock the computer using
the same method can i play around with

158
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,310
the computer and many played myself when
and where and how the computer will

159
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:43,430
unlock no matter what the users this so
I thought about generating a back door

160
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:51,370
of course I'm looking at computer always
has two steps as last light like locking

161
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:59,560
it we have to find a way to unlock
computer someway somehow and then to set

162
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,309
a trigger to that unlock so we have
control like a backdoor access you'll

163
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,920
know how to walk back door works about
juror is dormant it's on the background

164
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,010
running but not making any noise and
then when the attacker sends specific

165
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,980
trigger reset on the on the back door
the back door will do what the attacker

166
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,390
ones and for a back door to be a good
one it has to have small traces a

167
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,770
definite had to make a lot of noise

168
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,960
memory on the CPU on the death doesn't
have them I have much files and it has

169
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,240
to have still trigger a trigger that is
not very noisy that is not fireworks

170
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,400
something that is in school

171
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:57,210
guns figures or something so I'm looking
at computer leaving small traces to use

172
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,210
binaries no I like it to use rich kids
know i will like it I wanna be more

173
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,140
creative to use operating system
features tell you why not why use

174
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,260
binaries when you can use always
features that are already inside a

175
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,110
computer why care about getting a
computer and leaving a trace or having

176
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:27,030
my cash check on the start by checking
integrity checker whatever I can use

177
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:35,160
operating system features and be done
with it so of course I chose the US has

178
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,660
the option to unlock the computer no
matter what

179
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,160
yes that's true you can use the bus to
unlock the computer when and where you

180
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,320
want numerical password is being set
number of the user no matter of user put

181
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:01,030
the password or not you can unlock it so
a little early second part hilfiger in

182
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,510
order to have a good health trigger we
have to be able to not alert the

183
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:12,130
antivirus course we have to be able to
executed without suspicion and we have

184
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,890
to be able to have that trigger
available in all computers it doesn't

185
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,150
work it does work but it's better if I
have a trigger that it works on PCs on

186
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:29,490
mags in a 1985 computer in a two month
old computer or whatever you have even

187
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,230
on cell phone the better the more
computers I can put into the circle

188
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:43,020
infected or vulnerable hard work the
better so I can put it all on one

189
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,120
so then I thought keystrokes course not

190
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,200
antivirals capture keystrokes like that
you have a keylogger love about open

191
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,870
port know it's very easy for an
antivirus or an IDS you check if you

192
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,050
have an open for that shouldn't be open
and it's very very easy for the user to

193
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:09,840
close it with a feud strokes in like
five seconds so I didn't like that and

194
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,120
remember that I'm trying to do this as
nice as possible like piece of art I

195
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,900
don't want by Norris and I want to be
strokes I want something different

196
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,640
something to be nice and also to work
and I went with her were because I had

197
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,660
such much experience with our were
working with you with the previous

198
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:37,000
project and I said ok let's do it so I
still hardware reader we will not use

199
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,940
any software part we will not use
keystrokes will not use a network

200
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,410
connection we will not use anything we
do software we will use a hundred

201
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:54,180
percent hard work trigger so to use a
hard word trigger the Harvard change the

202
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,040
indication of the Harvard change has to
be responsive when the computer is

203
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,190
locked and that is not very common there
there are many hardware changes that

204
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,580
respond when the computer is locked

205
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:16,100
also the operating system must not
interfere we must not we we cannot wait

206
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,770
for the authorization of the operating
system because that way we can alert and

207
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,500
engine or something that is working with
the operating system and in my trigger

208
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,450
an antivirus or any ideas or whatever so
we have to be able to respond while lot

209
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:40,990
and the operating system has to obey no
matter wat without knowing or without

210
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:49,720
authorizing any type of action and the
last cannot be disrupted and that one is

211
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,730
important because he pretty much the
leading all the other options that I had

212
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,250
thought so far so question for you for
the first three sure what kind of hard

213
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,980
work triggers comply with all these
three it has to respond while locked it

214
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,440
doesn't have to care what the operating
system says about that and it cannot be

215
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:24,179
disrupted that's a question for you like
the mouse keyboard again if we use mouse

216
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:29,260
or keyboard you can be treated by the
antivirus remember the basics off about

217
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,570
a back door is that an antivirus is
constantly looking at that so if we put

218
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:43,280
control backspace enter an antivirus my
catch that so no keyboard screen good

219
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:54,580
who said that what else what what else
power source but that's the three ones

220
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:03,750
that I chose the three ones that I get
are those but two of those don't comply

221
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,490
with the third option is here

222
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,110
network connection know because if it's
handled by the operating system you can

223
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:20,190
configure your computer to not accept
connections unless you specify it like

224
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,150
taking now be automatic India network
connection so you can use screen

225
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:34,940
brightness of the display horse and you
can use power input but it won't be

226
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,169
disruptive

227
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:42,230
you will be disrupted why how is it a
power source change can be disrupted

228
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:48,940
what happens if the laptop is out of
battery you unplug the New York Court in

229
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,130
the computer dies and then you have the
disk encryption came over what happened

230
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,860
with the screen

231
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:02,580
what happens if you have the Falken few
your computer and you close the lid and

232
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,320
you change the brightness because that's
the only way to change the brightness

233
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,110
with a computer is locked the only way
to change anything from the computer

234
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,220
from the screen the computer is locked
in by shutting it down and then the

235
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:23,410
monitor will go off any the computer is
configured to hibernate or powered on

236
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,420
the computer then you're screwed

237
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,220
close the lid and then came over so
what's the one that works it has to be

238
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,419
something that's available in every
computer that its execution it's simple

239
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:42,809
but you don't have to start plugging
things for connecting wires are opening

240
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,799
the computer in have that it's a hundred
percent hard were but if not check or

241
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,220
authorised by the operating system and
it doesn't care about anything and he

242
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,020
can do it if the computer is locked in
the operating system has no chance and

243
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:10,650
fighting God hardware change what I
don't know what

244
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,590
the jack yes the audio jack

245
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:23,600
sure what you should do the audio jack
what is so great about the audio jack

246
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,480
before she doubling every computer all
the computers that are here I i dont

247
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
know about the new mag lebed Chitwan
with the new USB have no idea that has

248
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,050
an audio jack but before that all
computers had an audio jack for the ear

249
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,510
headphones microphone we have the
microphone integrated but for the

250
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:48,380
headphones we have it on all computers
the audio jack has a mechanic detection

251
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,300
it's not about software when you connect
the jack its mckinney the sugar

252
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:02,450
disclosed way before the operating
system has a chance to stop it and of

253
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,990
course it works when the computer is
locked

254
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,680
checking yourself logged computer with
the music from the speakers and then

255
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,500
connect the headphones any will go to
the headphones no matter what you're

256
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,780
doing no matter the computer is locked
or leaders no security feature you can

257
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,850
enable to stop there so I have my
hardware change and on top of that

258
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:28,060
notifies the operating system so I have
my trigger so I have a hard work attack

259
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:35,720
but it's not suspicious oh look someone
in headphone oh my god that the

260
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,180
operating system cannot stop fraud it
will be in the form of that change and

261
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,910
is an antivirus that check that there's
someone here from a company that can see

262
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,510
that they have a product of checks
connection and disconnection from the

263
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,030
audio jack I didn't think so

264
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:04,450
show again just steps we read that file
which includes all the information from

265
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,789
the the

266
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:14,529
the car all information relating to
SunGard is reading and read all the time

267
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:20,850
in that file and it's pretty standard
for all Linux distributions be found

268
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,820
signs euro means that the first sound
card into how different sound cards you

269
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:30,100
will have different numbers but the
basic one is / fraud / a sound card 0

270
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:37,749
and then of course check for changes and
then under jus Jack dog pee idemo and

271
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:45,369
for that I need a super important hurdle
that I need you to borrow river wild

272
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:57,749
does anybody here have a home phone I
can use just a simple head from there is

273
00:27:57,749 --> 00:28:03,440
no try again this one is bigger so you
can see from her thank you I'm going to

274
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,539
use these super amazing hacker tool to
bypass enter 11 and backdoor my way into

275
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,659
my computer and I'm gonna showing right
now just a warning when you start

276
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:18,909
playing with this your computer may be
damaged I damaged my computer playing

277
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:23,529
with this will apply in an employee and
I kind of them and show you what if your

278
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:27,080
gonna play with this and you're gonna
try to replicate this try to do it and

279
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,139
all computer that you are not in love
with like I'm in love with this one so

280
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:44,090
I'm gonna show you this first off

281
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:59,620
and all the information regarding to the
car like the general me boost volume and

282
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:05,000
has all the information regarding that
every control name is a different

283
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,390
setting of my sound card so we have
speaker playbooks which we have a lot of

284
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:17,659
things we have a mixer there's a lot of
features on these sound card that we're

285
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:21,630
not using and of course the better
Sankar will have better features and you

286
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,320
can read all this information to make
your own applications Doug play around

287
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:42,240
we decide so the one that's important to
me is the number fourteen states bigger

288
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:50,590
playback switch so I just did a small
script that reads

289
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:57,289
grapes that part and refreshes it so
it's doing that it's gripping that

290
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:03,399
trigger playback switch something to
connect this and try to find the the

291
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:15,160
change

292
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:23,049
here

293
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,310
the pin

294
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:30,760
the pen regarding this pen will change
from 0 to 40

295
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,400
that's all I need that's a small
hardware change that is available to me

296
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,010
even if the computer is on is locked and
he doesn't care what the operating

297
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:54,640
system says about that racism here's and
that's a small problem and this is for a

298
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:02,010
t-shirt also what if the victim wants to
use the headphones I cannot put the back

299
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:07,020
door to say okay the headphones are on
don't like computer on unlocking what is

300
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,060
the people that the person goes to the
bathroom has the headphones on the

301
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,160
computer will never never lock and then
we're screwed

302
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:21,330
creative how do we solve this problem

303
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,820
pattern yes sir you get a t-shirt I only
bought three sorry I have a lot of

304
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,760
cigarettes if you want to but this is
for answers we create a pattern of

305
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,250
course we create a simple powder that
said checks every one second for

306
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,500
instance you can put it to whatever you
feel faster with your finger you can put

307
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,210
it a second for me for the damage workin
preferred

308
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:51,100
once again so you if you create a
pattern that says 01 110 for instance

309
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,490
disconnected connected connected and
disconnected then you have a trigger so

310
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:02,890
we use device to unlock and we have the
Super haggard and then we have to

311
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:08,170
special secret pattern that will only
you can of course you can make it more

312
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,010
complicated 2011 1000 of course you can
come get it but of course that's not the

313
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:19,730
case with a demo want to make it simple
and on a side note the original pattern

314
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,760
was 01 2010 but after my computer broke
my jaw broke

315
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,880
the computer would do all along 010 10
so the computer one block and ruin

316
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,220
dilemma for me so be careful when you
try this at home and so that's it he

317
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,740
said checks like one second and we do

318
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:54,830
0 remember 0110 and that's a that's
right

319
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:03,659
I'm gonna do this and I'm going to lock
the computer and grab my super hot cute

320
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:20,070
and going to let's count 0 1110

321
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:55,040
don't have i don't have anything for my
long

322
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:06,680
this one will unlock when I close and
reopen my mind computer twice so this is

323
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:12,550
gonna create some problems with the
projector just going to fall back on my

324
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:35,340
put it back and I have here on

325
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:46,480
so how can you stop this you can't sorry
you can remark us if you want to buy you

326
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,220
will find yourself without any of the
features that you are so used to be able

327
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:57,130
to use on your computer like shutting it
down without using sudo or connecting to

328
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,980
the wifi or whatever you should remark
removing device is not nice you can

329
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,290
disable the lock screen if you disable
the luxury you won't be able to lock

330
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,500
your screen and you won't have
screensaver if you go away from your

331
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,380
computer you will have to manually close
all applications and logout of your

332
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,050
session and then reloading when you come
back it's ugly but it works and you can

333
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,030
switch to a minimum

334
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:32,710
XTM like excess CAE or remember now but
all the minimum XTM schedule finding

335
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:38,310
their beyond reno whatever they don't
have the integrated and they handle all

336
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,810
this in a different way so I do have
your to run it beforehand of course

337
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,800
that's what I call a back door can be
persistent of course you can put it in

338
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,460
DRC local and that's it how big is it
will my original one is twenty lines I'm

339
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:00,770
very I i tend to use a lot of lines to
write you can put it in like 15 maybe

340
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:05,180
but of course this is fighting on
anything put a semicolon at the end you

341
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,030
can put it all the only one line and
highlighted wherever you want if we have

342
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:15,110
10 seconds you can back door any Python
script or whatever you want with one

343
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,080
line and then you have a back door
what's so good about it of course he

344
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,940
doesn't doesn't have any uphold that
another nearby no worries it's not

345
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,980
compile its not nothing

346
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,970
strictly by fun everything runs on
Python right now so we're good and it's

347
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,960
virtually undetectable you're gonna have
my email and Twitter account later if

348
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,140
you find a way to the detectives with
the current existence software I've

349
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,630
given this presentation and about five
countries so far and none of the virus

350
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,660
in those countries

351
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:53,220
had a clue even how to start checking
for this without disrupting execution of

352
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,619
computers right now

353
00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:01,299
pop-up terminal open Python and type
importance of us he doesn't check is it

354
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:06,450
doesn't throw any errors you are
vulnerable right now if it says that is

355
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,020
not that doesn't exist any module called
you busting your ok if it's important

356
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:20,119
and that's it can you do its roots yes
you can do it true there's no way to

357
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,690
stop route from being a victim of this
however in the fall

358
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:32,849
Linux distributions roots cannot block
the screen is a security feature brought

359
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:38,220
my ex display manager which is bundled
with any Linux distribution list if you

360
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:45,700
go to if you login as root in your ex ex
session and you try to log your computer

361
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,539
you will not be able to show you by any
chance you have a root user who has

362
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:54,000
configured their session to be able to
log yes you can do it rude but there is

363
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,299
no security feature that prohibit you
from doing this to root users you can do

364
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:06,609
it to route can you do a Windows yes you
can use windy of us or you can use com

365
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:10,390
are BC or D D E which is our
similarities and windows so you can try

366
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:16,369
to temper of them like I tampered with
the bus and of course the last thing you

367
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:22,440
shell shocker yes fuck yes if you find a
computer that is vulnerable to show

368
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,039
showed you can remotely unlock it

369
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:32,279
the CGI annual whatever you are using
for shell shocked he just send us during

370
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:40,420
the show and the computer will unlock so
yeah I'm gonna try see if you can catch

371
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:51,599
that in doing so that's it

372
00:38:51,599 --> 00:39:03,739
question no question wow you are you
understood everything or you didn't

373
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:29,249
understand anything you have a question
yes my question is very basic

374
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:37,029
they have addy sure to only have three
just getting thanks I can tell you one

375
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:43,279
from Argentina who can come to the
conference on November that's right a

376
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,269
lot of people ask me if you can do this

377
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:50,259
into Android I haven't checked with all
the distributions of Android by yes

378
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:57,180
there are similarities into how Android
handles this same goals and functions so

379
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:03,890
I'm not a big Android fine so I haven't
done it so but the basic Linux system

380
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,440
calls are pretty similar so if you
investigate a little bit I'm sure you

381
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,190
you'll be able to do it I have a
question about day you would be yes

382
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:23,249
computer what do you do if you lost your
USB key or if it's going to be stolen so

383
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:28,789
let's get into a laptop you're going
away for a moment for coffee and

384
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:36,369
somebody gonna steal your laptop USB key
and that's pretty fun what you're lis

385
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:43,979
owner of the computer so you can always
live CD disable the USB checker and then

386
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:49,910
rebooted or you can do a live CD to buy
them file and change the unique

387
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,219
identifier join you USB Drive and you
currently own and that's it you can fix

388
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,740
it in five minutes but it's pretty

389
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,360
fun situation when another one has the
key to your computer

390
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:06,119
yeah question

391
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,940
thank you very much
