1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,380
the end the new laws and %um it is your
home

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,540
I

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,890
I will now go to English which is much
easier for me

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,170
how many views this your first time here

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,990
while a lotta newcomers Sastry puts on
an incredible

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,290
show you're going to have a lot of
interesting people to talk to a lot of

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,070
great presentations

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,750
and please we have a lot of sponsors
that have helped out

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,680
to make this all possible this is the
new facility

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,640
what do you think this new facility is
in a great yeah I mean I absolutely love

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,680
it I think this is yeah

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,920
not scared for so without out getting my
we're gonna be running on little

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,880
behind schedule today as you can tell
and that's okay we will try to make up

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,970
some time

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,760
Aug and during the first break and
during lunch time

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,140
keep in mind that around five o'clock

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,549
we will have a debate very hot debate

18
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,340
on vigilantism and strike back

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,650
active defense in cyberspace

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,810
so please make sure your here we will
have

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,860
alcohol for that and make it all the
more interesting

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,729
but I have the honour OVR beginning

23
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,360
this conference and we're going to talk
about something that perhaps is new to

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,900
you

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,960
and

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,159
and I have talked a little bit about it
in the last a couple of months in

27
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,350
mostly in Europe and I'm gonna mess with
your minds a little bit

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,390
on a present an idea a series of ideas

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,890
that may be right they may be wrong

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,450
but whatever hopefully they can give us
a new perspective

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,640
a new view of information security

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,860
because certainly some other things that
we've been doing over the last few years

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,159
have not been working

34
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,890
so let's keep in mind

35
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,519
APT news people were only for hundreds
and hundreds of days

36
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,400
the concept of digital is something that
we live with something that we breathe

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,350
in our world and I wanna change that a
little bit

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,170
and get you to think about the concept

39
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,910
up analog with a few fundamental
concepts that

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,140
why does digital have to be binary

41
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,250
why do we treat security

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,000
as though it's one thing only that its
static where are the measurements a

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,590
security I don't know if there is any
vendors here

44
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,430
but how many times do we get a product
from a vendor that has a

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,549
guarantee love performance that it will
work

46
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,760
not very often if it all

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,440
and we're going to present some ideas I
have stripped out most of the

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,610
mathematics

49
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,799
is that it is things I do would be sides
that are four

50
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,680
5-6 hours long to give you a high-level
view

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,579
so right now securities keeping the good
guys on us

52
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,440
that's about it wrong button

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,560
there legislation and laws about
security

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,680
how do those work for us those work well
all the laws in compliance

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,880
now we're building I O T

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,810
we already have a mass and in the next
10 years we're gonna add

57
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,410
$20 billion $30 billion $40 billion new
devices

58
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,540
on to something that's already broken
something has to change

59
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,860
so I grew up

60
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,500
doing the stuff I was a TV repairman at
five years old which

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,540
was very very easy back in those days

62
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,360
you take everything out with the TV go
to the drugstore

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,910
find out what bro replace it

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,600
and almost anybody could do this but I
had a deficiency

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm colorblind I don't see collar very
well

66
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,630
and as we go through this you're gonna
see how those

67
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,880
influenced my thinking when it comes to

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,450
analog processing and the differences
between

69
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,530
analog and digital I grew up in
rock-and-roll

70
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,680
I was an audio engineer and I worked
with all the great guys did you see the

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
console

72
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,020
on the right there hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,610
analog control devices in

74
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,680
order to make music that's

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,400
thing with the three dials that isn't
analog computer

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,040
from nineteen 62 63

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,290
yet it kinda worked but it was a
different approach

78
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,210
that i'm gonna suggest we start
revisiting again

79
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,070
so analog WTF

80
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,770
and what is it well I don't can you read
those

81
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,470
it's kind of difficult these are some
questions and the slides I will make

82
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,030
them available to everybody

83
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,919
what is at all

84
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,559
is analog always a yes-or-no question

85
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:26,020
one lawyer asks a question did you kill
that person

86
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,529
isn't always a yes or no answer or

87
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,789
is there something that balances when we
look at balance

88
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,259
its analog it's not yes or no

89
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,699
analog mean something very simple

90
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,179
continuously variable changing

91
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,309
all of the time and

92
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:51,719
in the analog world we take digital
signals

93
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,009
and we split smoothing functions on them

94
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,499
to make them look better and ultimately

95
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,939
sound better when you watch a movie

96
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,599
is a data logger digital anybody

97
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:12,249
is an analog or digital 30 frames per
second

98
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:16,059
to digital function that our eyes

99
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:20,509
and our brain processing turned him to
an analog signal

100
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,800
to make it look continuously variable

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,039
when we talk about things like Aspergers
Syndrome he has Aspergers

102
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,039
well there is a spectrum

103
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,050
it's not a yes or a No answer

104
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,499
and I started to approach security with
the same kind of approach

105
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:44,860
trying to look at it and see are there
new answers that we can come up with

106
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,969
if we just look at the universe
completely differently

107
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,079
I also have a thing called sinners

108
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,839
feature and when I was in the record
business

109
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,709
ice so long music so we were recording
concerts or recording an album in the

110
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:02,419
studio

111
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,769
I would see collars and this is often
the kinda image that I would see

112
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:10,210
while we were making the music and

113
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,540
it some help helped me do it and can
also suggest that the

114
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,530
internet has become analog when we look
at one end point that might be digital

115
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,010
might be binary but be Internet as a
whole

116
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,680
including was coming with I O T it's a

117
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,830
constantly changing blog

118
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,830
do we really have perimeters anymore

119
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,320
that we can say hard to find the digital

120
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,350
points and I'm arguing that when we

121
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,040
step back and look at large networks
look at how everything is connected that

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
it is really much more than

123
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,940
an award function when we want to think
about

124
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,630
how to make things different than they
are now the brain is analog

125
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,230
the brain is not big computer the brain

126
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,520
is a great averaging machine

127
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,010
it averages every phone when you see
something in your looking and it's very

128
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,420
very clear

129
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,340
less than three percent all your brain
and your

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,660
I are used to do the focus everything
else is fuzzy

131
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,919
but the brain average is this

132
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,260
and we're treating the world how do we

133
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,760
interface with that from a human
standpoint

134
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,900
so now we're getting the bio implants

135
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,270
and the prosthetics norrell implants

136
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,560
where we have to connect the digital
world

137
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,880
that were growing up in and we now know
with the analog

138
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,320
human element and more and more of this
is coming I think

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,910
deal on mars is leading now saying we
have to be very very careful how we

140
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,020
become

141
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,610
the board as we put all these things
together

142
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,730
so let's step back and see how did we
get into this mess that we're in right

143
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,430
now

144
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,500
and the fundamental security model

145
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,339
that we use two day was developed

146
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,610
in the nineteen seventies we still use
it

147
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,329
and it was based upon mainframe
computers

148
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:28,230
and the mainframe computers had a box
one wire

149
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,639
and a green screen and that's how we did
security

150
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,709
security was done with a static mindset
because the military are the ones who

151
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,540
developed it

152
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,470
so when we look at military history the
match in a line

153
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,230
did not work the Great Wall of China did
not work

154
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,529
Berlin Wall anything that is a static
defence

155
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:57,850
in the military world has never worked
but that's how we chose

156
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,579
forty-some years ago to actually build
security

157
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,000
into our computing infrastructures such
as they work

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,819
and it's based upon the concept of risk
avoids

159
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,870
I want no rest so the concept was

160
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,000
bill the walls higher and that'll keep
the bad guys out

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,009
in what we do today we say let's add
more firewalls more controls more

162
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,050
defensive technology news

163
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,490
and that'll keep the bad guys out that
works right

164
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,529
week month you are getting to know from

165
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:36,399
everybody here this is what we have
chosen to do

166
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,810
and the fundamental mechanism is called
the reference monitor

167
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,600
and there were several people involved
in development up

168
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,620
Anderson BB bellum a partial back in the
seventies and it was very simple 11

169
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,439
directional communication called a
synchronous

170
00:10:55,439 --> 00:11:00,220
and what we did is a system request for
comment

171
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,720
stop the process go to the side

172
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,459
make a decision come back and I had a
yes or no answer

173
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,249
a binary answer now this worked

174
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:16,889
in a mainframe environment what

175
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,740
killed at all the concept of network

176
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,869
because the network is synchronous it
goes in two directions

177
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:29,619
and this wasn't a synchronous model the
only worked in one direction

178
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:34,519
yet we have stuck with this model
because we started building technologies

179
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,610
around a concept and that's why

180
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,399
every vendor today has a next generation

181
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,850
thing that is really gonna picture
problems

182
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,470
where stock in this mindset

183
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,869
so numbered years ago

184
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,929
a friend of mine who will be in the
debate hopefully this evening

185
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:00,059
gave me an idea I started working with
and it was called protect the tech

186
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,119
respond and he developed for the %um

187
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:07,689
United States Department of Defense so
what are the questions that we began

188
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:09,139
with his here's a fault

189
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:12,559
is that vault secure

190
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,550
is it secure jason is that ball secure

191
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,720
know why not because the doors open

192
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,449
if the doors closed as the vault secured
Jason

193
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:33,329
no why not he's gonna get somebody
that's get the combination

194
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,139
so he's gonna do the social engineering
thing but technically

195
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:42,589
in the physical world we have something
we do something for security

196
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,319
we don't do in our world Jer a safe

197
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:52,459
a vault has a raiding and the rating is

198
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:58,480
temperature and time-based how long will
that metal sustain

199
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,449
a torch trying to break through it so
when you ask your vendor

200
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,980
your firewall looks

201
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,680
really nice how many hours will it
protect me against the Chinese

202
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,279
are you gonna get an answer

203
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,529
in the physical world we have the answer

204
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,810
but in our world we don't have it yet
and I'm gonna are you it's about time

205
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,540
and we're going to use time throughout
and time

206
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,810
isn't analog function it's continuously
variable

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,730
until you get them to quantum mechanics
and we're not gonna do quantum mechanics

208
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,449
here today

209
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,610
all about time so we can

210
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,880
radar firewall nobody knows all the
vendors

211
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,449
law I no offense to vendors or
supporters

212
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,620
course but that's what sales and
marketing guys do

213
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,740
ours is the best ours is the best but
they all operate on the same fundamental

214
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,639
principle

215
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,260
when we look at firewalls and access
control mechanisms

216
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,190
mechanisms and protection devices
ultimately

217
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,300
do the bad guys go through the front
door trying to be did

218
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,459
they do what was done around the
National I'm

219
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,139
to go around it the go over us

220
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:23,360
building under a protection devices is
where we have invested

221
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,870
invested hundreds of billions of dollars
in the last 25 years

222
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,690
and it doesn't work for all of these
sorts reasons

223
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,990
so we need to take another approach what
can we actually measure

224
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,779
internet works and what we can measure
are two things

225
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,800
one is detection

226
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,920
and a detection could be a in the
physical world

227
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,290
Osama alarm are

228
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,130
you it could be are the tape on a window

229
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,050
noticing that the glass has been broken
we know how to measure

230
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,120
be amount of time it takes

231
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,220
to be able to detect something I know a
lot of folks and I don't know if any

232
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,410
have you have

233
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,470
actually built in ones and cold in your
networks

234
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,379
hostile cold is a test the sea

235
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,329
number one can your detection mechanisms
pick it up at number two

236
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,660
how long does it take a but the texan's
only half the battle

237
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,600
we have to be able to react and in the
physical world

238
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,439
maybe a jewelry store is getting rocked
the alarm

239
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:42,300
goes off right away very very very
quickly how long does it take police to

240
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,889
show up to actually

241
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,230
do something we can measure that

242
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,519
in a new york networks you have the same
capability

243
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,279
depending upon how your reaction 28
detection works

244
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,509
do send somebody email they get an SMS

245
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:05,249
they get a telephone call what if the
guy is on holiday

246
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:09,309
what if it's the weekend other five
people to react

247
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:13,740
how long does it take you have the
capability

248
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,050
right now to be able to do some very
simple code

249
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,559
and test your own networks to begin to
get a matter

250
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,589
a measurement love how secure you are
never going to get a little more refined

251
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,019
amiss

252
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,550
and ultimately what happens I'm not
gonna go crazy math with you

253
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,220
is it turns out that we can measure

254
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,230
and quantify security with a simple
formula if

255
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,879
my firewall for example is strong enough

256
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,300
to be able to take somebody hacking

257
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,819
but bad amount of time is greater than
the amount of time it takes

258
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,949
my detection and reaction mechanisms

259
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,540
to find out what's going on and do
something about it

260
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,120
I then can have a secure environment and
I music exclusively

261
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,959
the time domain to be able to do this

262
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,780
so this is something you can do right
now to find out

263
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,209
where you are because something very
interesting happens

264
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,799
in the cold war we did exactly the same
thing

265
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,160
if United States

266
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,740
or allies detected in the cold war

267
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,270
a soviet missile launch we had

268
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,910
eighteen and a half minutes to make a
decision

269
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,080
as to whether the shoot back or not a
time base function

270
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,510
in the physical world which gives us a
lot I hope for what we're trying to do

271
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,460
in our world so when we're looking at
our detection reaction

272
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,169
there's little components other that
mean work in one way if you have a

273
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,890
manual operation with a human has to get
involved

274
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,080
or even go much faster

275
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,940
if you haven't automated process because
you have planned out

276
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,140
things in advance and my experience

277
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,330
the number of companies that have
actually planned out responses to

278
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,240
security

279
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,440
he vents are very very rare

280
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,510
they like to call in the lawyers they
like to call in the police the wanna

281
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,710
call in management to make a decision

282
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,130
which makes the detection time in
reaction time

283
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,910
much bigger which means that my
protection

284
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,040
metric is bad much

285
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,290
smaller some very very simple concepts
that were gonna play with but with this

286
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,040
gives you

287
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,570
is an opportunity to measure your
exposure time

288
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,960
the exposure time what is your detection
time plus your reaction time

289
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,830
because we know the protection cannot be
measured

290
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,049
so we put on a risk management had

291
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:03,470
and look at it that way and then we can
do some

292
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:08,950
math and let the guys overnight and
security but the coroner's the financial

293
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,559
people

294
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,880
you can now we go home

295
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,850
measure your network and determine your
exposure time to find out

296
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,929
how much damage could be done in five
minutes ten minutes to hours

297
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,540
or in cases

298
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,540
China and the PT's four hundred days

299
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,890
six hundred days we are missing the
entire point of work

300
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,770
protection really means and part of the
problem is obviously people do not know

301
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,680
what they have on their networks

302
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,830
and we tend to look at our networks is
one the single

303
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,810
being that all briefing wonder the hood
past

304
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,270
to be protected everything has to be
protected

305
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,070
because that's the technology that we
have been given thus far to be able to

306
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,690
use

307
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,450
but is it everything above the same
value

308
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,160
within your network and obviously it's
not some things are much much more

309
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,350
important than others

310
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,560
but we're still seeing the same security
problems

311
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,880
regardless of how sensitive but data may
be

312
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,840
now we can also apply the concert though
defense in depth

313
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,300
with the simple concept we go to the
movies in which to the big house on the

314
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,730
hill

315
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:29,410
and the bad guys are going to rob so as
they wanna robbing notice that their

316
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,150
views

317
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,580
alarm system so what do they do

318
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,740
they wanted disconnect the alarm system
obviously

319
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,770
however with defense in depth

320
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,940
using this model I can add an additional
layer of protection and detection and

321
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,740
reaction

322
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,470
to me the primary detection mechanisms

323
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,540
which will give us increased levels of
protection

324
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,260
with some defense and a but I am not at
all convinced any more than I believe in

325
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,170
defense in depth and I'm gonna show you

326
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,120
how that works out and why the things
you can do with the exposure time

327
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,240
is to determine the file size is that
could be

328
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,470
actually targeted and it's fairly simple
math to figure out

329
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,880
where's my weakness what is susceptible

330
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,120
and with padding solutions with

331
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,490
adding additional bits and bytes two
files

332
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,690
through obfuscation I love them

333
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,240
to encryption et cetera we convince a
certain files have a higher level

334
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,710
probability up being attacked

335
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,180
being actual traded and then we can
start mitigating in handling this

336
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,850
in a slightly different way but this is
only the very beginning

337
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,300
where we go the circularly

338
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,320
top there is an analog circuit that

339
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,890
dim the light bulb at all it does very
very simple sir

340
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,130
but what we don't do

341
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,160
is how come we don't dim

342
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,400
all the data when we noticed something
we have the ability

343
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,690
current to add what is called a band
with limiter

344
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,059
so simple Analog concept that came from
the music industry

345
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,330
that we can apply to when

346
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,510
in the band is occurring cuz pet we tend
to these days say

347
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,280
something's bad happening turn it off
then we'll fix it

348
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,380
i'm saying there's a middle ground

349
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,970
by dimming the amount of data and again
at a time

350
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,730
base function analog function and
something really interesting happens

351
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,910
and hopefully you can read some about
that have I restrict the band with my

352
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,929
band which is normally one gigabyte

353
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:52,430
and I sense something going on through
the detection mechanism

354
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,260
but I don't wanna shut down my company I
don't wanna shut down accounting I don't

355
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,590
wanna shut down

356
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,460
my transactions what about band with
construction

357
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,740
the numbers turn out very very
interesting with a little bit a bad with

358
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,690
construction

359
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,170
my exposure time will remain the same

360
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,550
but Mike data exposure will go down

361
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,090
orders %uh magnitude with a simple

362
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,310
instead of turning it on and off just
restricting the amount of data that goes

363
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,930
through

364
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,330
now the bad guys no map these guys are
not getting its

365
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,690
may understand just as well as we do

366
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,240
just because they work for the bad guys
doesn't mean they're idiots

367
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,910
but they're also understanding that some
was a lotta math that's coming up and we

368
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,850
are redefining what security is so

369
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,880
one of the things that really bothers me
in our technologies today

370
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,210
is the concept of loot anybody hate
group controls much as me

371
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,430
and getting some head the room its one
person

372
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,430
withhold all binary control

373
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,790
over a system one person wonders

374
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,850
and I have a problem with that and
whether you look at this

375
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,130
note in a van to look at them insider
gone bad

376
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,789
and administrator overriding a man

377
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,070
manager whatever it is route control
gives us

378
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,850
how do we get reserve route all right
now

379
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,080
little billion algebra right now we have
multiple administrators and single

380
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,269
processes which after because one
person's

381
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,239
not gonna work 24/7 so we end up

382
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:40,229
with the Boolean or and the bullion or
says

383
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:44,720
either administrator a or be can do
whatever it is

384
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,450
this is the way we do things now

385
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,739
now when we have multiple administrators

386
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:55,570
having access to Route what happens
store security

387
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,769
years ago up or down it goes

388
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,889
down and there's a lot again math fell
far be happy to share all the map with

389
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:03,570
everybody

390
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,559
the security goes down significantly and
we use probabilistic

391
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,450
amassed simple calculus to do it to
determine the hard numbers

392
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,129
so this is where we are today and

393
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,820
we know it doesn't work in the
enterprise how many are there

394
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,359
I don't know the there's a plunge in
every companies gonna be slightly

395
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:24,940
different

396
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,279
so this comes into the factor of trust
him we're gonna look across the little

397
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,080
bit more

398
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,320
because currently we have a trusted
employee

399
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,070
but when you have a trusted employee do
you trust him

400
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,950
100 percent again a binary function that
word

401
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,099
using I trust him I don't trust him so I
give him

402
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,960
complete control or no control how do we
begin to solve this

403
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,970
well in a safety deposit box to use a
thing called a two-man rule

404
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,899
to different people with two different
keys after unlock

405
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,349
the contest and the two men rule works
pretty well

406
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:13,159
well now for a logic standpoint the two
men rule

407
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,610
isn't and Kate in Boolean speak and on
the topic

408
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,840
Rovers two levels of control

409
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,390
so in this case both administrator a

410
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,360
and administrator be have to both
approved whatever

411
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,750
the action is and it doesn't have to be
that mean it could be

412
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,030
anywhere from hold his work at the cold
level all the way up to BGP

413
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,830
the problem with this though is time

414
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,559
because while administrator a may say

415
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,760
okay I want this done administrator be
maybe out the launch he may be on

416
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,090
vacation he may not agree

417
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,100
there may be a dispute am

418
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,260
suddenly be attempted

419
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,429
make control change is not a fight it
does not work

420
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:08,750
so we have to find a way around this so
this gets back into trust trusting your

421
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,549
partner

422
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:16,929
you trust your partner with your life do
you trust your partner to write a check

423
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,010
without your approval banks use this as
well

424
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,250
the two men rule for fun major financial
services

425
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,850
and this is the world we live in today
so how do we getting around this by

426
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,480
looking at ross factors

427
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,770
currently most

428
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,080
human resources and hiring departments
and managers

429
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,419
do not use a matrix to look at how

430
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,580
trustworthy is somebody and this becomes
very important

431
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,520
when they're hiring if your gonna hire
somebody who is going to do some

432
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,850
really deep deep analytical holding but
he may not have access

433
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,429
to administrative controls does the

434
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,940
he need the same level of trust in the
system is somebody else

435
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,600
again we look at a binary yes or no

436
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,870
with out coming up with some of these
numbers

437
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,990
and these numbers can change throughout
the life cycle

438
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,040
that's why we had Robert Hansen and
aldridge ames

439
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,480
spies in the United States because being

440
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,690
security services in the FBI and the CIA

441
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,090
never really checked these guys as to
why they were spending millions of

442
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,850
dollars

443
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,580
so again they approached it from a
binary

444
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,980
static standpoint with no change at all

445
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,590
now we're gonna introduce a nother
concept before we start gluing this

446
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,340
together

447
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,290
and it's called feedback and in the
military its Colby Lulu

448
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,190
very simple observed koreans

449
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,720
make a decision and then

450
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,010
act and this was developed by Colonel
John Boyd in the nineteen eighties in

451
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,070
the United States

452
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,540
and it was done for aerial combat

453
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,810
the same thing applies to marketing

454
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,110
and sales I have a product idea

455
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,540
I'm in a test that out I'm gonna make a
decision to make

456
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,610
blue widgets and then I'm going to

457
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,990
really observe look again see how the
market likes

458
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,390
and changer and we call it squeezing the
loop

459
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,740
work I want that loop time

460
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,660
to shrink can get very very very very
small

461
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,840
the same way that I want my detection
time

462
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,120
and my reaction time to get very very
small

463
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,570
and in calculus terms it all this is is
a

464
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,250
limit function very very simple to be
able to work with

465
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,990
soul to squeeze the loop with what ever
process I'm doing

466
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,180
and if you want to apply defense in
depth concepts

467
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,350
there are some links that can be applied

468
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,870
and this is where it gets very
interesting with fractal analysis

469
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,880
and understanding the dimensions a pure
networks in again I'll help you with the

470
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,040
matter later on

471
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,670
now feedback is inherently analog

472
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,170
in the world I grew up in on the upper
left we've all heard squeals

473
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,440
when the microphone on the speakers in

474
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,600
any its feedback the device on the right

475
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,059
that as a mechanical governor to control
and regulate

476
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:36,490
the speed have been injured in this case
from steam engine from the 18th century

477
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,289
in the lower left it's an electrical
circuit

478
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,169
the fundamental circuit for all

479
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:48,090
analog circuits is negative feedback
controlled

480
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,190
in order to keep things from going what
we call

481
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,429
a runaway condition where things get
chaotic

482
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:59,440
when they do lose complete control

483
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,600
love the system sounds like

484
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,759
vigils networks that we're living in
today but in the analog world we solved

485
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,240
many many many years ago back in the
nineteen twenties

486
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,779
ICS industrial control systems

487
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,389
many of them users are sure how that
works in a little bit

488
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:22,340
the other component of feedback is
haptics

489
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,059
and we hear the new phones to that blows

490
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,610
their tactical you get it keyboard
Eagles click

491
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,500
you feel it on the new smartphones
sometimes they'll

492
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,740
vibrate a little too let you know what's
going on

493
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,730
we as humans require feedback and was
built into

494
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,820
every aspect nature builds and

495
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,899
every industrial control system every
piece 'em

496
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:50,549
analog electronics on the earth and it
works

497
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:54,139
but we don't do within networks

498
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:57,789
we don't do it in our world at all so

499
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:02,220
what we're gonna do here's take a very
simple example in this case

500
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,330
are we're gonna people use a password
forgot login

501
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,730
to something in all I'm saying at this
point is let's introduce

502
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,990
and analog feedback Lubinda my digital
processing so when

503
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,259
I make a decision I taken action whether
it's again a cold level administrative

504
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,529
level doesn't matter

505
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:29,379
all I'm doing is starting a flock a Mac
clock could be

506
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:32,459
3 milliseconds 3 microseconds

507
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:36,319
two days it doesn't matter it's a
decision

508
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,689
that has to be designed into the system
how long

509
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:46,939
do I require the time to be be four
somebody else

510
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:51,179
actually approves that primary control
choice

511
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,129
and this is the first step of making all
analog work in this case

512
00:32:56,129 --> 00:32:59,139
we've got administrator a making a
decision

513
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:03,319
in the construction of the system
they've said a number

514
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,649
to be one hour where administrator be

515
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:11,199
tax to finally made the approval if he
does not do the approval

516
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:15,289
the original decision is taken back

517
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,229
and completely rescinded so

518
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:22,339
when we move this forward even into

519
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:26,289
greater levels we can do this at the
access control level we can do with the

520
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,549
cold choice level

521
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:33,629
we can do it in virtually any
environment now so you may notice in the

522
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:34,499
physical world

523
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:38,139
you go to your office open the door

524
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:45,359
but you have a security system see if
the 1 like hell to the closet open the

525
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:45,999
door and

526
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:50,179
entering the code within 30 seconds
perhaps

527
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,869
again we do it in the physical world

528
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:59,319
we know that it works but we don't do in
our world yet in all we're trying to do

529
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,989
is the look at it from perhaps an eye in
a mechanism standpoint it's the exactly

530
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,109
the same process

531
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:09,029
any access control mechanism will do the
same phone

532
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:12,029
and what we do is take this

533
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:15,619
and apply a fundamental did now the
fundamental bit

534
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:18,829
unit im Boolean logic

535
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:23,119
and indeed Electronix is how do I store
one believe information

536
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,119
either a0 or one the way it's done is to
the circus and it's called

537
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,340
are s flip-flop and there is the logic
tables for how it

538
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,570
works and very very simple concept ice

539
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,740
admin a zip-top he does the reset

540
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,430
or admin be can do with that and it
changes the output

541
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:49,300
digital this is the way we're doing
things right now

542
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,630
but why do if I take that same circuit

543
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:58,390
and I play a feedback loop that analog
to it what do I have

544
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,050
behind now have a new set of truth
tables serve truth tables that are

545
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:09,590
digital logic with the time base
component to it that it can be preset

546
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,850
in any environment we're living we're
dealing with in our digital world

547
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,580
that's the logic symbol for

548
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,960
that has been developed and there's the
truth tables for that gives us more

549
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,100
conditions and we had before because
certainly looked a little more complex

550
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,279
but all the enabling of this

551
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,310
is just part of setting up the risk

552
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,800
that you're willing to have in your
network based upon

553
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,200
exposure time and your detection and
reaction from

554
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,620
early on now how do we launch a new
again something we've been very used to

555
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,220
in many countries over the years and as
the two men rule

556
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,220
the circuit for the two men rule and how
that works

557
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,580
is this it's very very simple and
supplying how much do I trust

558
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,000
administrator a forces administrator be

559
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,330
to initiate a launch sequence

560
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,790
before the second guy can go yes I
approval no I don't approve

561
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,200
this is the fundamental circuits that
will

562
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,470
do this and we're having it coated now
and we're going to be giving it away for

563
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,040
free

564
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,770
for any woody to be able to apply for us
the next thing I want to do is a ticket

565
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,790
concept we used in the audio world

566
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,570
when digital audio began in the nineteen
seventies

567
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:38,000
traditionally as you saw on that earlier
circuit i'd have a volume control that

568
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,770
is correct

569
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:44,570
we in the circuit that matches what we
do today with TCP IP

570
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,830
my single level of communication the
TCPIP channel

571
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,830
goes over one physical transport level

572
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,060
and that same communication channel is
synchronous

573
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,150
but it has both data and the control
signal

574
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,760
back in the seventies we realized that
we already a world that's not gonna work

575
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,320
anymore when we're doing automation

576
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,410
so what we created was 'em our room

577
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,770
band mechanism to be able to very

578
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,600
the amount of signal that went through
any particular circuit

579
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,470
and an award function part of the great
part that occurs here

580
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,520
is that if my data

581
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,720
might audio signal dies okay I have lost
my audio

582
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,990
have lost my data that's fine bustle of
my control

583
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,790
if I lose my control signal because

584
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,980
is a fixed I would have banned control
into that circuit

585
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,300
I will not go into chaos it will remain

586
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,770
the same will not change until the
control signal

587
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,670
has come up and this is talking about
going

588
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,690
out-of-band Hanway get outer bands
circuitry to be able to work

589
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,550
and communicate where I don't have to
rely upon the TCPIP channel

590
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:12,610
to Dubai detection and reaction a
specially when we have hostile bad guys

591
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,850
wielding a de dos the tax somebody's

592
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,170
Aug major level defense that are
occurring

593
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:24,110
how do i do something about this well we
want to have

594
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:30,020
sometime based escalation and what you
notice in this very simple network here

595
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,830
is that there's some routing channels
but then you notice

596
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,710
there's a lot of sensors lotta sensors

597
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,870
anybody know how many sensors are

598
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:46,160
inside of a jet engine today

599
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,260
about 4,000

600
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,580
four thousand of them but

601
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,190
generate constant feedback i've
information

602
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,680
and generate between one and two
terabytes love

603
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,980
data sensor-based engine performance
data

604
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,710
every hour we keep the planes flying

605
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,150
using a very simple analog feedback
technique

606
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,580
and we use a concept that I said I
disagree

607
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,880
more and more with the concept the
defense in depth I am getting very

608
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,690
impressed with the idea of

609
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,510
detection in Dept we need

610
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,590
Bowl load more sensors in our networks

611
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,020
at all levels a all layers of the stack

612
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,510
all the way down and all the way up
through everything we're doing

613
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,120
and insight about the occasions as well
but order to do that as I mentioned

614
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,880
earlier we have to have a reaction

615
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,770
we have to know what we're doing if this
is gonna work

616
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:52,050
people have to be willing to plan out
and understand

617
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,430
how bad things can be and what should
occur

618
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,830
if we don't take this step and we allow
management to continue doing it the way

619
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,690
it's being done today we're going to
continue to fail

620
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,430
so there's lots of small elements to
make this all work we have a single

621
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,520
reaction channel

622
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,770
that's certainly possible we've got

623
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:18,380
detection and depth with multiple
reaction channels the same kind concept

624
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,410
and we take the same out a bank on Sep

625
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,560
and let's say we're doing this at BGP if
the ISP level

626
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,930
creating a out-of-band network

627
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,450
just for security just for security

628
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,630
will allow less than 2 have ISP's

629
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,800
talking to their peers in its peer to
peer conversations are not that many of

630
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,270
them

631
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,280
and be able to do honest to god

632
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,460
hacking back to the source and
mitigation

633
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,290
I love spam and hostile attacks at the
slow

634
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,480
it looks fundamentally like this I've
got my primary channel

635
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,590
data communication I'm using TCP API can
use it as a control signal

636
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,670
but when something goes wrong each one
of those points at the sensors

637
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,460
is gonna need to have a texan module

638
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,940
reaction module and then back to

639
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,430
but back-channel communication to out a
band

640
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,470
the other thing that we can do with our
circuits is something that back in my

641
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,250
day

642
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:29,270
we called negative time what if I
introduce a negative time

643
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,840
into some of my circuits when decisions
are being made

644
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,950
the negative time factor there's the
schematics for

645
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,410
these are not things that have to be
invented that these are things that have

646
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:41,870
to be

647
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,010
re fought and it's called introducing

648
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,410
intentional the ladies in the circuits

649
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,650
a few nanoseconds for the processing and
decision-making to be done

650
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,110
because if I know my detection and I
know my reaction time

651
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:03,120
that becomes exposure time if my
exposure time

652
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,740
is very very small because I've done it
right and I

653
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,030
had a little bit of negative time delay

654
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,770
what happens mathematically provable
security

655
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,270
mathematically provable security

656
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:23,630
and I'm very very much enjoyed being
able to talk to any view about this over

657
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,080
the next couple of days

658
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,960
the thing that reason I put this up the
math that's here

659
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,670
is very very close to the matter that
we've developed and

660
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,060
this is math for load balancing on
existing circuits are already doing

661
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:42,840
we do this for load balancing we do it
for traffic stability

662
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,610
in order to avoid chaos on certain or
circuits

663
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:53,190
we already have it we have just never
looked at it from a pure security stamp

664
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,109
so analog network security for me has
been an eye-opener

665
00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:00,580
it allows me to look at the world in a
wholly different way

666
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,820
every time I have a discussion with
somebody I don't know what about the

667
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,960
time factor

668
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,109
what about time how was that he fit into
the equation

669
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:12,050
is up automatically brings in an an
award function

670
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,790
and not any longer looking for a purely
by Mary answer

671
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,420
these are the tenets these are the rules

672
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,849
these are the fundamental pieces though
I find to be exceedingly valuable

673
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:29,300
and I know that in 45 minutes I have not
done this justice

674
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:35,170
but I hope to have got you think maybe a
little bit that looking at the world in

675
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,040
a completely different way than we have
in the past

676
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,310
will offer us something up a path
forward

677
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,160
and I really hope to have an opportunity
to speak with the many have you

678
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,240
and for you to challenge me and for us
to discuss

679
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,750
how well some of these may work so I
want to thank you very much

680
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,920
welcome to hack in Paris and but all
have a ball this week
