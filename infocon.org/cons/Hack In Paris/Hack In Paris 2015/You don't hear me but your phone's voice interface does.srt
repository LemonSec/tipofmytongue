1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,039
ok good morning everybody we are

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,460
syllabuses Davison joke against me and
we are going for the during the next 40

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,609
minutes to present you the research we
did on the electric man nicht ich

4
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,120
threats on information systems that
resulted in a new interesting technique

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,860
for silently and remotely injecting

6
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:48,100
voice commands on smartphones so we are
20 basis and my friend jackie gets me we

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,910
work with the French Network Information
Security Agency in the wireless security

8
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:01,120
level and our main research topics are
electromagnetic threads on information

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,150
systems radio communications security
embedded systems as well as

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:17,790
signal processing so the menu for today
I will start by briefly introducing the

11
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,970
voice command interpreters on the phones
in the desktop computers and then we

12
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:30,950
will resent the attack technique that we
used for interfacing ourselves with the

13
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:38,010
smartphones remotely then I will
describe some some attack scenarios and

14
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:49,710
the related countermeasures so the voice
command I will start with a redefinition

15
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,290
and then I will sum up some available
commands interface

16
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,909
I will

17
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,819
speak about the activation conditions
and described the whole processing and

18
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:11,209
then we'll finish with a brief summary
of the previous work on the security so

19
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,709
the voice command interface

20
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:21,090
sensory user interface that allows the
user to interact with electronic devices

21
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:28,379
my voice and this interface is getting
more and more deployed on many kinds of

22
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,840
devices such as smart phones smart
watches

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,940
the Internet of Things

24
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:45,210
you can also find voice command in cars
and on the desktop computers and it's

25
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,100
getting more and more deployed

26
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:55,560
all the major West editors provide their
own solution so able developed serious

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,510
and voice control

28
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:07,110
previously Microsoft has gotten a Google
developed Google Voice Search and

29
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,840
the phone manufacturers that like to add

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,280
for proprietary later on double venturi

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,950
develop their own solutions here for
example it's something and solutions

32
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:30,670
gold s voice so what can you do my voice
on smartphones you can control and

33
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,450
trigger lot of services so of course you
can use it telephony services you can

34
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,069
place calls send text messages

35
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,319
you can also access to a bunch of
Internet services you can do web

36
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,829
browsing you can send emails publish to
social networks and of course you can do

37
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:58,469
some web searches and use navigation and
maps and so on and the user can also

38
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,790
access to look at services such as

39
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,880
setting alarms

40
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:13,810
creating new calendar events or
applications and also sometimes

41
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:26,320
depending on the solution you can also
change settings so when the voice

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,220
interpreters are always activated

43
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,169
the user just has to pronounce sexy word
and then

44
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:41,189
you can say that the commander wants to
see executive on the phone when its not

45
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,529
the case

46
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:49,449
you can launch the application by the
aforementioned applications or you can

47
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:55,429
also enable the voice command
interpreter by pressing hard button so

48
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,270
for example you can use the home button

49
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,150
iPhones and more interestingly you can
also use

50
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:14,970
the main button on the remote of the
headset when device interpreter is

51
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:22,750
activated then the processes or can be
done by to me the first

52
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,560
is local so the keyword detection is
made locally on the phone and sometimes

53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,920
you can also access to limited actions
on the phone directly but for the vast

54
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,390
majority of the commands you need to
have an internet access because the

55
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:48,130
voice processing in the community rating
is interpretation is made on cloud

56
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:55,040
services so here we can see three main
path for interacting with the voice

57
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,529
command interpreters the first one is
the network's I

58
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:05,629
the second one is from the phone we can
you imagine that an application would

59
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:11,739
interact with her on the phone for
example and the third one in your front

60
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:27,239
end and in this study we focused on the
third one front and on the voice command

61
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:32,969
interpreter security there has been a
lot of articles about bypassing

62
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:37,220
authentication the lockscreen
identification by using

63
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:45,580
series some people a few years ago

64
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,420
did some reverse engineering of the

65
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,610
the

66
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:56,189
communication protocol between the
cloud-based service and the phone and

67
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:03,159
there is the voice processing side that
is also critical because its biometric

68
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:11,220
data users voice and recently able

69
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,610
claimed already disclosed that they
share the voice samples with third party

70
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:27,600
companies so this thread for the user's
privacy and finally some researchers

71
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:36,540
published local attacks they used
malicious application that will enable

72
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:43,000
the device command interpreter and then
we'll send commands by

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,610
through the front end so they play the
sound of the command

74
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,310
speaker and the

75
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,300
device command interpreter

76
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:03,629
catches it from the front so in this
attack the user

77
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:12,400
here's everything and today we are going
to present a new way another way to

78
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,819
interact with the voice command
interpreter and we will use a smart

79
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:22,760
intentional electromagnetic
interferences to inject

80
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,050
silent silently

81
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,120
our voice command into the phone

82
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:37,519
good morning everybody going to talk
about the process for gross income an

83
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,659
injection in smartrend's so basically I
read for us talk about more trials had

84
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,320
said Sunday firm capabilities of
smartphones when I will briefly

85
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,440
introduce transmission principal and
field line coupling showing that it can

86
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,769
be complicated to model this kind of why
we decided to set up an experiment on

87
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:11,290
set up to try to inject worries and I
will show you some resumes further

88
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,010
information is basically that most some
smartphones are FM radio capable and for

89
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,050
receiving the FM radio signal you need
to plug your headsets headphones to the

90
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:31,279
store trance and another point is
basically when you want to ourselves if

91
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,110
you'd like to go if you want to start
the voice command interpreter you need

92
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:43,029
to press hard wooden jewellery to play
pause button on the headset true

93
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,980
information which are really interesting
is that we have true propagation part of

94
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,000
the electric signal on the headset
basically we have the FM processing path

95
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,370
which is basically a bandpass filter and
then a femdom which later and then you

96
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:06,990
are able to be some truth to radio and
the second parties low-pass filter

97
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,880
an amplifier

98
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,100
so the size of the characterization
characteristics of the audio input

99
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:20,740
interface is interesting as it also
enclose a.m. amplitude modulation

100
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:26,530
demodulation about something interesting
for us and we decided to investigate

101
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:35,400
what kind of signal we are able to
inject on this interface so as I said so

102
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,830
head from Zara boots FM radio signal
receiving antenna so it's basically the

103
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:50,450
AG regards to 108 megahertz frequency
band and the first consideration we had

104
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:57,360
these maybe we could be able to generate
a.m. which they should signal with voice

105
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,330
modulating the continuous wave and
basically abusing the low-pass filter to

106
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:11,680
remove for removing the very high
frequency consumers wave signal inducing

107
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:21,480
only signal modulating discontinuous way
so demand we have violated by using

108
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,670
software simulation is trying to
characterize low-pass filters and

109
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:36,040
amplifier so here we have we have on the
last voice commands and you have

110
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,579
continuous wave and what we do is
basically the country's wave weave this

111
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:49,920
audio signal and generated sorry
freudian Turner and check that basically

112
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,220
the signal electrical signal injurious
the voice input interface is basically

113
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,839
the audio signal we wanted to generate
so that's that's what we first tried by

114
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,870
simulation and then we said okay as we
have those information are we able now

115
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,010
to generate it and do it in real life so
basically just remember you that we have

116
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,970
a service generating p.m. field and we
have a receiving antenna which is a

117
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,840
federal and state funds

118
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,290
cable and the topic of them are we
called his front door coping as it is

119
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:37,390
intended to antenna communications so we
could also have their own the

120
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:45,670
modeling of the headphones for analyzing
the electric signal transmission lines

121
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:55,340
but basically what we had had some some
programs to model complex cables and we

122
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,280
have also to get to to to to
characterize the electric

123
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,840
characteristics of cables so the
permittivity and permeability of of

124
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:14,050
cables and also and I am i recall this
antenna cable coupling is called bagged

125
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:21,200
or shopping but in this research we only
focused on stronger coupling so are they

126
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,550
said Richmond aspects can be complex and
time-consuming so we decided to switch

127
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:37,450
to experimental validation of our people
faces so what do we need 222222 check

128
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:43,350
that we are able to inject voice is
basically you just need software defined

129
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:50,240
radio to generate amplitude modulated
signal in the right frequency bands you

130
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,510
need you may need also an amplifier as
you need a little bit of power and you

131
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:07,010
also need a set of targets we've
provided headphones by manufacturers

132
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:13,930
the first program that we have two
companies was generating signal on the

133
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,060
radio frequency band is not allowed

134
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,200
so we put a set of targets in a Faraday
cage so we should be doing and are

135
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,690
transmitting antenna inside so we have
no signal F signal from the outside and

136
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:36,089
you're not generating signal in the
electromagnetic environment outside

137
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:42,259
then another point that you need to be
able to 2222 characterizing to analyze

138
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:48,059
is what kind of seagulls isn't used on
the headphones so we installed

139
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:54,410
application to stream the audio input
from the set of targets and we stream

140
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:02,269
this signals to the outside of the
directive funding for education on a

141
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:09,649
monitoring computer and just you using
VLC to reach the streams audio signal

142
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,139
another point is basically that if when
you are using the voice command

143
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:23,029
interface unit to higher Internet access
so you may be using wifi or mobile

144
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:32,649
communication the mobile communication
interface so we decided to use wifi in

145
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:39,670
the Faraday cage to provide remote
access to internet and what based on

146
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:46,110
this first preliminary tests we have
seen that we were able to generate very

147
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:52,279
high frequency signal modulated with OJ
way firms and that's due in June 2020

148
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,990
away from was the audio signal we wanted
to end jews at the interests of the

149
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:07,559
audio interface of the smartphone then
we provided also internet to set of

150
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:14,329
targets we were testing and we have seen
that we were able to provide back

151
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:22,429
commands from the drought and execute
commands on the smartphone so just to

152
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:25,620
summer before they will show you some
movies

153
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,430
because at this point you need to trust
us the first thing is we analyzed two

154
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:39,320
scenarios the first one was the
interpreter the voice control command

155
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,660
control interpreters was activated by
default so we we generated only the

156
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,990
first key words and sounds there the
commando wanted to execute on their

157
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,450
smartphones and you know certain
disciplines in the second scenario which

158
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:05,250
tested if you were able to simulate the
hard press button on the mic of the

159
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:12,179
headphones and we have seen that the
same countries wave modulated frequency

160
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:19,699
modulated we were able to to enjoy this
hard pressed button so both scenarios

161
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,720
have been serving the required electric
fields around the target was 28

162
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,280
multimeter which is less funding human
safety limits so we were happy to see

163
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,360
that we were able to perform this kind
of research results going

164
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,820
concerning the limitations of this kind
of attack so we correct we characterized

165
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,660
the limits of the of this kind of of
scenarios so the internal size is quite

166
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,860
huge because we are in the very high
frequency frequency band and you need to

167
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,679
generates some large amount of power so
we have seen that basically for

168
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:16,679
generating 2008 water meter Arts 100
megahertz at one metre really 28 per

169
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,110
meter for the service so it just means
that if you want to increase the

170
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,620
distance between the source and the
target you need to to use some amplifier

171
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,940
so for true mature as we have seen that
we need forty what basically you can you

172
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,380
can put this kind of source in your
backpack if you want to perform this

173
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:51,250
kind of of tests 45 metre you need two
hundred what fire which is so then they

174
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:57,620
will present you some center was an
accident free we tested yeah so now we

175
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,940
know that we have a technique to
interact with the voice command

176
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,100
interpreters remotely and silently so

177
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,740
we can imagine we can conceive

178
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:14,100
several attack scenarios with Chara
resume here so I'm gonna presents

179
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,940
scenarios about tracking eavesdropping
custom views

180
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,679
reputation or phishing attacks malicious
application trigger and advanced

181
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,840
compromising of course so the first
scenario is about tracking so the idea

182
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,050
is that the attacker will activate the
wireless interfaces of the phone and

183
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,880
those interfaces partially WiFi and
Bluetooth send

184
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,559
frames over the year two

185
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,210
advertised for the presence of the
device or to advertise about

186
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:59,020
the services that the device is able to
serve to propose and of course in the

187
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,789
friends again you can find the mac
address so you can identify the device

188
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:10,490
and you can also conclude that the
devices in range of receiver so you can

189
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:18,950
track individual in certain zones using
this technique so we have for that the

190
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,880
first demo

191
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,830
we use a spice to whether activate or
deactivate a Bluetooth so the play the

192
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,280
payload that is sent over a year here is
my galaxy because he says it's on a

193
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,000
samsung galaxy and we just say the word
Bluetooth and this will act as a switch

194
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,960
so if they lose his own it will be it
will switch off and if it see if you

195
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,970
deserve it will switch the Bluetooth on
so I'm sorry for this video because the

196
00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:02,260
phone is in French and it's it's not
very but I guess you can you can see in

197
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,370
this video on the right part of the
phone you can see the microphone

198
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,070
pictogram and when there is

199
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,770
activity on the audio front-end detected

200
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,179
you will see some bars

201
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,400
on on the microphone pictogram and then

202
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,320
you will see that the phonies able to
interpret the same now that we inject as

203
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,050
the world

204
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:46,279
bluetooth

205
00:21:46,279 --> 00:22:04,749
ok so here I think you have the message
saying that the agency's disabled

206
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:16,090
because it was previously able enabled
so the next attack scenario is about

207
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:24,339
eavesdropping so here yet thanked her
simply foresees the target stone to make

208
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:27,730
a call to his monitoring phone

209
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,480
and

210
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,800
by doing that leads able to

211
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:40,440
listen to the targets sound environment
so here we are at attacking an iPhone 4

212
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,100
and

213
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,559
voice control it's not serious because
Syria was not enabled on the phone and

214
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,920
they're here we for the demonstration we
just asked to call

215
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,419
which is the contact entry the French
contact entry Florida

216
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,920
my account

217
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:18,790
contact

218
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:24,450
so here we interpreted the command and
the places of the call and what's

219
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,830
interesting is that there is no
notification so you see that the lock

220
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,710
screen is black and the user knows
nothing about the phone call it is

221
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:44,760
ongoing

222
00:23:44,760 --> 00:24:03,030
now that the notification of the phone
call

223
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:12,630
alright

224
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:19,160
the next day is about web browsing the
scenario hero could be

225
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,960
gustav uses attack so you can imagine a
massive attack in the crowded place

226
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,450
the Metro for example the subway and
hear the stories that you forrest the

227
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,649
victim to place a call or two send a
text message to a paid service or a text

228
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:43,770
message to subscribe to abate service
and so on

229
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,399
and here we demonstrate that

230
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,729
you are able to do some web browsing so
we are attacking an Android phone and

231
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:58,739
the Baylor here is OK Google and go to
www SSI

232
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:15,500
you if you have to spell the whole URL
so it's a long table

233
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,940
and you see the red dot means that there
is some activity on your your front end

234
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,430
and now the command went to the cloud
service to be interpreted it comes back

235
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:39,670
and then the website pops up

236
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,360
ok one can imagine also some reputation
or phishing attacks by abusing the

237
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,880
contacts of the

238
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,760
target phone so you can you imagine
sending embarrassing content or

239
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,800
publishing social media embarrassing
content

240
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,350
or even web search history poisoning and
of course you can send text messages or

241
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,659
emails

242
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:11,960
to the contact list of the the target we
can also imagine triggering a malicious

243
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,429
applications can be launching malicious
application when you wanted to perform

244
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:23,389
the malicious payload or just to send a
trigger to the application so that it

245
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:28,550
reads the debate on them and we can also
imagine a scenario where are you will

246
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,970
launching critical application here I
give an example

247
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,840
an application called season and

248
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,430
it's an application

249
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,640
which is related to

250
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,690
door lock the door lock is wifi enabled
so

251
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,970
you can open and close your door from
anywhere on the planet if you have

252
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,610
internet connectivity and here if you
wanna do you want to add taxes and you

253
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,750
just have to say okay Google's and it
will open the door

254
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:11,510
and just for the demo you we opened the
Gmail application you can see this video

255
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:17,450
you see well the Faraday cage we are in
and the big antenna we used to make the

256
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,020
tests but

257
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:27,720
you can do it with 36 matter and hero we
see that we succeeded to open the Gmail

258
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:40,950
application voice command interface and
finally we can you imagine several

259
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,180
advanced compromising scenario where you
use device command injection just as a

260
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,269
first step for a bigger attack I say

261
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:57,070
and you will try to exploit all their
vulnerabilities to further compromise

262
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,729
the user's device we can for example
imagine a silent application

263
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:04,150
installation

264
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,060
malicious web page

265
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:12,950
some research last year was published
under abusing the Samsung Knox to

266
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,750
install remotely and silence the
application of malicious application

267
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,240
just by visiting a web page you can also
imagine

268
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,110
any kind of wireless interfaces
exploitation where

269
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:34,620
you know the wifi for example sensor
probe requests and they're usually you

270
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,660
can find

271
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,659
the

272
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:37,530
last

273
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,920
Access Point name

274
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,870
in the broad request so inaccurate

275
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,230
create a rogue access point and then
perform some men in the middle on the

276
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,440
network on the wifi and then you can
even when you were in the middle you can

277
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,100
you can use the voice interface again to
launch an application that you can that

278
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:06,840
you want to monitor or attack so I'm
gonna present now some countermeasures

279
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,929
against this attack for users and
manufacturers and the main goal will be

280
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:20,630
to reduce the attacks are facing tax
impact increases

281
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,760
the required a tackle level and we also
have a proposition for detecting this

282
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,890
kind of attack for users the first thing
is unplug the headphones when you don't

283
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:38,790
need to to use them if you use the
headphones that have no microphone the

284
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:43,220
phone will detect that there is no
microphone and headphone cable and you

285
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,060
will never be able to use this as a
voice includes on the audio content so

286
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,450
it can you

287
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,980
countermeasure

288
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,980
of course use voice commands only when
you need it you can also think about

289
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,760
think of personalizing the keywords so
that the attacker has to personalize

290
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:10,090
attack also carefully selected the
commands that you want to make available

291
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:15,460
through the voice interface interpreter
especially before identification because

292
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,480
you can also use the voice command
before the lockscreen education and the

293
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,770
last one would be to enable many
feedbacks as possible so that the user

294
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:35,900
can notice when voice command is
executed and creditors is quite the same

295
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,340
we want from want them to limit the
critical commands that are available

296
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,350
through voice interface and

297
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:52,910
wisely choose the default settings of
the voice command interface also to

298
00:30:52,910 --> 00:31:00,039
reduce your tax her face they can also
reduce your different and sensitivity so

299
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:07,490
that the attacker needs no power to be
able to interact with the voice command

300
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,370
interpreter

301
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,480
voice recognition would be a good
solution to force further personal

302
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,510
personalization of the attack the
attacker would need to get some voice

303
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:26,030
samples of the victim before attacking
finer in savings for the user so that

304
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,210
the user can

305
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,610
we meet the

306
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,059
the attacks her face and the impact and
you can choose if you want to be

307
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:43,020
vulnerable or not and we

308
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,970
a technique to detect abnormal
electromagnetic activity around the

309
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,760
phone by using the built-in sensors that
are in inside the phone and this work

310
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:23,779
was published some months ago

311
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:32,679
the users to use it wisely by providing
a minor in settings and implement

312
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,059
security settings for forty seem to
phase and we also invite you all to take

313
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:44,849
a look at this interface there are many
attack vectors that we didn't try so go

314
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:45,740
on

315
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:53,690
critical and complex including defense
concerning intention electromagnetic

316
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,400
interferences basically we have been
working for a long time I might affect

317
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:07,000
on information systems electronic
devices that use of this kind of sources

318
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,120
was for damaging or destroying at least
electronic devices so it was limited to

319
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,740
general of services attacks and we have
shown here that using the smart

320
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,970
intention of electromagnetic
interferences you are able to perform

321
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:33,980
much smaller attacks and becomes very
interesting threads for information

322
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:40,670
security it's also interesting to ponder
that software defined radio and local

323
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:48,360
stump fire leads to designing low-cost
high power sources which need to be

324
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:56,070
taking taken into account in research
analyzes for critical infrastructures so

325
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,990
thank you for your attention is here we
have a set of references you can you can

326
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,960
look at it

327
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,770
image credits because we took some
pictures on the internet and would like

328
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,740
to thank you again and if you have any
questions please let us know we have our

329
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:23,190
email addresses thank you very much for
your attention

330
00:34:23,190 --> 00:35:54,119
to 100

331
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:22,369
there or is it just is it more
stationary yeah it depends as a shock

332
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:24,030
that slide

333
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,630
it's not here anymore

334
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:36,380
it depends on the range you you want to
reach so if you

335
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:42,020
are close to the target back

336
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:53,070
the amplifiers Dr computer and and you
can walk in the room and two two and a

337
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,250
half metres

338
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:07,910
reached the target but farther than that
you need to have more battery for the

339
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:31,550
the amplifiers the amplifiers are bigger
so it's limiting factor for that

340
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:57,010
fields we've already away so

341
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:08,720
when you have the signal level is really
low so if your computing the

342
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,520
signal-to-noise ratio you will be able
to check that basically attacks will be

343
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:28,040
possible in the classical normal
environment

344
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,450
okay thank you very much
