1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,880
we're good

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,990
seems like it

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,470
good morning

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,910
my name is Mario and today we're going
to talk about an interesting topic that

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,169
I decided to call copy and past and what
is that what might actually be before we

6
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:30,579
have a look at whether to release let me
introduce myself my name is Mario I'm a

7
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:35,790
researcher and a postdoc at the
University and a PhD thesis about

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,269
client-side security meaning browser
security cross-site scripting and those

9
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,519
things so when I received an alert box
popping up there was probably me credit

10
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:47,030
company that is located in Berlin
penetration tests consulting and will

11
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,680
force them to the best company in the
world I wrote some papers wrote a book

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,769
student talks in the past and treatment
and when and to maintain a bunch of

13
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,909
security related projects for example
the age of five security cheat sheet and

14
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,420
the dumb purified project was supposed
to be a client-side only excess food and

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,909
I think it's working quite well I truly
a bit and if you have any questions

16
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,259
after the talk all you want to reach out
to me you can just like send me an email

17
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:17,240
address now the topic they were gonna be
covering today I hope is fairly novel at

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,030
least I perceived it as a novel attack
vector of and something that is a little

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,240
bit weird and another requires a little
bit of user interaction but the user

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,690
interaction that is being required

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,940
doesn't imply that there could be any
security consequences the attack also

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,050
has a law which is extremely important
and that the local thanks on and it

23
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,770
pretty much expresses perfectly what's
happening here because we take a piece

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,830
of paper and this piece of paper looks
empty and then make me make a copy of it

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,090
and after having a look at the copy
realize that there's something bad on

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,690
their use the buck now to be able to
kind of explain to you what this whole

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,970
thing is about I decided to put the demo
that are usually at the end of the talk

28
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,440
at the very beginning of the talk now
let's think ourselves in the following

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,039
situation we have a user and the user
who wishes to compose an email message

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:14,120
and tended to another person and in the
process of composing the email message

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,030
the user decides to open Word or some
office software copy something from out

32
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,780
of there and throw down to the editor so
become part of the email I don't have a

33
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,440
look what happens here

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,250
here is actually brought in the newest
version so there's no legacy versions

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,360
involved and gmail on a trip you know
it's like one tool that you can use to

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,220
answer emails in the browser which is
observed that people use it and we want

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,920
to write a message so we could compose
and naturally the composer and oh yeah

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,720
we want to copy this one thing from this
one document into this email because the

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:01,000
boss said or it make sense or whatever
so nobody select this we do control CD

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,030
copy this we go back to Gmail and we
want to put it in here to control the

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,700
UPS

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,610
come from and how is that even possible
because the discussion of not making any

43
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:27,920
sense rate and it doesn't make any
reasons for the questioners would would

44
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,820
kind of sorcery was happening here like
rarer even offers so far away in Gmail

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,910
and then a Nexus S after pacing
something that is crazy and as witchery

46
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,520
offers were to find out about the
technical background we want to learn

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,110
what happened to and why did it happen
and what is like the underlying

48
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,520
technology that we can do something like
this and how is it possible that we melt

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,790
two things together of the deceiving
unrelated like an office software review

50
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,690
copy something from and a browser were
replaced into and what kind of thing is

51
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,670
obviously we're scripting here so that's
kind of script ish but we don't really

52
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,410
have sides that script each other so we
can call it access if you can call it

53
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,480
cross application scripting or something
like this and how is it possible at all

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,690
so to understand how this is possible we
have to have a look at a very specific

55
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,030
part of our operating system or rather
to be more precise of the window manager

56
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,320
of the operating system that reusing
because this is really

57
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,720
and to do so we have to walk back in
time a little bit and we have to kind of

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,870
have a look at how for example in the
medieval ages texts and books and

59
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,870
manuscripts and documents were edited
and preserved so in the years fire fire

60
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,180
fire in the medieval ages when the first
books were there and printed and written

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,170
sometimes those books would get moist
and they had to be repaired the paper

62
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,050
was ruined the whole book was ruined but
only parts of it so people came and you

63
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,690
are a blade and extracted parts from the
existing book and grade 2 collage that

64
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,330
would be the new book to preserve the
old work and the used by cutting

65
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,140
something and then pacing good things we
talked about cut and paste and even

66
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,590
today there susan was working in the
media industry you will see that there's

67
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,820
a lot of analog technology still around
in the new cap things in your place them

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,850
somewhere else and this is of course
quite useful and of course in computers

69
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,530
this technique and basically this
behavior was adopted this is absolutely

70
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,130
sons as one of the first computers
actually actively supporting something

71
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,160
like cut and paste or even pace so you
can copy something that you had in some

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,100
temporary storage and you pasted into
something else you could use it but of

73
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,330
course just text but however this
computer was the first one that actively

74
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,790
called it the clip art clipart I'm
referring to the location where the

75
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,010
state is being stored because you got
something going to be somewhere for some

76
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:07,120
time and it's going to be fetched from
there and when you paste and dig deeper

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,790
into the origins of the report you will
find that there's a bunch of white

78
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,970
papers in tech reports and some of them
came from IBM and IBM was nice enough to

79
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,740
say ok we're going to specify this and
this and that and should look like this

80
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,780
and should be like a storage container
for a bunch of different for months that

81
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,720
we can use in different applications
then Microsoft rolled in a little bit

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,760
ecology and thanks for the free ride
people it depend on that in the

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,830
independent-minded and Microsoft Windows
3.1 was the first operating system very

84
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,620
actually had complex copy and paste
complex means that you have the

85
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,020
possibility to store several objects and
the clipboard not just one single object

86
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,300
if you copy something I think ok there
is one string of texts but with Windows

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,400
3.1 star-tribune bunch of objects that
would contain different information

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,390
which is interesting and today has not
majorly from that it still is a place

89
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,120
where we store intermediate data so one
application where we copy from delivers

90
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,260
data and another application will
replace them to take the data and do

91
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,740
something with it and now to get closer
to the actual security program that we

92
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,290
just witnessed we have to ask ourselves
like how how does it work how does it

93
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,290
look like how can we get off to get a
clear impression of what we have in the

94
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,560
trip or how does it look like how was it
structured and I was looking for quite

95
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,350
some time and trying to find out the
answers to this and I was running into

96
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,620
this old ancient piece of freeware don't
even have to work today in 1990 but cool

97
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,500
clip you and I think it's written by
German dude computer and it's

98
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,919
effectively a rock a party or so did you
the possibility to have a look at the

99
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,000
Royal representation of the clipboard
content and this tool helps us to learn

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,200
a thing because as you can see here in
the screenshot the clipboard is not just

101
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,710
one object that is holding one bit of
data but the bunch of objects but all

102
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,850
different kinds of data that all try to
at best

103
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:06,240
resemble the data that be copied so I
was also trying to find a tool to do the

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,060
same thing on limits because the song
lyrics and windows but then a record of

105
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,510
the disorder runs on Windows you want to
kind of do the same thing and do the

106
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,529
same analysis on a Linux system with ago

107
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,949
window manager just running with wine
it's like a very simple tool is

108
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,379
perfectly fine however little of what it
actually does so here we have a text

109
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,319
file and text files a very simple they
don't contain any mark are poorly ot nor

110
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,649
complexities llegaron text so you would
think if you copy a bit of raw text but

111
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,079
not much was gonna go on just like one
string of texts and that should be one

112
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:42,939
object in the clipper but not as you can
see in the screenshot

113
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,860
bunch of objects in the clip art despite
us just copying Rotax from note that we

114
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:55,339
see we have one bucket that recalls we
have one bucket that because one bucket

115
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,040
that because he was cortex and one more
bucket that because you text they

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,059
literally all contain the same data and
different representations in case some

117
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,559
software comes receives the pace and
cannot deal with one of the

118
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,309
representations to this another one but
even for text just like simply vote

119
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:16,949
exigency there's a sort of complexity
when you go ahead and for example open

120
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:23,279
Word file with work to us over two words
2013 and Jacoby something from there and

121
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,139
then you have a look at the clipboard
and you realize there's a lot of stuff

122
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:35,250
in your data object object descriptor
rich text format HTML format tax duty

123
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,100
could text and has a metafile medical
picked embed source later on early and

124
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,709
so on and so on its own so keeping
something from the not meant for buckets

125
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,800
of being created

126
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
copying something convert almost twenty
buckets are being created all containing

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,959
different data with the same information
just in different representations and

128
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,350
one of them is already highlighted hope
you can see it on the screen and is the

129
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,120
interesting one of these for my case and
that's a HTML format so that seems to me

130
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,040
that the software Ryan copying from is
creating different representations of

131
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,410
the data that I am copy and restore from
four months and one of those four months

132
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,879
is something that the browser can
understand so then the browser would

133
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,920
come would say okay I'll just take this
one this particular bucket because I

134
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,889
understand this and the other ones I
don't understand now it's interesting

135
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,769
and if you see this piece of XML you
know immediately this is discuss

136
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,899
like everybody likes HTML actually likes
HTML with see this and be offended

137
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,600
because this is a disgusting
interpretation of HDL should look like

138
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,629
in the eyes of an office offer you can
see those styles of the property stuff

139
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:43,379
in their hours before murder with single
quotes and one in this is discussing

140
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:52,009
HTML HTML is being produced by Microsoft
Office and you can also see that

141
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,149
fragments of the text composed and
Microsoft Office are still in the first

142
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:04,129
there was just in here and you're my
hero and so on so we have a connection

143
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:09,069
between what we write an office and what
arose in the HTML maybe we can do more

144
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:15,249
of it but to recover the hard work's
it's essentially very very simple you

145
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:19,869
copy from an application the application
details on its own what kind of

146
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:24,429
backwards it creates in the clipboard it
creates those buckets with different

147
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:30,040
representations of the data copied and
then a different application also word

148
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,910
be the browser abused Microsoft Paint
whatever it could be then decides which

149
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,769
one of the buckets to take doesn't
understand hTML doesn't understand rich

150
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,040
text format RTF pocket and so on and so
on

151
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,709
that is quite interesting and it's not
even a negotiation process just pick the

152
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:53,569
right one that understanding to be good
with that you could for example to copy

153
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:57,730
files and then you see with the
representation is that file handles and

154
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,529
pointers to the file system and what not
copy lot of things you can copy sound

155
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,300
waves and sound edit or bitmaps complex
data structures application always

156
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,190
decides what kinda pockets to create and
maybe the other application where you

157
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,649
place them to find the bucket that it
likes understands and in deals with it

158
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:22,470
now because that's kind of what we're
clipboard attacks or copy and paste

159
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,649
supported attacks are not new to
remember the old days when there was

160
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,970
likely security forums on the web
security forums on the Linux forums and

161
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,250
Tamil Telugu I don't know who cannot
connect my second monitor to my computer

162
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,949
and Linux and always produces errors and
someone says the Cole you just have to

163
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,620
do this one thing here is the code just
logged in as root and put it in the

164
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,470
console and then you would copy the code
from the forum and put in the console

165
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,290
and then there was textin there was 10
and then your opponent but what is new

166
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,250
is that we can actually seemingly crea
cross-site scripting and maybe even more

167
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,389
by copying data between applications
completely different applications now

168
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:06,329
how can we do that and how does it work
that's what we want to find out

169
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:11,149
well the first thing we have to do is
look for correspondence seized that

170
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,790
means we create a file in this
particular case in the office with

171
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,220
written ODT file and put some text in
there and then we save this thing we

172
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,389
format the text mostly they began and
then we have a look at what's happening

173
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,529
tool that is online you can find it at
80 mph I forgot or color copy and paste

174
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,170
it gives you information about the
resulting HTML so you can quickly copy

175
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,040
something from summer pasted in there
and then get more information about how

176
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,870
the XML looks like and as you can see
the HML that OpenOffice fruit producing

177
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,430
only prophecies producing is not
particularly nicer than the crap that

178
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,459
Microsoft was producing so all those
office offers seem to have their

179
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:54,130
interpretations of how it should look
like you can see that a lot of property

180
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,850
here to suffice and that's not really
hmm but you can also see that we have

181
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,490
interesting correspondences here because
we see here is drink

182
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,520
inside CSS and the stream is describing
a font name and that is exactly the fund

183
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,700
that we have been chosen here so those
correspond to put a forehand into the

184
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,060
document we define which can afford it
is then be copied this thing you put it

185
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,610
into the browser and receive the phone
name again so that is interesting

186
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,630
a we have correspondent see be strange
dreams are cool even see three funds

187
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:32,350
because there is localization happening
if your office is running in europe your

188
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,850
default fund would be liberation songs
if its running and China are Asian

189
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,640
countries it would be when twenty Micro
Hi if its running an Indian countries

190
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,270
and surrounding areas it's using a bit
in which is quite interesting because

191
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,500
even if you're not there the local funds
are still there but you're never gonna

192
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,839
see them in the office document because
they just wait for you to have the right

193
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,300
locals who have something that is hidden
but still makes it across the copy and

194
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,370
paste direction so we need to find out
doesn't really correspondent and yes it

195
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:03,830
does

196
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,550
another question is if it corresponds
and we modify the file directly in get

197
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,779
more correspondents have more impact on
what is actually arriving in the

198
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,920
clipboard and then arriving into pasted
application and she believes her before

199
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,570
office files because office files are
nothing else but the files so it was

200
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,420
renamed to zip and you have a look at
the thing and it opens and you see a

201
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,970
folder structure in the folder structure
you see bunch of files and one of those

202
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,770
files looks attractive because it's
called styles XML and you would assume

203
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,220
that nostalgic similar will find the
styles and indeed you do you will find

204
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,640
the folder view you double-click the
status until you open an editor of your

205
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,360
choice and you get a huge bunch of XML
and again you can see that in the XML

206
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,029
file inside the office file you find
that particular font name school know if

207
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,130
you start messing around with this and
edited manually then save it again put

208
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,930
it back in the zip file then renamed as
a fallback to ODT opening with

209
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:05,570
OpenOffice then copy and paste it into
the browser maybe it's a vice and indeed

210
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,960
us so it was dry and I was like
basically saying okay

211
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,680
we arrive in style element we saw this
with the origin market that we could be

212
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,780
pasted so let's be unfriendly
indiscriminate and as you can see I do

213
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,430
this year and then after that let's just
start a new XML element and see if it

214
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,600
corresponds

215
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,880
amusing an element so everything
afterwards refuse truck so I saved this

216
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,190
I rebooted in the zip file a remembers
applicant ODT open in OpenOffice a copy

217
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,770
of the thing at a time to the browser
and while there is indeed struck text so

218
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,860
we can inject HTML into this thing by
terminating the style that has been

219
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,740
generated by offers and then it appears
on the page that is pretty cool that

220
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,630
gives us a lot of injection potential
now you might think the talks over you

221
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,930
know how to inject this right now very
very simple just put something in there

222
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,670
are some of my friends are gonna be done
but is unfortunately not that simple

223
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:07,500
because browsers are aware of the risk
of receiving something from the outside

224
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,329
world by the clipboard accepting the
demand putting into the dog could be

225
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,550
anything in there so with the browser
eternally does mister Senate ice this

226
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,550
thing so it runs through senators Asian
process and it strips out everything

227
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,730
that is seemingly malicious scripts
iframes tablets and beds objects this

228
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,960
all goes out this is not part of the
clipboard anymore all those elements

229
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:38,220
have to leave so there is a filter to
bypass that food can we do that

230
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,700
and of course we can because sanitizers
always have a flaw the questions like

231
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,510
how can you find the flocking you
spotted a particularly working the

232
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,570
browser field you know that you only
have to take technologies that are not

233
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,530
that well supported yet in one of these
technologies is indeed SVG

234
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,720
talk about SVG some years ago in this
very conference and actually that helped

235
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,390
me because one of the tricks I
discovered back then I could reuse in

236
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,020
this research so this is the bypass and
I think it's true we don't have to

237
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,490
explain sorry we do have to explain this
we're doing here is we're closing the

238
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,049
style element and with a closing the
style element relieve the strain relief

239
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,340
funding believe the style we can inject
new age tomorrow we can not use any

240
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,490
script a free member object and
something like this event has nothing

241
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,340
but we can use SVG SVG democrat another
silent and we have to create style

242
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,240
element after style element the person
the purpose of this many style elements

243
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,419
is to make sure that there is a panel

244
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,919
overlapping everything in Gmail because
i dont have the top spot where people

245
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,360
are supposed to execute the JavaScript
because I want the whole window to be

246
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,240
infected of course there is a bunch of
style elements and I wanted to put this

247
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,320
into one that element only but then I
realized because there's a person back

248
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,610
and once you see me Collins the whole
thing goes up so the semicolons on

249
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,760
Amazon were forbidden couldn't use them
as characters so I had to do it like

250
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,700
this and create one style property that
I want to consider making a big box and

251
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,860
inconsiderate and outcomes the extreme
magic as mentioned no scripts

252
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,520
my friends know nothing nothing that is
seemingly dangerous but what we can do

253
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,400
is use another well-known feature in SVG
that is called animation we can any made

254
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,990
ourselves into being dangerous that
means that in the original today the

255
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,230
league is not dangerous and here we have
that link you can see it has excellent

256
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,220
hatred and the nature of his pointing to
a dangerous doesn't hurt but then we put

257
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,190
a circle into that link so we have like
a visual graphic element and we put in

258
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,830
any major element into the link

259
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,730
we say hey I want this thing to be any
made after some time

260
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:52,019
0 seconds and the element and the
intruder want to any made a trip you

261
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,049
might ask yourself why X 28 roof esta
bien imitable butters and that is cool

262
00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:03,539
so we any made this morning with second
0 from a javascript your eye to an end

263
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:09,690
percent and the funny thing is that in
XML and XML you cannot really represent

264
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,330
but the parser doesn't realize that in
time so what the person is obscene words

265
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,190
we want to have an animation and we want
to any made the link to imprisoned and

266
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,340
it seems like I cannot do this it's nine
percent I can only do this in XML have

267
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,360
to escape it throws an error and that
animates the link back to the original

268
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,019
spade the technically number was there
before and it sets up to the from

269
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,590
attribute so this is how we treat the
sanitizer but just like having a

270
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,519
harmless taking the beginning causing an
error in the animation and then forcing

271
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,710
the browser to go back to the state that
we technically never had but this is the

272
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,889
adopted so then the link has a new a
trip and Edison javascriptyour I that is

273
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:51,380
alerting document domain are doing
whatever you want to so then of course

274
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,210
we have to escape the whole thing
because we're inside example we have to

275
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,159
take this whole bunch of code injected
into the styles XML the move to save the

276
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,889
whole thing and then be copied the
result this is actually called from

277
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,789
Gmail so you can see we have little
break here we have to defuse that says

278
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,360
clinton edible false things turn out to
be clickable we see the battery of

279
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,639
stalin's we have fewer we have linked
that has a trip to see the animation

280
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:20,720
the imprisoned from value works and
works in Firefox and Chrome so

281
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,610
interesting Leonardo Norway both
browsers and both sanitizers have been

282
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,919
bypassed with the same vector there was
quite nice and safe enough time so to

283
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,320
see this again step by step what we did
was quitting in the playoffs documentary

284
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,159
naming of commodities to open this is a
popular styles XML mister on with the

285
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,059
styles change the font names safety
would be compressed third arm recalled

286
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,070
from the oddity open the Sun OpenOffice

287
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,720
wrote something copy paste this number
of excess it's been complicated but

288
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,269
eventually you get there and was like ok
interesting most kind of amnesia attack

289
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:02,130
because it's just like only two hours
and only once offer and extent of stores

290
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,630
offer and had a look at PBS and of
course you can do the very same thing

291
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,779
however it's different because PDFs as
we all know are not so you can adjust go

292
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:15,779
into this thing you have to use a text
editor or exit or actually take this

293
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,779
thing so what I did was again open the
PDF and look for fun names because this

294
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:24,929
is where you want to find herself
because fun names are strings and those

295
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,389
who can manipulate and indeed a condom
and here we have one example we see

296
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:34,259
double quote language Visual Basic
Script on Flickr low-priced like why

297
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,450
does it look so weird why did I have to
use Visual Basic Script well there is a

298
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,120
constrained in PDFs of fun name can
contain all sorts of characters but it

299
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,070
cannot contain parentheses so I couldn't
execute anything and had to rely on

300
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,019
Visual Basic Script to use code
execution that does not require

301
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:57,179
parentheses so there was just a little
tricky luckily its future save because

302
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,259
in the new job as conversion

303
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,059
skeptics you can also use tactics to
execute functions and tactics are

304
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,210
allowed for fun games on apprentices
have been so again we have the same

305
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,000
scenario created by nine PDF accident or
fun names we met with the funk names

306
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,649
were safe the whole thing make sure that
everything is online test the PDF

307
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,850
Converter Deluxe the same it does look
the same copy something else and I E or

308
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,620
any other browser and we have the alert
so we could also infect PDFs with the

309
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,059
JavaScript of magic and make sure that
whenever someone copies and then pay

310
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:34,210
something then the personal be infected
with whatever

311
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,530
and I then had a look at office and get
office was literally the same things are

312
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,580
essentially you take a Word file be at
doc or B dawg

313
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,110
acts to open it doctors for example
would be

314
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:52,000
opening with the ex editor and beauty of
16 text that is in there we enter the

315
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,210
text that we want to inject again with
the font names we savored resend it

316
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,720
around someone doesn't open copy paste
from it and then the persons infected

317
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:08,059
with the newer document filed that
Microsoft Word provides tax it's easier

318
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,679
because then it's against the files so
we can rename then have a look and then

319
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,630
and counterintuitive leave the style
information in docx files will not be

320
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:25,520
found in actual files XML but we found
in document XML or content that took me

321
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,650
some time to refine it because they had
weird funny and it doesn't make any

322
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,559
sense and again we can't abused Parsifal
trailers and we can abuse other

323
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,070
interesting things that happen inside
the browser that enable us to create

324
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,059
payload that these babies unfolds and
then execute JavaScript here we applaud

325
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,330
the doesn't even make sense and we see
that we have the entity for the

326
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,780
quotation marks and we have a single
quote and that doesn't make sense

327
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,340
because we don't break anything willard
but it still worked because in the

328
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,120
process of converting the data inside
the browser IE had a bark that was

329
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,299
converting this one to another double
quote I'm not really sure why but it did

330
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,600
so and this is how I managed to break
out there was produced and the result

331
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,260
again with Gmail as you can see it we
have been up here we have that thing

332
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,200
that we injected we see that there is a
span and that there was several attempts

333
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,780
of mine to actually get something in
here most of them failed this one field

334
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,650
this one filled with one field but this
one did not so I just tried different

335
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,419
entities different clothes and
eventually dropped was a simple thing

336
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:32,160
against Emanuel fighting against is
quite nice step by step we created dock

337
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,010
we put a hyperlink in the dock with an
open the doc with a hex editor at The

338
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,220
Bachelor on the hyperlink to
considerable faltered can be clicked

339
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,840
savored

340
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,130
reopen it copy something in the bucket
is being created and you didn't bother

341
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,650
and execute and the same thing with
Exodus open a zip file inject the stuff

342
00:25:53,650 --> 00:26:01,299
they began and funniest part because
eventually my goal was to extend this to

343
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,650
as many pieces of office software
entries many brothers as possible to

344
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:12,110
have full coverage was when having a
look at XPS and weirdos XPS supposed to

345
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,010
be like the PDF killer or were supposed
to be the PDF killer but only that it

346
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,080
never was and it's one of Microsoft's
ideas to create like document for months

347
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,870
that have all resources that they need
embedded and accredited XPS and had a

348
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,460
look at these things like what is this
this is not really a foul missus not

349
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,370
really a recovery in his sword I can
find any foreign names and there nothing

350
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:43,029
corresponds everything looked like
garbage trucks they look at the

351
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:49,240
specification of XPS and try to find out
how those XP X 4000 created and it turns

352
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,570
out that the use of proprietary
compression algorithm and I was kind of

353
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,090
far too lazy to learn this compression
algorithm and be able to edit it

354
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,570
manually over the script so I thought of
a different way and the different way

355
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,580
was fairly easy straightforward because
pacification of XPS well you can embed

356
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,659
stuff and any fund that the use in the
document will be embedded as well so I'm

357
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:17,490
just gonna create an evil front and a
dollar and some open source phone from

358
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,110
somewhere on the internet and I use my
favorite we thought that was just 14 and

359
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,789
opened the fund and had a look at stream
properties inside the front insert the

360
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:30,330
funds metadata and iPhone under for
example there is one properties set let

361
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,659
us call TDs names and there's a bunch of
things in leather the cooperate

362
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,460
information the dude who created for the
version and some other things that had a

363
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,210
minor edit them all and see which one
comes through and it turns out that

364
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,360
precisely the property English USA
stream for preferred family is the one

365
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,090
that arrives in the market if you copy
and paste I do not really know why

366
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,559
but it does so the process was easy

367
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,120
ticket refund from somewhere I modify
the properties owned my own integrity

368
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,029
system I credit document that fund and
save the document I exported as an XPS

369
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:05,460
of the founders and better including the
malicious fund named Dennis in this

370
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,309
document around some people that
something is being pasted into the

371
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:12,940
browser the militias font name is
included into the pace and then we have

372
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,640
a Nexus S in this particular situation
was quite funny because the XSS didn't

373
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,230
require any user interaction and didn't
have to click anything for this

374
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,000
particular situation the sanitizer was
off and I do not really know why but it

375
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,760
was off so I could just have to do is an
iframe

376
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,870
human fund named involving iframe I was
sitting at a table falter really execute

377
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,580
and that was it like you pasted in bloom

378
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:45,399
JavaScript execuse of course and so
we've had another exercise I can have

379
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:50,340
reached the point where all office
offers affected you can modify all

380
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,419
office files or whatever category of
whatever kind fiddle around with the

381
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:58,559
contents this or the other way change
some things and make sure you different

382
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,809
infected document and inside the
infected document when someone opens it

383
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,200
there is no indicator that something was
wrong you don't see the phone names you

384
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,200
don't see anything broken you don't get
any warnings just a regular office file

385
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
to copy something from it

386
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,140
you pasted and then blows up so we can
use a browser that works texas ass you

387
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,450
can use doc and docx to browser works
perfectly fine with XPS to browser works

388
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,980
so did your browser and so on and so on
so literally all pieces of office offer

389
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:32,460
are affected and in areas affected some
of them are not even more because I felt

390
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,950
him and he was working on it

391
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,429
chrome is currently working on it and
Firefox of was working on it is almost

392
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:39,380
done so

393
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,660
some fixes are already out some re
usable yet after the process of course

394
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,100
and the figures after we finish chrome
is not done yet they're working on it I

395
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,920
was thinking ok this is interesting I
personally like grocery stores because I

396
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,290
like browsers and integrated text
service but this might also work in

397
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,090
other situations and played a little bit
around and defined on the for example in

398
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,260
exile if you copy something from
excellent to the browser but what

399
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,770
happens if you copy something from the
browser into axle how far can you go

400
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,580
that the test with excellent 2013 and
they have this amazing you function are

401
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,250
actually the formula formula is called
web service so with a veteran formula

402
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,200
you can fire a request from the style of
from those pressured to an external web

403
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,120
servers you get the response back to
connect the response to a table and then

404
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,180
you can kind of XML and

405
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,370
XQuery or of its past weeks ago into
this thing and read certain date and

406
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,880
then working with them and in truth the
soyuz risky to me and I think Microsoft

407
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,890
agrees on that being a risky formula so
whenever you use it in an axial file and

408
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,130
someone opens a text file then there
will be a warning first and said hey

409
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,690
dude you cannot you cannot do this or be
careful because this tries to connect to

410
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,450
external web service to you or anyone
that however if it comes from the clip

411
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,120
art then there's no standardization at
all there is no warning there is no

412
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,950
filters there is no dialogue a just
requests for that school so I mean I

413
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,560
felt like a little bit on crack because
the idea was crazy but what we could do

414
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,100
is create a copy and paste Internet port
scanner of some sorts so I combined the

415
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,230
web service function with excellent if
I'm not sure about the current status

416
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,480
but I think it doesn't have an alt so
the only thing you could do is just like

417
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,860
have many many many many of its ok if
they're called to the web servers with

418
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,870
the IP address this and this and that
and the specific part return something

419
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,810
then we have an open part of it doesn't
return anything when we don't have an

420
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:48,130
open court and it did this resulting in
a huge formula but if you make it

421
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,710
invisible copied it from somewhere and
pasted into excellent was doing but the

422
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,360
two did anything time and its on-time
rate on calculating and requesting and

423
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,650
then you get results from the port scan
because eventually after it found an

424
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,100
open ports and where it would issue
another web service request and said the

425
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:08,490
you felt inside the structure and that
would go to you to europe control server

426
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,420
and you could see the log files that the
internet that particular part is open

427
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,550
which is quite nice and kind of points
in the direction where you can go with

428
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,530
us because there's many many
possibilities for exploitation and not

429
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:24,780
just brought in as much as a success
that I was thinking ok maybe we can

430
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,890
extend the service a little bit and
removed the constrained of having a user

431
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:34,280
to be forced to kind of copy something
from somewhere maybe we can copy for the

432
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,130
Jews are without the user even noticing

433
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:43,120
/ and flashes an amazing technology and
has almost no security problems except

434
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,210
for this particular one in that meeting
flash you can fill the clip art and you

435
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,580
have an API that fills the clipboard for
you and you can define what kind of

436
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,030
buckets are supposed to be created in
Flash allows you to create an RTF bucket

437
00:32:55,030 --> 00:33:00,330
a text bucket and an HMO pocket that's
nice that's exactly what I need however

438
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,180
to do this in flash without getting any
warnings or any dialogue to have to have

439
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,160
the Cliq

440
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,480
/ only fills the clip or for you when
you issue so you need to trust events we

441
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,940
need to get the user to click I guess
not that hard but I wanted to make it a

442
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,560
bit more settled so I decided to take a
flash file and click Enter in there and

443
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,340
have to click in the reactor weekly by
filling the clipboard with oratory

444
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,570
garbage and the payload and then it took
that flash file

445
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,200
embedded in the PDF file because PDF can
of course and then flash and then add to

446
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,230
the PDF file and click somewhere in the
PDF file I had the Cliq a recycled the

447
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,380
event a little bit later effort to clip
art and had the feeling that was really

448
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,780
copy and pasting something copying
something but would actually happen in

449
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,560
the big room with flash filling the
clipboard for me was something

450
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,160
completely different and then went to
the browser at whatever location I

451
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,460
pasted it in my payload but not the pill
actually believed to have copied it is

452
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,700
quite nice so we used to select one
thing or trick and the network's

453
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,110
coverage on the course material like all
the other talk materialism get up you

454
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,970
gonna see the link later on so you can
grab those files you can play with them

455
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,560
yourselves you can optimize them if you
want to sort of gonna be available now

456
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,460
the question is what do we do against
that because that kind of sucks and

457
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,520
technically any documented we have our
own could be infected with this already

458
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,270
we wouldn't even though because those
things would be happening invisibly and

459
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,840
for the broader world I decided to
experiment a little bit Android browser

460
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,110
extension and I use my own project done
purify which is a Nexus S any doubt as

461
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:36,500
mentioned and I connected it inside the
browser extension with pasty vans and

462
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,350
try to sanitize everything before it's
actually getting pasted but I'm really

463
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,540
better Belapur and that offers so creepy
that I can only recommend will never use

464
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,740
dogs just kind of proof of concept if at
all and I used to demo this during the

465
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,820
last times when they gave the stalk and
it always worked at home but it never

466
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,580
regard the conference November of this
I'm just gonna embarrass myself but I

467
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,110
can only show you the code or the
approach of the choice was basically

468
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,200
waiting for the load event and starting
to run the extension code creating a

469
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,440
virtual clipart which is essentially not
moving out but an element

470
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,490
namely a textarea listening for past
events that are happening on the entire

471
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,520
page then redirect those past events
into the textarea than taking the value

472
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,640
for the textarea pumping of purified
sanitizing it and then issuing the

473
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,770
actual event of person is complete
nonsense and no one should ever use that

474
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,410
but it gave me at least the impression
that there can be some defense that you

475
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,140
cannot solve problems

476
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,580
lastly you do have to work the browser
vendors to fix this because the office

477
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,730
people cannot that's not their job I
mean they do produce faulty HTML but I

478
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,420
don't see them every week seamless so
primarily the browser vendors have to

479
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,130
fix their capital advisers and make
things right again and I mean this is

480
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,550
just like a small piece of the entire
cake because I believe you can do more

481
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,790
things with that depending on what kind
of application you're copying from

482
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,210
application of pacing into anything
could happen like there is no limits I

483
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,330
mean I have no idea how office after
reacts I was trying a little bit to kind

484
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,510
of get mark Roseburg into xell dialogues
and stuff like this but failed but an

485
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,830
office expert obviously and as that with
the boss a reason but I think if you

486
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:19,510
have a look at this to put some brains
into that then you can find amazing

487
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,820
things depending on what kind of
software that's being used so I heavily

488
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,380
encourage everybody who do have a look
at the things you find this interesting

489
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,030
because I'm pretty sure that there's a
lot of OD and people do copy and paste

490
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,590
them I don't copy and paste and
directions all the time

491
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,910
day by day another defense would maybe
for example would be to use Ctrl Shift

492
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:43,250
fee but honestly I am so used to control
the that I wouldn't think of this

493
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,040
particular situation some people told me
after the talk that they actually use

494
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,030
the notepad the notebook is continuously
open all the time and whenever they copy

495
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,470
and paste something they almost would
rather not bed

496
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,040
from the application into the Northport
from the north heading to the other

497
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,910
applications the car right sure where
activity so people to use copy paste a

498
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,650
lot of people to trust this whole thing
and it is transparent have no idea

499
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,250
what's going on the clipboard unless you
explicitly look so as mentioned I think

500
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:16,599
there's a lot of stuff to explore and
basic conclusion if you to copy and

501
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,830
paste be careful anything could be in
there if you copy paste into the browser

502
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,830
from any other exam resource be extra
careful because you have no idea what

503
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,960
could be in there could be access could
be some leakage could be anything so

504
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,430
that was pretty much it and if you want
to have a look at the proof of concepts

505
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,080
the top material and the slights
everything's on line just before the top

506
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,099
title and you will find the sites and on
the slide you will find a link directly

507
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,240
to get up there you have all the files
to play with all the PTS all the docs on

508
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,180
the dock access the excel file reports
going to play with it let me know if you

509
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,970
like it and thank you much
