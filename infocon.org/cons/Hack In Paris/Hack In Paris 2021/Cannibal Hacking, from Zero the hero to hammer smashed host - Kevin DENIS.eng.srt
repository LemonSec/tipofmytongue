22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
at uh at the time

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,640
and usually usually i spend time in

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
front of ida

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,840
but

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
today we won't talk about this

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,559
today

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,079
uh the talking about web security or

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,438
lack of security if a european tester or

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,280
web administrator

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
you must have seen

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,760
a lot of weird logs

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,400
lot of wear files on your web route

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
everybody has dealt with at least one

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,240
fishy links

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,880
once received by email and so on today

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,840
it's the

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
subject of the talk

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,119
one last word before starting

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,560
timer has spent

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
since the submission of this talk

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
as you know

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
presentation was delayed like two years

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
you've heard of it

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
so some timestamps may be old on this

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,920
presentation but everything is still

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
true i kept up to date

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,439
some screenshots and so on so

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,960
everything is okay

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
so

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
imagine just imagine you are a bad guy

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,600
and

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,479
you want to deliver all of your malware

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
all of your spam all of your payload and

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
you really don't want to be worried

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,239
of it if your website is taking down

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
or if law enforcement comes in or things

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
like that

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
so instead of hosting uh all of those

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
files in your system

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
why not using web servers belonging to

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,400
others

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
they pay the hosting

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
the

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,080
they will be in trouble if something

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,239
goes wrong so it's really platform of

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,280
choice

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
and

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
sometimes web servers are fully

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,959
configured so it's easy to them to sneak

71
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
in and put all of the data out of the

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
payload

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
so let's see

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
you see this is a french restaurant

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
really really nice

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,879
this restaurant has a blog and

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,400
the last blog in the last articles are

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
not about food this is not about a

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,319
restaurant this is not about

80
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,760
advertisement

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,000
if you click on it you end up with a

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
reservoir on your on your

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,879
on your computer

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,640
or another one

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
as you can see this web server delivers

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
spam

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,840
if you know bigo

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
please don't don't put anything personal

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,239
on that

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,720
it will be your store by a bad guy and

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
reused against you and you have

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,400
many other

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,879
many other fishings as you can see uh

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,000
dragon e and view paypal you must know

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,799
it

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
and if you put your login and password

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,200
on this paypal page

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
you will quickly lose all of your money

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,599
i said that

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,439
usually it's a web server fully

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,040
configured

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
please don't blame the admin

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,959
everybody knows security is hard

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,760
usually they have no time to patch

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
it's done

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
eventually by people not

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
still in tech

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
so it's hard not a distort i don't want

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
to to blame

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,918
i have a personal story

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,000
right near my home there is a theater

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
this theater still have a blog a website

113
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
this theater doesn't exist anymore for

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
maybe five or six years but

115
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,000
their website is still up there is

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
nobody no admin nothing

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
it's

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
totally obsolete filled up with very

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,919
vulnerability and there are efficient on

120
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,040
it

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
but

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
as long as the dns and web server is up

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
as people will

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,639
using

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
it

126
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
but

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,080
we can turn this

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,919
into an advantage for us

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,919
because

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,759
it turns out that a lot of the bad guys

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
don't don't know a basic security issue

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,400
they use a poorly

133
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
secured web server so they are poorly

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,639
secured

135
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,440
they let director listing enabled they

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
use bad passwords too

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
they reuse and use and you reuse the

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
same online technique

139
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
answer and so on and so on

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
so

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,840
really really we can take advantage of

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
them

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
and uh what can we do

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
we can uh dork

145
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
google dork usual things as you can see

146
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,120
so

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
we won't

148
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
ask

149
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,479
ourselves a host we just will try to

150
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,440
find those hacked websites on the

151
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,919
internet

152
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,199
google

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
google is a

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
efficient

155
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,280
search website

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
it's a good device hard to say

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,440
but

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
google

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,440
is used to hide some results so

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
you will have to fight a bit against

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
google to find really really interesting

162
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
results as an example i'll show you

163
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
sometimes you could search

164
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,240
for a access.log file because you can

165
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
learn a lot a lot of information from a

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,479
weblog

167
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,080
from

168
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,960
the access level and if you search

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
with an easy search access log with a

170
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
log extension

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,319
there is

172
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,160
853 results

173
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,479
no that's not

174
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
that's not

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
that's incredible there must be more

176
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
more than that and if you look at the

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,160
file the first one is really not an

178
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
access log file

179
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
and if you know

180
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
if you refine a bit your your searches

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
now you have 14 000 results that's

182
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
really really better and as you can see

183
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
this is a real access.log file so uh you

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,080
have really two uh dork

185
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,880
google in order to to bypass all of the

186
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,840
blacklist

187
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,479
another

188
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
another example if you want to find a

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
data lake of emails and password

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
if you search

191
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
for a leaked leaked email or password

192
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
links or things like that you won't get

193
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
anywhere but if you search for

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,240
this hash eaten idc

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
answered

196
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,240
you will find a lot of fix

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
why

198
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,120
because

199
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,560
the worst worst password of all time is

200
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,919
one two three four five six and a uh

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,879
use

202
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
a bad action algorithm but

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
used a lot is

204
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
md5

205
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,120
so

206
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,440
imagine that a hacker is

207
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,759
leaking

208
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,039
hacking a database a database there is a

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
high probability that at least one

210
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
person has used

211
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,440
the one two three four five six password

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,479
so

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,000
the pirate the bad guy will get

214
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,958
this

215
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,159
hash

216
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,958
in its files it will

217
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,080
he will store the leak on a website with

218
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
the txt extension

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
and with that you can find a lot of

220
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
flicks

221
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,560
put put made by the pirates

222
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,920
uh

223
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,399
with a good dogs you will find a lot a

224
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,800
lot of hacking material

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
you can search when you when you know

226
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
what's your name you can still search

227
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
for the name it works it still works you

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
can also search for upload deals

229
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
as you can imagine

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
hacker will try to put its data when

231
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,120
uploading is authorized

232
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
so find upon this find openly here

233
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
because you can see all the files in it

234
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
you can use google but also various

235
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
total dual scan and so on there are a

236
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
lot of entry points to find

237
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
materials

238
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
and

239
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,720
go

240
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
you can even use artillery or

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
go back in time sometimes web servers

242
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,000
are not white it's just dns that are

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,959
unconfigured or you can still

244
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
get files with these little tricks with

245
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
a curl where you put the ip on the

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
hostname

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,360
of the web server

248
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,280
you can search

249
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,399
[Music]

250
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,880
like a bad guy he

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,079
imagine that you want to put a web shell

252
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
or attack file on a web server

253
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,839
you are lazy so you put only one one

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,880
character

255
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
on your file

256
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
so you you write

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
x php or cld.php or dt

258
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
you you understand

259
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,959
the id

260
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
or if you want to find fishing kits it's

261
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,880
easy

262
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
just try a paypal zip or bank

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
things like that

264
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,160
netflix bank of america

265
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
everything like that and you will find a

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
lot of fishing kits

267
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
let's

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
see example

269
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,519
this website

270
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,920
has a pix

271
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
directory and as you can see there are a

272
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
lot of files and some files doesn't look

273
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,000
like at all

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
as images

275
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,440
for example the dangshell.php.jpg

276
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
is really really suspicious

277
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
so

278
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
try to download it try to open it

279
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,360
i can say

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
obviously it's not a jpeg file

281
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
it's bhp code offensive and you can try

282
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,519
the other one

283
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,800
if you are a pen tester you know

284
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
those tricks in order to upload files uh

285
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
upload php files uh on prohibited

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
directories you will find some of them

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,079
the the file in gpeg on the bottom of

288
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,600
the screen

289
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,880
is suspicious too so

290
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,959
download those files read them

291
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,959
understand them and

292
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,279

that's

310
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,760
that could be useful for attackers

311
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,959
you can find

312
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,480
all old

320
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
execute command deface

321
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720

also answer so shall find out does it

326
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,639
mean you could inject

327
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,920
that that gives you

328
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,440
an idea of what what yours can do or are

329
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,880
trying to do

330
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
when you find

331
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
another website called netshell for this

332
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
one for emperor

333
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
i think undetectable

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
is not true because i found it

335
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,600
really really easily

336
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,560
if you see here you have a c99 you have

337
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,360
a

338
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,839
key for z php oop

339
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,160
dot php which is

340
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,200
other

341
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
file other attacker files

342
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,639
still

343
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,040
on top of it as you can see don't use it

350
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
well

351
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
that's fine

352
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:03,670
and

353
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,440
[Music]

354
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
you will find a lot of those files but

355
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,440
google

356
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,240
can be clever and google know the tricks

357
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,959
and

358
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,079
google

359
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
doesn't want to be used to find those

360
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,199
files

361
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,399
so

362
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,760
you will be

363
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
captured

364
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
you will see a lot a lot of capture

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,199
so

366
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,959
as an example

367
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
if you try web shell like that you will

368
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,639
get a capture uh immediately try the the

369
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,959
real name of the website not watching

370
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,000
and all of the so-called best dark of 20

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,160
20 20 21 you can find

372
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,760
if you found a

373
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
dork that you didn't invent

374
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
there is high probability that you won't

375
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,399
get any results or you will get some on

376
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,160
a part

377
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
you will get some

378
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
no answers and you use you can get

379
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
helipads

380
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
this is capture so those capture you

381
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
will have some

382
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
you will have to answer a lot a lot of

383
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,600
this

384
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,639
and

385
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,120
this is a hanapot

386
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,199
this is quickly

387
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
you can quickly find the season

388
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,560
honeypot because it has a lot of captcha

389
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
inside the file

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
the title is index of password

391
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
you can imagine and how you will try

392
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,279
that to find password but there is a

393
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,800
file type dot sql uh imural main the php

394
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
welcome to php i mean

395
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
russian uh

396
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
words uh mysql dump index of actually an

397
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
answer and so answer but

398
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
that's really a honeypot so don't click

399
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,639
on that you won't learn anything

400
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,519
some researcher that put this report

401
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
won't understand why you came here

402
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,320
and

403
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
once you have

404
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
access

405
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,639
you can boost

406
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
to find other other access because

407
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,759
usually

408
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,639
when a host web server is badly

409
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,079
configured

410
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,639
by gary's com but another badger can

411
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,720
come in and another one another one

412
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,959
on even sometimes on a cheap roster

413
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,759
all hosts are infected

414
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
if you can broad file system and find

415
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,279
logs

416
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,759
browse the logs and

417
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,399
grab grab the logs you will find other

418
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,800
wheelchairs

419
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,480
let's show an example

420
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,279
back in time in 2018 i found a

421
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,720
fish

422
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
about finos public which is the french

423
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,279
taxis

424
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
don't click on the under

425
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
the

426
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
directory because you won't pay your

427
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,240
taxes

428
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
that's not for that and

429
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,639
i went through a

430
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,320
dns

431
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,199
passive dns sites and i look all other

432
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,520
hosts which point to this

433
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,799
iphone one

434
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,119
which was called logged in which is

435
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,640
quite interesting

436
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
if you see what is in this login host

437
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,559
we find another files

438
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
one called luxes.php and if you look at

439
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,400
the timestamp the locks.php

440
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,839
it's

441
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,640
12 july 2018

442
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
and if you go back

443
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,880
you can see that the fishy of the

444
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
finos public was the 14th of july so

445
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,280
we can think that uh

446
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,919
the the battery came first in the 12th

447
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,000
of july and the

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
lux s php is

449
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,400
you you guess what

450
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
he's a webshare so

451
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,440
we can imagine that he put his watch

452
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,559
there and

453
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,120
after he begins to create a host

454
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,000
and

455
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,720
put all of its fishing

456
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,840
data

457
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,679
and

458
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
get its results and the the

459
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,559
the file the other file bbb.php

460
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,840
is yes it's another fishing for i i

461
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
forgot the

462
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,799
the website but it's another fishing

463
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
site

464
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
well quickly

465
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
quickly you can grab and you can store a

466
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
lot of these

467
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
pirate files pirate data and

468
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,720
this 1.5 gigabytes of data was scrapped

469
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,000
in around four weeks

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,720
of googling the download downloads and

471
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
googling again on downloads and get all

472
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
of this file

473
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
so that's really

474
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,240
quite a lot

475
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,200
a lot of files

476
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,240
now that we have all of those files

477
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,919
clearly we can analyze all of these

478
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
files and the oldest ones are paul but

479
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,720
that's

480
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
maybe i don't know 15 20 years ago

481
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,320
but were written in pearls they connect

482
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
to rhc networks but

483
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
they are not used anymore but it's uh

484
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,919
crazy that you can still find all of

485
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,200
those files

486
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,400
on web server you can find c99 dot php

487
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
webshell

488
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,559
but

489
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
they are quite old and they are not

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
really used anymore because they have

491
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,640
they lack

492
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
password protection

493
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,520
and

494
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
there are a lot of people who connect to

495
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
those

496
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
webshell on the destroy them or change

497
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,640
them or remove them

498
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,880
so today a lot a lot of web shells are

499
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
password protected

500
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,640
you have to find way to bring the

501
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
password or learn the password

502
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,600
but they can live longer because people

503
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
can't abuse them

504
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,160
and we can see more and more file

505
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,159
managers less and less web share and

506
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
more and more early file manager

507
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,320
more and more uh really really

508
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,720
minimalist webshell uh

509
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,039
sometimes it serves an uploader you just

510
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,480
can there are two files one up dot php

511
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
and unzip the php so you can upload

512
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
the

513
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,159
zip files and edit them on the reboot

514
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,200
as i said

515
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
you will find more and more password

516
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
protection

517
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
and if you look

518
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
in the in the data

519
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
yes it's

520
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
php php php

521
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
i have some

522
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,679
asp web share but really it's negligible

523
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,720
you have a lot a lot of php

524
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,440
that's a victim of choice for bad guys

525
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,039
and when you dig a little in the files

526
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
uh you have a lot of web shell uh

527
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,000
there are a lot of different wheelchair

528
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,280
as you saw in the print screen i uh show

529
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
you but there for each webshell you'll

530
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,440
have millions of copies

531
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,120
the bad guys usually change

532
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,439
that's all

533
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,919
they say it's our webshell

534
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,440
proud to play the sales product that but

535
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
if you give the files you have one line

536
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,360
or two line it's the title

537
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
strangely they change they like to

538
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,400
change the version so you have a website

539
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,000
0.4.3 and

540
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
when they change them they put the

541
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,120
version 3.0 so i don't know

542
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
that's not a real

543
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
upgrade but they like big number and

544
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
that's the same with the phishing kits

545
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
they are a lot copy-pasted uh one

546
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,919
through another one and with file

547
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,440
manager

548
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
on the passwords

549
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
used are

550
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
usually bad and

551
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,840
in the first part of this presentation i

552
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,919
told you about the password one two

553
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,679
three four five six

554
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
and for webshell

555
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,559
it's usually cracking

556
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,240
so if you have just one shot try

557
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,280
cracking

558
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
and

559
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,000
you have a probability that you get in

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,240
that i don't know why you're cracking

561
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
we can imagine because i like to crack

562
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
things but uh cracking

563
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,840
so

564
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,919
when you when you get

565
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,919
the php files uh

566
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,120
usually it's easy to find the password

567
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,280
because developer

568
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
sometimes put the password in clear so

569
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,360
as you can see in the first code snippet

570
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,679
the pass is hashed so

571
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
it's a md file

572
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,400
that's not a good hashing algorithm but

573
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,520
it's written

574
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
at the right so easy to

575
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,520
because

576
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
you had it so they didn't take time to

577
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
to calculate

578
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,039
the md5

579
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,200
they put the they put the feature

580
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
so good job guys but

581
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
i'm uh i mean

582
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,559
the third

583
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
quarter slipped this is a fun tool

584
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
because this one

585
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,679
i don't know why

586
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,559
you have a password field and

587
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,360
you have h1 with the password here

588
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,080
written h1 cracking so

589
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,480
yes you guess the you guess the password

590
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
you could put this password here and

591
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
getting really really easy

592
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
and

593
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
sometimes

594
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,679
you have some bug door in the in the

595
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
webshell so if you know the family it's

596
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,960
quite easy to get in without any

597
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
password

598
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
this one was fun

599
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,919
it's here

600
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
at first you have a path

601
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,200
you have to put the pass in the url but

602
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
if you don't have the pass the pass if

603
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,159
you just have a header http header l

604
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,520
called l

605
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
you are in

606
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,240
so this password protection is not

607
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
really really effective

608
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,240
and

609
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,200
as i said sometimes hackers are not

610
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
really good and

611
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
left a lot of tracks so they try to

612
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
upload x.php they failed so they try

613
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,000
x.php.txt

614
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,720
so just click on the x.php.txt and you

615
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,080
have the source code same as a jpeg for

616
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,639
answer advantage

617
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,640
so password protection

618
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
is not really really a problem

619
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,200
about

620
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,960
about the use of

621
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
that

622
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,520
this is

623
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,840
this was a

624
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,159
fishing the official get a

625
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,960
tefl number the credit card

626
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,840
expiration date

627
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,440
and everything

628
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,159
and it was

629
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,640
normally uh it

630
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,720
should be sent by email

631
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,880
and i think that the developer of the

632
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
phishing kit put a really clear message

633
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,679
here uh

634
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
here with comments on the people who

635
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
were

636
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
using this

637
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
this fishing kit

638
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,960
didn't understand

639
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,279
that and didn't change anything and this

640
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,559
was a total failure i think

641
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,840
because this email doesn't exist

642
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,879
a that's also fun

643
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
and

644
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,919
about the millions of a copy of the web

645
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,039
shell

646
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,080
coding a real web shell could be hard

647
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,279
so

648
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,480
people copy copy paste reuse them

649
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,440
and

650
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
be careful because webshell

651
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,919
are backdoor

652
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,080
i've seen webshell backdoor twice

653
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
on even back door in the back door so

654
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,080
i have a lot of questions about that why

655
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
why do you back door back door

656
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,960
what it's for what's the use for that

657
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,200
how how do you see it's a backdoor

658
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,039
because on the webshell you have a lot

659
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,600
of php stuff and you have a string long

660
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,279
string

661
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,440
basics for the code and in this long

662
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
string if you look on the php code

663
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,760
you can see that

664
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,720
this sends the host the password on the

665
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,840
url where the webshell is so it means

666
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,320
that anybody which copy this web share

667
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,880
put that on your new web server

668
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,919
email is sent to another person telling

669
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,440
and telling him that the website has

670
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,320
been deployed somewhere so he can go

671
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,520
back steal the webshell

672
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,679
too bad too bad for them

673
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
but uh

674
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,799
are those bad guys really lame in

675
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,559
security uh

676
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
not at all they get they get better and

677
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,320
better uh

678
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,919
slowly better

679
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,799
undergone as i said back in time they

680
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,000
weren't any password today they put some

681
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,799
password and they use certain techniques

682
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,039
they use a lot of htaccess files

683
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,320
a

684
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,880
file is called antibots

685
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
they can send a fake four for pages they

686
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,919
check some headers sometimes

687
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,240
they put booster to throw you away if

688
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,919
you don't have

689
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,360
some data or some variables

690
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,799
they learned

691
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,080
about scrambling php obfuscation

692
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,440
and all of this that's not uh

693
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,679
obfuscation it's not really efficient

694
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,440
but you just have to be motivated

695
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
this is an example

696
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
this is an anti-crawler because the i

697
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
think the guy don't want to be uh

698
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,080
to be crawled by a google under the butt

699
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
if he detects in the in the user agent

700
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,440
here in the user agent he just send said

701
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
44. and with a nice message for people

702
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
unfold the

703
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,039
empty

704
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,320
files and

705
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
see something

706
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,880
this one has eight different files based

707
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,799
on the same id

708
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,679
all of those ips are a banner and you

709
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,760
can connect if you can form one of those

710
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,158
ips

711
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
another one with another nice

712
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
nice nice crude

713
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
language crude message for people

714
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,840
who looks at it

715
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,559
sometimes it's also fun with a

716
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,639
nice ascii art i like it

717
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,320
and the htaccess files

718
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
are sometimes small sometimes really

719
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
really big uh that's usually a

720
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
concatenation of many htaccess files

721
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,240
that's poor quality uh

722
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,279
they're even false but the comments can

723
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,200
be really fun

724
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
when you see leecher or i don't like you

725
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,200
he's not sure if it's nsai or google but

726
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,919
he blocked it anyway

727
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,960
and

728
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
the best defense

729
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
those

730
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
those people have

731
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
is a password

732
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,559
yes and back in time sometimes you could

733
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
find those

734
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,440
really really minimalist webshell

735
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,480
the first one you just system the cmd

736
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,159
parameter

737
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,000
so if you uh

738
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
so like

739
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,799
if you found

740
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,039
a small file called z.php or x.php with

741
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,720
a very very little size and when you

742
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,559
click on it you don't have any output

743
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,600
try a cmd equals ls and if you have an

744
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,720
output

745
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
that's it

746
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
but more and more

747
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,679
today they use that this uh this little

748
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,679
trick very very effective

749
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,320
if you don't know the uh

750
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
the first get variable on the post name

751
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,240
uh you can choose it you can't abuse it

752
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,640
on the it's from them so even if you own

753
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,120
one you can choose another

754
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,399
another website

755
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,240
on it's

756
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
bad for us

757
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,960
to see what they are doing

758
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
but

759
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
we can

760
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,320
question ourselves how how did they come

761
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,039
in

762
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
at first place sometimes it's really

763
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,080
easy

764
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
it's only yes because we don't make a

765
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,600
digital for incident weapons

766
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
sometimes it's really easy you have a

767
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,480
vulnerable stuff a really really old

768
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,440
wordpress website a website with an auto

769
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,039
frontier but

770
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,440
sometimes it's harder

771
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,600
because you don't have really

772
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,039
a lot of settings so we can guess it's

773
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,720
ssh broad force

774
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,120
maybe use a host when you have visual

775
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,440
hosting or any other vector unknown

776
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
but we don't

777
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
we we won't make

778
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,519
an incident response to learn

779
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,799
why and how they came

780
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,760
i

781
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,080
during during all of the scrapping

782
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,880
sometimes you can hold in real time

783
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,000
hackers

784
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
and badgers

785
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,880
entering a machine so let's see

786
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,200
what happens on a

787
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,080
hacked

788
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
web server and

789
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,320
i was lucky because i had a file manager

790
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
and a host and this file manager was

791
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,440
able to

792
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,519
read all of the files on other host so

793
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,559
i saw a day the first day

794
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,960
somebody putting a windows malware with

795
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
a low score on various total and each

796
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,039
morning for a week

797
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,840
there was a was a new

798
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,320
exe files exe file put on that host

799
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,720
and each morning uh

800
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,360
i

801
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,840
i checked it on a various hotel and it

802
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,159
was a very very low score on the uh in

803
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,200
the evening

804
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
the score

805
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,080
slowly was rising up so antivirus

806
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,039
did as a job and i think that each day

807
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
the

808
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
malware author

809
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,360
recompiles or change a little bit on its

810
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,080
malware to remain undetectable

811
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,519
and

812
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,600
he stayed quiet another time and we have

813
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,559
a

814
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,799
fishing campaign quite successful there

815
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,600
were

816
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,399
some hits in this season campaign

817
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,600
and the the next day it was another

818
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,200
campaign

819
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,679
which had no hits at all

820
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,159
and after that it was a chaos total

821
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,240
cures

822
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,159
a lot of directories

823
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,360
were

824
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,679
treated a lot of fish kids

825
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,039
half installed handmade it was a

826
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,960
horrific

827
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,840
on

828
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,679
the the day 15 everything was wiped and

829
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,600
the same day after the wipe the web

830
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,919
server was deactivated

831
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,320
i think that

832
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,600
the the

833
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,799
at first badly from that use it for

834
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,840
something

835
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,080
and

836
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,039
he

837
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,159
shared

838
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,840
this web server and

839
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,399
i think he shared a webserver on a forum

840
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,320
and everybody came in and everybody did

841
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
bad things and the admin saw all of

842
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,039
these traffic and he trashed everything

843
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,600
about those

844
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,919
you can find a lot of fish kits

845
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
sometimes they are

846
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,519
not configured

847
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,360
sometimes are trojanized

848
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
sometimes you can find the results

849
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,240
on the server so anybody can afford all

850
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,079
of the credit cards all of the email all

851
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,800
of the passwords sometimes no result

852
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,280
i think this is

853
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
this is a

854
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
different economy i think that people

855
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,440
makes money by selling phishing kits

856
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
instead of making money by using

857
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
efficient kits

858
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,079
and

859
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,079
sometimes you cannot find that so i

860
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,399
blurred the text files because with that

861
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,918
name you can find all of those text

862
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:30,719
files

863
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,440
and

864
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040

fishing kit it's always the same but

898

if you cook enough sometimes you see all

899
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,040
the hits and it can be fun to watch

900
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
that

901
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,680
and

902
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,400
when you find fish kids sometimes

903
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,079
sometimes

904
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,920
really often you find

905
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
all of the family of mirai gav gates and

906
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,440
so on

907
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,520
you have all of those bots

908
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,359
you can download them you can retouch

909
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,480
them

910
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
see what's happening here you can follow

911
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
the cnc

912
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,440
uh

913
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
that

914
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,800
the 22 but uh

915
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,920
quickly quickly uh it's not fun anymore

916
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,200
and

917
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,440
exceptionally once in a while you can

918
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,920
find a real new malware variant with

919
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
stream code

920
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,200
i found a

921
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
not so fun

922
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,320
really really interesting

923
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,599
file

924
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,680
i found only one blog

925
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,599
telling it was trailblast but

926
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,000
maybe maybe not and it was really really

927
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,640
well hidden

928
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
sometimes you can find wait files

929
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,680
with the timestamp

930
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,440
when

931
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,560
wordpress theme is uploaded all the all

932
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,119
the date is the same if one date

933
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,200
if one timestamp is different

934
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,079
it's

935
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,119
look look at it but for this one

936
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,200
it was a full wordpress time uploaded so

937
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,640
no timestamp

938
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
the php code is

939
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,880
is well hidden

940
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
and the md5 password

941
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,160
is used as a seed so as you can see

942
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
this is the this is the file

943
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,920
at first

944
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,040
nothing

945
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
nothing weird

946
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,079
it's called two bar

947
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,440
api wp admin bar you need something like

948
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,200
that but if you go a little deeper

949
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,550
you'll find that so

950
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,839
[Music]

951
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
let's start with the with the last line

952
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,359
it's wp key says data it's a real

953
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,480
wordpress

954
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,520
variable

955
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
it's a bit longer so it's a strange and

956
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,640
if you look

957
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,200
this function pre edit bar

958
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,240
key says

959
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,680
string

960
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,920
md5 but

961
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,240
base64 decode that's that's suspicious

962
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,960
the

963
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,000
gz inflate is really really suspicious

964
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,800
and

965
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,000
if you

966
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,839
take the time to analyze this function

967
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,400
uh it will it will use the password to

968
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,560
decrypt this file and exit exactly the

969
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,320
php code

970
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,160
i try to break force

971
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
the password without

972
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,560
luck at the moment so i really don't

973
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,320
know what the what this file is doing

974
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,240
and i'm not working on it

975
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,000
so

976
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,760
you found

977
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,400
[Music]

978
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
those warning admits works sometimes in

979
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,839
the same mail when it's obvious or

980
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,480
really really nasty and

981
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,800
i think i can count on one hand the

982
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,000
answers

983
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,880
the

984
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,760
i have a case where uh i received an

985
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,040
email three years after sending uh the

986
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,320
warning email

987
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,520
on the the who said thank you but

988
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,640
yeah

989
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,760
three years

990
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
that's a lot of time

991
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
but

992
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
if you look more closely when you send

993
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,480
an email sometimes you don't have

994
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,160
answers but the files disappear so i

995
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,599
think it's a good one

996
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,640
and

997
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,880
if you try to look uh

998
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,119
at who are they

999
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,599
i use the word badgers a lot in this

1000
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,800
presentation

1001
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,359
so who are those bad guys

1002
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,200
i think there are many they use cheat

1003
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
techniques

1004
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,000
but as long as it works

1005
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,599
they will continue

1006
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,240
to attack web servers they will continue

1007
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,160
just because you know it works it's

1008
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,880
effective and i said at first they don't

1009
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
host anything

1010
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,680
so

1011
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
they continue

1012
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,480
and

1013
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,079
if you are an admin

1014
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,359
as usual it's always the same ideas

1015
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,760
terminate whatever

1016
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,119
b password

1017
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,880
ask for an audit transfer etcetera

1018
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,720
etcetera etcetera and

1019
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,040
there are a lot of very very good

1020
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,560
examples of if you have a web server try

1021
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,160
this

1022
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,119
grep

1023
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,359
and if you have results

1024
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,960
on this regex

1025
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,359
i have bad news for you because

1026
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,280
it's 99 sure that it's an evil file and

1027
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,119
you have to to

1028
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,680
earn it

1029
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,599
and to conclude

1030
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,680
this presentation is there a turning

1031
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,640
point

1032
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
i think

1033
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,800
yes landscape is evolving

1034
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,560
there are less and less personal web

1035
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,800
server on the internet

1036
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,079
there are a lot

1037
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,400
more facebook pages

1038
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,440
host website as i showed at first the

1039
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,599
restaurant hosting its

1040
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,520
blog and its

1041
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,000
website doesn't really exist anymore

1042
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,079
anymore maybe there are

1043
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,280
less and less php on the internet and

1044
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,400
i think that

1045
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,079
pirates are better at hiding there a lot

1046
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,640
of exposure there are a lot of tractors

1047
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,560
a website they say the url scan barista

1048
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,280
a lot of personal trackers or people who

1049
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
follow bots who follow attackers so i

1050
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,640
think they learn to hide

1051
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,839
and

1052
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,520
they stay

1053
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,400
i think no less time

1054
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,079
active

1055
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,160
and

1056
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
don't get

1057
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,599
to the false idea that attackers are

1058
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,000
lame uh

1059
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,200
you find the lamest they are

1060
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,079
a lot you will find them a lot but the

1061
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,160
the good one and the better one are

1062
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,520
really really hard to take

1063
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
google

1064
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,079
helps you to find all of those people

1065
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,920
and

1066
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,079
google fights you

1067
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,160
by blacklisting all of the words all of

1068
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,599
your dogs slowly so it's hard

1069
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,680
to find them and for a final word

1070
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,200
i'm not a lawyer

1071
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,240
i don't think that bad girl will sue you

1072
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,319
because you use the web shell

1073
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,520
but it may be illegal to do this so

1074
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,640
used or used challenging live mode

1075
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,599
laptop

1076
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,280
and

1077
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,200

1081
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
