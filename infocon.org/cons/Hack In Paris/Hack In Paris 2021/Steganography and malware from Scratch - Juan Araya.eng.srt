1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,560
hola my name is

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,240
my cyber squishy specialist and today

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,440
i'm going to talk about a segment of

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,679
malware from scratch

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,759
so a little bit about me

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
and as i said my name is i'm a cloud

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,040
security architect i have a baseline

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
degree in computer science in this case

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,800
from the university of costa rica i have

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
a master in cyber security down there

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
you can see you can find my linkedin

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
profile in case you want to add me as a

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,680
contact and i'll be more than glad to

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,560
interact with each and every one of you

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
from the recent certification these are

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,719
some of my most recent certifications

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,640
especially the comptia

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
certified advanced security practitioner

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,840
i'm now getting is specialized in cloud

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079
technology like edwards and

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
asia so little belittle as you know we

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
are in an area where we cannot stop you

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
know studying so we need to continue

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,719
enhancing our knowledge so that's why a

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,160
little by little i'm trying to get as

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
much certifications as possible and to

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
continue setting because that's the way

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
that's the only way to keep

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,359
our knowledge up to date

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,480
all right so

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
enough about me so let's go straight to

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,000
the point about the stegorophone malware

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
from scratch so this is agenda so first

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
i'm going to talk about what is malware

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
then we will know we will i'll share

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
information about the steganography what

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,119
it is

38
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,479
of course the secondary don't get me

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
wrong stegorophone is not bad at all you

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
know it has been used for legitimate

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,400
purposes for example for copyright

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
protection but also can be used to hide

43
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
information can be used to steal data

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,880
can be used to send payloads and many

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,320
other stuff

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,520
so that's why

47
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
after i share information about what is

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
stegorophy i'll talk about a stack word

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
where in a statement we're gonna use

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
steganography techniques to again hide

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,360
data steal information send payloads and

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,600
many other malicious uh

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,640
actions

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
and of course at the end i'm gonna talk

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,159
about security measures you know some

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,079
recommendations that will

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
protect your company will protect your

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
data against attacks using statwear

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
so let's talk before i go to stagware

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
and and stegonerf it is important to

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
clarify what is malware so malware

62
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
stands for malicious software it is

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
designed to steal data to affect the

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
confidentiality of the data in other

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
words to be able to access data that you

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
are not authorized to be able to damage

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
you know temporary database to alter

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
data so that's in other words to affect

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
integ integrity of the information and

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,840
finally to affect the availability of

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,599
the service for example to send a lot of

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
requests that will overwhelm a server

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
and will cause a denial of service

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
attack

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
so what which are the most common type

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
of malware that are

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
down there at the jungle of the internet

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
so let's talk about one of the most the

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
most simple in this case would be a

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
trojan a trojan is a software that it

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
looks like a legitimate software looks

82
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
like a legitimate application

83
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
application for example you download a

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
um

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
a version from microsoft that you didn't

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,319
pay right

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,200
and

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
of course it will work but you know that

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
microsoft products in this case

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
microsoft office is not for free

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,159
so

92
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,599
people that wants to um do illegal stuff

93
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,840
like using you know

94
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
a software without the proper license

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,599
sometimes they

96
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
fall in this is in this situation and

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,599
they start using application that looks

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,159
like legitimate they start using

99
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
a fake version of a or you know a tamper

100
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
version of a windows or

101
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,519
even a free game

102
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
so they look legitimate and these type

103
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,760
of trojan applications are not only

104
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
available for you know desktop computers

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
or server computers of course in in the

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,799
apple store in the play store you know

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,280
in android devices there are many

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,599
applications that looks legitimate but

109
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,720
are not

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
so what what is what what could go wrong

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
so for example when you open up one of

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
these applications

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
yeah and at the same time that you're

114
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
able to use it you know as the way it is

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
supposed to do it it could especially

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
easily i'm sorry it could easily start

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
contacting you know the attacker could

118
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,480
easily start trying to steal information

119
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,959
he could try to download a keylogger you

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
know which is another type of malware or

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
talk in a few minutes or

122
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,720
or why not you know maybe download a

123
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,319
worm that will

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,680
try to distribute a ransomware okay

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
so the other type of malware that is

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,399
very common nowadays would be a bot

127
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,199
so

128
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
what is a bot a bot would be a computer

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,320
that has been infected or compromised

130
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
we normally call this type of computer

131
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
that once it is one it has been

132
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
compromised we call it a zombie computer

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
why because it will start receiving

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
instructions remotely from the attacker

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
how is it going to start receiving those

136
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
type of instructions normally the

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
attacker is going to configure something

138
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,400
that is known as a command and control

139
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
so the command control will start you

140
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
know pinging and contacting the

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,600
different compromised computers to

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
verify if they're still compromised and

143
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,520
detector is going to send an instruction

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
to the command and control for example

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
try to connect to this specific website

146
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
so maybe the website is assigned to a

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
managed and i don't know like i said an

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,840
example like 1 000 requests per hour and

149
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
suddenly it received like 100 million of

150
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,280
requests

151
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
so of course the server is not ready to

152
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
manage that type of workload and it will

153
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
cause a develop service so that is one

154
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
of the many uses

155
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
that you can implement using a bot

156
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
in this case

157
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
the

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
um the group of bots is known as a

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
botnet so

160
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
once you are able to control the button

161
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
you can use it for causing develop

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
service you can use it to try over and

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,560
over

164
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
maybe some credentials that has been

165
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
sent that has been instilled previously

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
so you can try to perform an attack

167
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
account a cover attack and many others

168
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
the other type of malware that nowadays

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
is very very dangerous would be a worm

170
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
why because a worm is designed to

171
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,479
automatically copy itself once it

172
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,240
detects that that that and the specific

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,639
vulnerability is present for example

174
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
there's a missing patch on some servers

175
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
okay so once you detect that there's a

176
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
missing patch on those servers it will

177
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
try to copy it automatically and once it

178
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
copied automatically it will infect that

179
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,199
computer and it will download for

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
example a ransomware

181
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,479
and that's the next one so the run

182
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,400
server will be a type of mod were

183
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,759
designed to encrypt the data and steal

184
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,800
the data

185
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
and so the

186
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,479
victim in this case is not going to be

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,800
longer able to read to have access to

188
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
their information their files

189
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,759
many companies are not ready to to

190
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
detect and they are not ready to survive

191
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,080
after a ransomware attack they don't

192
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,479
have like an incident management plan

193
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,360
they

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
they are their backups are not performed

195
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,759
properly they don't test their backups

196
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
and so on so that's why attackers in

197
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
that case once they are able to encrypt

198
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,800
the data they send some ransom notes

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
asking okay if you pay me this amount of

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
money then maybe i will return your

201
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,440
files you know but there's no guarantee

202
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
you know nobody's going to guarantee

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
that you're going to receive the data

204
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,720
without any

205
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
with without any a malware inside your

206
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,000
they don't guarantee that they already

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,319
they didn't already copy that that

208
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
information right and they already

209
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
distributed in on the deep web you know

210
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
with other criminals

211
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
so my suggestion at this point is

212
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,319
remember to not pay do not pay

213
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,199
whatever is asked on a ransomware attack

214
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,680
okay so get ready prepare your incident

215
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,599
management plan have a good backups and

216
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
many other stuff that i'll share at the

217
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,080
end of this this presentation but

218
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
transformer is a big thing so an equal

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,639
and it could affect anybody at any

220
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,919
moment

221
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,759
the other type of malware is known as

222
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
adware the adword is designed to earn

223
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,880
money

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,240
in an illegal way using a legal process

225
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
in other words there are some companies

226
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
that are willing to pay

227
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
if you're able to up you know to obtain

228
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,560
new users new customers you know to

229
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
access their website so they have like a

230
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,599
paper paper clicking a program so some

231
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
attackers will will

232
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
infect computers and those computers

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
will simulate those clicks

234
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
and the attacker will earn money the

235
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
company will start paying thinking that

236
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,319
they are

237
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,000
getting new and new customers but at the

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
end they are not really new customers

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,240
they are simulated customers

240
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
the next one would be in this case a

241
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
spyware the spyware would be a type of

242
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,759
malware as the way it says that is

243
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
assigned to spy to know whatever to

244
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
record whatever you a

245
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
type you know in this case all your

246
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,720
keystrokes are going to be register

247
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,879
the attacker could have access to your

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,640
video camera you know

249
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,440
so

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
that could affect you know privacy that

251
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
could affect for example with the key

252
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,479
logger they will be able to obtain your

253
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,159
username and password of your bank and

254
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,120
then perform wire transfer and so on

255
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,040
there are other type of a

256
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,880
malware in this case these two are very

257
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
similar but this one is a very

258
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
interesting one so this is a virus as

259
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
you know which is a malicious server

260
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
that is assigned to copy automatically

261
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,399
for example once you

262
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
infect a usb key and you connect the usb

263
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
key to a computer it will automatically

264
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
when the using the auto run option it

265
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
will copy automatically to the target

266
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
computer right and it will

267
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
execute whatever it is it is assigned to

268
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
you know damage information download

269
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
more malware whatever

270
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,880
now there's another type of virus in

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
this case the armor virus that is that

272
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
is a polyformic

273
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,839
virus that also has encryption and

274
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,040
obfuscation so the idea is to make

275
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
really hard or harder you know the

276
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,440
process of reverse engineering

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,240
so that way for the people that are

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
there to protect will be a lot harder to

279
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,440
understand what the valuer does you know

280
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
what the programming language it was to

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
use what libraries it is using you know

282
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,839
there's no semantic there's no easy to

283
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
read you know names

284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
uh to that help us recognize you know

285
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,519
what the attacker was thinking when he

286
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,519
designed the malware

287
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,320
now

288
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
malware doesn't have to be something

289
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,000
like a very complicated you know people

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
think that malware is designed by genius

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
you know by very smart people

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
well not really

293
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,360
malware could be as easy as a um you

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
know malicious code

295
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
that is written in visual basic for

296
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
application in vba it can also be part

297
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,519
of a very simple javascript it could

298
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,240
also be you know designed using python

299
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
in many programming language many

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
options so you don't have to be like

301
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
like a genius to be able to create your

302
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,839
own malware of course there are some

303
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
advanced malware and those are the zero

304
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,800
day attacks you know that are

305
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
continually trying to develop more

306
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
malware that that

307
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,079
are not already documented and there's

308
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,800
no at that particular point of point of

309
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,399
time there was no defense mechanism

310
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,120
so

311
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
this is just an example of a very simple

312
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
malware that you can even try to

313
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,839
you do yourself you know from the

314
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,600
education perspective so for example

315
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,279
this is uh excel with macro enable excel

316
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
so on this excel um

317
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
in this case would be like an invoice

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
you know maybe someone could receive an

319
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
email saying uh this is a impul invoice

320
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
template designed for small and medium

321
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
business

322
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,320
um this is for free and this and it has

323
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
the logo of the government and so on you

324
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,440
know to

325
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,720
you know to to

326
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,760
facilitate the process of task tax

327
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,720
income

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920
generation and registration all right

329
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
so at the point that someone open up

330
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,079
this malware as you can see in this

331
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
excel file it will it will contain some

332
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
malicious code

333
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
so for example down here you can see

334
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
as soon as the person open up this excel

335
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
file it's going to call the redirect

336
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
function the redirect

337
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
function in this case it's going to

338
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
perform these actions it's gonna just

339
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,279
open up one website this is a very

340
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
simple example of course

341
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
it could do many other things it could

342
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
download a malware it could start you

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
know still information and upload the

344
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
data in ftp into an ftp server and many

345
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,920
other things

346
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
in this order example i'm saying for

347
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
example once the person resize the

348
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
windows of the excel file you know make

349
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
it bigger or smaller then it's going to

350
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,240
call this other function you know the

351
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,880
finger print os powershell

352
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
so this fingerprint os powershell is

353
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,040
going to run at a terminal and it's

354
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,959
going to execute powershell and it's

355
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,959
going to obtain information about the

356
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,360
version of the operating system

357
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,399
right and finally on this order example

358
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
i'm going to run a choral command using

359
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,639
the terminal once again as soon as the

360
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,920
person types a value on a specific cell

361
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
you know once it's the value of that

362
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
cell change it's going to call the

363
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,519
terminal function and then it's going to

364
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
run a shell command to

365
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,000
connect a via curl to a specific website

366
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
this is another example of a very simple

367
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
malware once again this case will be

368
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
with javascript nowadays many um for

369
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
example on facebook you see people that

370
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
are offering things and they say okay

371
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
the first 10 people that register on

372
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
this website will

373
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
obtain i don't know a scholarship or

374
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
they will obtain a free iphone or

375
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,279
whatever right they use social

376
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
engineering techniques like

377
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,600
causing you know a scarcity or trying to

378
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
make people think that it's normal that

379
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
it's gonna it's a bit of a big

380
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
opportunity and so on so on this

381
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,959
particular example then here i create

382
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,920
just a cool google form as you can see

383
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,600
it is supposed to be for someone who

384
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
wants a scholarship with a big discount

385
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
of 20 percent of the total cost it

386
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
requires some basic data

387
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,720
but

388
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
again

389
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
in the back end it's gonna if it's gonna

390
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
have a script in this case using google

391
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,120
forms there's a script editor and a

392
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,639
script editor you can write you know

393
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
code that it could be designed you know

394
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
for good or for that in this case would

395
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,240
be just to open up the

396
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,839
specific website

397
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,440
um without you know the human

398
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,519
interaction as soon as they start

399
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,600
working on this form

400
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
in parallel this tab will be will be

401
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,240
open and it's going to close you know

402
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,880
automatically

403
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
now how malware can be distributed so

404
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
there are many techniques in this case

405
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,199
using social engineering techniques to

406
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
try to motivate people to open up these

407
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
type of malicious files or to try to

408
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
access malicious hyperlinks for example

409
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,320
one of them is submission in this case

410
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
they are sending text text message

411
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
it through even a social media like i

412
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,920
don't know like whatsapp or

413
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
a facebook or whatever

414
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,600
so they use social engineering

415
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,079
techniques to try to motivate people to

416
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,000
once again download or click on those

417
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
hyperlinks

418
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
another technique is known as phishing

419
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
in this case they're going to send tons

420
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,519
and tons of emails you know to multiple

421
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,399
people

422
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,399
um you know once again they could use

423
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,920
the logo of a specific company the even

424
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,160
the the letters will look like very

425
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
similar to the one that is official

426
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
under that are in the official website

427
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
uh and it will try to have a pretext to

428
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
motivate people to do something okay and

429
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,959
another one this is a very a funny one

430
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,079
you know i don't know if you like you

431
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,040
know mr road but in the mr robot series

432
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,320
they talk about

433
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
uh a rubber ducky so basically it's a

434
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
usb key you know this usb key they are

435
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
going to inject a virus and this virus

436
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
is going to and the autorun function is

437
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
going to copy automatically once they

438
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
connect these type of devices

439
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
so for example in pen test penetration

440
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,560
testing efforts it's very common that in

441
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
engineers you know they design this type

442
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
this type of attacks you know for good

443
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
to verify if some employees will fall on

444
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
that trick and they will connect this

445
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,079
type of devices directly to the computer

446
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,959
of the

447
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,040
of the company

448
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
now as you can see on this specific

449
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,160
examples we need to send some we need to

450
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
prepare a file right that file needs to

451
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
be downloaded that file needs to be

452
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
executed now there are other ways to

453
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,000
distribute malware in this case

454
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
we are talking about fileless malware

455
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,920
using living of the land techniques in

456
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
this case using binaries that already

457
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
exist on the operating system using the

458
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,959
scripts that already exist on the

459
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,480
operating system

460
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
and they are using good tools you know

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,839
in this case ole mi which is a windows

462
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,519
management instrumentation system you

463
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,959
know there is in powershell which is

464
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,320
very good you know with powershell you

465
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,560
can do automation you can

466
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
improve the maintenance of your

467
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,839
equipment

468
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
um you can connect you know with the

469
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
active directory for user reconciliation

470
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
with exchange whatever right it's a very

471
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,959
very powerful and of course with the

472
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,240
cloud

473
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
now also with the terminal you know with

474
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
the terminal you can configure in a job

475
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,440
you know with the task scheduler to for

476
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
example to coordinate backups so there

477
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
are

478
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,120
three basic examples of how you can use

479
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
these

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
tools for good however you can use them

481
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,360
for performing a malware

482
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
a fileless malware attack so what is the

483
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
idea down here the idea is to try to

484
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
execute malicious software without being

485
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
installed

486
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
trying to execute malicious commands

487
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,279
that are going to be executed directly

488
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,399
in memory

489
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,320
they are not going to affect the os they

490
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,959
are not going to affect the um the hard

491
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,720
drive right everything is going to be on

492
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,439
memory directly this is a very

493
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,079
interesting example this is me is was

494
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,319
used using elk framework

495
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,039
so with elk framework it works very very

496
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,959
interesting so the attacker is gonna in

497
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,599
this case is gonna prepare a payload and

498
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,559
it's going to upload the payload in a

499
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,119
popular in this case um

500
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,439
a cloud-based uh software as a service

501
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,000
solution okay

502
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
so this cloud-based beam

503
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
yes so far as the service solution is

504
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
designed for people you know to interact

505
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
to share files at the same time you know

506
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,080
to

507
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,799
concurrently work on the same same file

508
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,919
and work together okay now the idea down

509
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
here is the following so the attacker

510
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,679
once he uploads the the payload

511
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,600
he's gonna try to use social engineering

512
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
to motivate someone to do something this

513
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
case will motivate someone to run some

514
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,679
specific commands on their computer you

515
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,360
know maybe they are going they simulate

516
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,520
that these commands are are going to

517
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,600
block in a specific vulnerability try to

518
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
implement them as soon as possible right

519
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
someone is going to go down there

520
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,400
somebody's going to copy and paste them

521
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,880
on a terminal just as an example

522
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,799
so what is going to happen at that point

523
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,080
the payload in this case is designed to

524
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,799
a i'm sorry the commands are designed

525
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,039
to in this case connect to the software

526
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
as a service solution

527
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
it's not going to download it's going to

528
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,280
read

529
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,080
the data the malicious commands that are

530
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,679
uploaded in the cloud

531
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,000
and then it's going to execute

532
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
those malicious commands that regular

533
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,640
memory without installing okay

534
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,440
so

535
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
when for example those commands could be

536
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,760
designed to enable the attacker to have

537
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,679
shell access using a reverse shell so in

538
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,280
this case attacker

539
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
when he create or he or she you know

540
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
develop

541
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
and upload the payload at that very

542
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,760
moment this person can also prepare the

543
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,039
his computer or his equipment to

544
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
have a port open

545
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
ready to listen on that port

546
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,039
for incoming connections in this case

547
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
for a reversal connection so that the

548
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
victim is going to connect to the

549
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,760
computer of the attacker on a specific

550
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
port and that at that point the attacker

551
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,000
is going to have shell access so once

552
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,919
attacker have shell access it will be

553
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
just a matter of time to start losing

554
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
your files to start losing control of

555
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
your computer

556
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
and many other bad things could happen

557
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
now let's talk a little bit about about

558
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,480
the same graphics so steganography for

559
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,640
me is a very interesting technique

560
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
this phrase is a very famous phrase from

561
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
margaret in divalu excuse me i'm sorry

562
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,840
for my pronunciation unfortunately my

563
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,320
french is not very good however this

564
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
phrase is very good it says the more

565
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
hitting the venom the more dangerous it

566
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
is and that's exactly what a stenography

567
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
is designed for

568
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
the idea is to try to send messages the

569
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
idea is to try to send payloads they

570
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,559
also try to send malicious code

571
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,760
without being detected

572
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,760
so this is not new this has been used

573
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,400
for for ages for example

574
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
a long time ago you know

575
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,679
there was this slave that the

576
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,679
they they they use this slave as a

577
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,240
carrier you know they decide okay let's

578
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,039
send a message let's write a message in

579
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,240
a tattoo

580
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,120
in the

581
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
in the head of this person

582
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,480
okay so they shave his head they wrote

583
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
the two they waited the hair came back

584
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,760
and then they sent the slave to percy

585
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,159
at the other side there was this person

586
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,559
waiting for this slave he knew that he

587
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,640
was supposed to shave his head

588
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,360
to

589
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
knew the secret message once he shaved

590
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,400
his head the method was to coordinate an

591
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
attack against percy

592
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,520
all right

593
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,320
for example in the second world war

594
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
there was this micro dots you know on

595
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,080
pictures

596
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,720
that contains text

597
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,600
so

598
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
only those that knew

599
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
were to find on those pictures data and

600
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
and have a way to magnify to see the

601
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
data they will be able to see the secret

602
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
message

603
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
then of course when we were kids we

604
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
always play around you know with the

605
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,840
invisible ink you know using a lemon or

606
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,720
things like that so this is also a very

607
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,440
simple example of our instagraphy

608
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,120
and nowadays the stegography has been

609
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,919
used

610
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
not only just for sending messages but

611
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
it's been used to send payloads to steal

612
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,360
information it's been used by the

613
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
terrorist attacks you know terrorist

614
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
groups to communicate between each other

615
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
without being tracked or without being

616
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,320
detected

617
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,840
so for example

618
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
everybody likes to share you know funny

619
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
pictures on their social media right on

620
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
whatsapp or facebook or any of this

621
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
the problem down there is that we don't

622
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
know who designed these memories we

623
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
don't know who who

624
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,240
if inside these members are some hidden

625
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
information or there's a payload so

626
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
there's a risk a really high risk of

627
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,640
being sharing of sharing continuously

628
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
this type of data once again because we

629
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
don't know if it has inside any

630
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,480
malicious code

631
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,400
now what could go wrong you know the

632
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
attacker could be able to steal personal

633
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
identifiable information they could be

634
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
able to

635
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,760
download you know have some commands

636
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
that if he has if he has a way to

637
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,039
extract the commands that is hidden the

638
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,760
pictures he will be able to convert your

639
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,480
computer in a bot once again your bot

640
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,559
will communicate with a camera control

641
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,240
once the attacker has access to your

642
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
computer and has full control of your

643
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,679
computer your computer will become a

644
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,159
zombie and your computer will be part of

645
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,280
a botnet

646
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,679
all right the your the picture could

647
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,400
have a hyperlink for example

648
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200
of a malicious code of a hyperlink that

649
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,280
has malicious information

650
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,159
or

651
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
they don't sometimes they

652
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
they just want to play a little bit

653
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
smarter so they don't want to modify at

654
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,520
all the picture

655
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,039
they will just

656
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,440
alter the values on the metadata

657
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
remember that the metadata will be some

658
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
attributes some

659
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,559
attributes that you know represent the

660
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,240
picture for example it says the what

661
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,320
camera was used when the picture was

662
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,440
taken the geolocation so there are some

663
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,039
text fields

664
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
that every picture has

665
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
and every file has so they can

666
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
hide those type of commands in the

667
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
metadata

668
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
once again the idea is to send in this

669
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,600
case messages or commands hidden in a

670
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,400
carrier option

671
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
so what could go wrong with the scenario

672
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
with the improper usage of a secondary

673
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,480
it could be used to seal information and

674
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
you know that once information is still

675
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
there's an information a security breach

676
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
the reputation of many companies will go

677
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
down and some companies are not able to

678
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,520
recover

679
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
after an attack

680
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
of course as i mentioned the picture

681
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,679
could be part of an attack that is

682
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,000
designed to try to download a ransomware

683
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,919
and once it runs over attacks if the

684
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,559
company is not ready then

685
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,240
you know the confidentiality of the data

686
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,400
will be lost you know attackers will be

687
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
able to access confidential data they

688
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,279
will try to

689
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,400
you know try

690
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
they will tell the victim okay if you

691
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,919
don't pay this amount of money then

692
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,159
we'll just share the list the full list

693
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
for your customers on this

694
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,679
hacker forum

695
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,279
or this you know dark side forum

696
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,360
and of course they will try to recover

697
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
their investment so they will they will

698
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,279
ask for money for that many companies

699
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,279
that are not ready to manage those type

700
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,440
of situation will start to end paying

701
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
which is not a good idea because

702
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,000
you know it will it will demonstrate the

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,679
attacker that is a good business is a

704
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,000
good area where they can earn a lot of

705
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
money also as you know there are some

706
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
companies there are some insurance

707
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,360
companies that are offering insurance in

708
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,600
case of a ransomware and that once again

709
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
that's a dual layer situation because

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,080
attacker will say okay if the victim

711
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
doesn't pay me then the insurance

712
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
company will pay me so

713
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,200
i it increased the possibility to earn

714
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,039
money for the attacker

715
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,360
economy losses of course you know attack

716
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
customers will not like to have their

717
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,039
money on a bank that has been attacked

718
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,279
that has has a security branch so they

719
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,960
will lose their customers they will lose

720
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,039
their profit they will lose opportunity

721
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,320
for business

722
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,080
and customers of course it will be

723
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,559
impacted their data privacy will be lost

724
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,240
they will not be able to access their

725
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,559
systems and their data could be affected

726
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
now this is a an example of a real

727
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,279
estate attack so this person one used to

728
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,200
work for a technology company

729
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,039
and this company one this person was

730
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,080
stealing um some

731
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,000
important and confidential data about a

732
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
new technology that has that was being

733
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
developed at that time

734
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,080
and he tried to sell those type of

735
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,799
information to china okay so how he did

736
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,120
it he was hiding all the data in very

737
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
nice pictures like sunsets and this type

738
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
of things and he was sending those

739
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,919
pictures to his personal email

740
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,320
using the copyright computer

741
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
so of course he was

742
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
prosecuted however this is an example of

743
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,799
a state war attack where stegorophy was

744
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,679
used for bad

745
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,400
so can you what can you use to steal

746
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
information what can you use to hide

747
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,760
information you can use different type

748
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
of carriers one of them could be

749
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,279
pictures as i was mentioning you can use

750
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,919
video you can use pdf files even word

751
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
excel powerpoint any type of

752
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
file basically

753
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,840
and even audio files like an mp3 a web

754
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,720
file so there are many type of carriers

755
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,039
from the digital perspective

756
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
that could be used to steal information

757
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,919
and to send data to the attackers

758
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,679
how does it work well one of the most

759
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,760
common techniques and very simple

760
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,600
techniques will be the least significant

761
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
bit

762
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,840
as you know

763
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,400
every image is composed of very

764
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,120
small units known as pixels and each

765
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,919
pixel will represent a color code right

766
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,600
that color code will be based on the

767
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,320
combination of three main colors the red

768
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,120
green and blue right every single the

769
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,279
combination of these red green and blue

770
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,080
will

771
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,880
generate you know a new tone of color

772
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
so the idea down here is to try to

773
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,559
perform very small

774
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,840
and very smart you know changes

775
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,039
to the

776
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,000
color coding right that at the end will

777
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,919
enable us to hide

778
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,640
sections of whatever i want to hide in

779
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,679
some specific pixels or group of pixels

780
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,600
that are going to be distributed in the

781
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
in the image

782
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
that a human eye will not be able to

783
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,799
detect for a human eye will just look

784
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
exactly the same picture but at the end

785
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,600
inside those color coding there will be

786
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
some values that are going to be

787
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,480
encoded

788
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,679
in using this technique

789
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,760
for example let's say that i want to

790
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
hide

791
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
this information

792
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
okay

793
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,840
so i want to hide this data the color

794
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,880
coding for this data will be 178 which

795
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
is at the end this type of tone of

796
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,320
yellow all right the original pixel

797
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
without being affected this is the color

798
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
code in this case 117

799
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
which has a little bit brighter you know

800
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,480
ton

801
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
so what attacker will do the attacker

802
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,000
would try to modify some bits

803
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,279
some bits

804
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,240
of the a pixel that will represent a

805
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
color code that is very similar to the

806
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,720
original that a human eye will not be

807
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,039
able to detect for me this is almost the

808
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,080
same

809
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
probably because i'm not wearing my

810
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
glasses but they're almost the same

811
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
and as you can see even the color code

812
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,039
is very 117 123 you know so once again

813
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,200
they make a made a very small change but

814
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
they were able to hide a section of the

815
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,559
code that they want to send

816
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,159
inside a pixel

817
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,559
and the color coding was again very

818
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,799
similar

819
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
now is this too difficult to implement

820
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,440
extremely easy there are many tools that

821
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
are available you know open source tools

822
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
that are available to um users

823
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,080
technology but once again signorf is not

824
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,919
bad it can be used for copyright

825
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,000
protection you can be it can be used to

826
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,240
confirm you know that you download

827
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,600
an mp3 file from the proper artist you

828
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
know or singer

829
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,919
however it can be used for bad so one

830
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,080
example could be this one this this tool

831
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,399
is known as a stack online this tool

832
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,120
doesn't need any admin rights as long as

833
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,039
you're able to access this website then

834
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,640
you will be able to hide information so

835
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
just as an example

836
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,799
if i go down here

837
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,279
and i select any picture let's say that

838
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,120
i want to select i'm going to desktop

839
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
i'm going to hack in paris

840
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,640
i'm going to select this r15

841
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,520
i want to embed some data okay and i

842
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
just modify any

843
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,840
pixels you know and what exactly what

844
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,520
section of the color coding i want to

845
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,039
change you know the red the green or the

846
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,760
blue and then whatever i want to do to

847
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
hide

848
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,639
for example hacking paris

849
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,159
so as you can see the picture looks

850
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,080
exactly the same as the original one and

851
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,440
then i'm just going to download it

852
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
there it goes so this is downloaded

853
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,600
picture

854
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,959
and this is the original

855
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
as you can see for human eye they look

856
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,399
exactly the same

857
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,200
however one of these pictures has the

858
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,320
data that has been um

859
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,399
embedded so how can i extract the data

860
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,320
well it will be a very similar process

861
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
so in this case i'm going to upload the

862
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,559
file in this case which file the one

863
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,440
that i just unload

864
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,559
i need to extract

865
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
i hide the data on these three

866
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,640
in

867
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,240
pixels i'm just going to click on go

868
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,960
and it says this is in human readable

869
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,679
format the information that was sent

870
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,039
hidden

871
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,880
so you can see once again there was no

872
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
need to install anything it was just a

873
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,360
matter of access in this website

874
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,279
you can also do the same thing with um

875
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,039
once again the leaving of the land you

876
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,360
know technique using the copy command

877
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
the copy command is a good command it's

878
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
a command design

879
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,519
to that could help for backups for a

880
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
purposes however it could be used for a

881
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,159
segurography attack so this look at this

882
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,640
so it's very simple you just type

883
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,240
copy slash b

884
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,159
all right the name of the cover file

885
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,720
want what you want to hide and then the

886
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,200
cover file so let's make a quick test

887
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
so for example if i click on down here i

888
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,880
clicked here

889
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,559
i see that there's a

890
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
there are a couple of pictures like r15

891
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,880
the one that i just used there's a text

892
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
file let's say this is a file that i

893
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,640
want to hide so

894
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,000
let's see what it what it has

895
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,399
okay so this text file has a method that

896
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,240
says this is a test that's all that it

897
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,200
has

898
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
so i'm going to try to hide it over here

899
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,919
so copy slash b because i want to modify

900
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,720
the

901
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
a cover file

902
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
in a binary format so the cover file

903
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,279
will be in this case the yamaha

904
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,159
all right

905
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,720
plus what i want to hide the hidden

906
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,760
okay one space and then the name of the

907
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,399
new file for example car that png

908
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
all right so now if i click there now

909
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,919
i'm gonna see a card.png so once again

910
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,559
if i go down here and look for car png

911
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,039
you see the picture it looks exactly the

912
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,399
same nothing weird down here however if

913
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
you open up this file

914
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,799
maybe with a notepad

915
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,799
and if you go

916
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,640
on to the bottom you're gonna see that

917
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,440
says

918
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,720
this is a test in plain text so this is

919
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,039
how you were able to hide information

920
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,159
in this

921
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,200
picture easily

922
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,080
now how can you hide information even in

923
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
a more complicated way so you can use

924
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
three tools pain quality sony visualizer

925
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,120
so it's very simple for example i'm

926
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,158
gonna go first to paint

927
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,320
all right i'm gonna type something down

928
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
here

929
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,360
okay then i'm going to draw a line a

930
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
line

931
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,519
this is just a way to save time because

932
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,880
with the line

933
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,919
when the

934
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,679
system is going to analyze the picture

935
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,200
it's going to know that this is the end

936
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
so after that there's nothing hidden so

937
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,279
i'm just going to click on save as i'm

938
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,919
going to save this as a pnpmp

939
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,399
pmp

940
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,480
let me go to the

941
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,480
desktop

942
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,480
all right so now i have a picture that's

943
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,440
it

944
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
that picture contains the text that i

945
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,519
want to hide now let's see how we can

946
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,200
play around with this so if i go to guay

947
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,519
willa

948
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
i go to the decks of hacking parents

949
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,639
there's a hacking person here

950
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,599
perfect

951
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,119
so the process that i'm going to try to

952
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,119
do right now is to convert this picture

953
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,079
into a sound file so how do i do it very

954
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,320
easily just go to sound and then click

955
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,918
on render without blue if you're using

956
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,760
if you're wearing headsets just take it

957
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,520
out because it's going to make a very

958
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,399
uncomfortable noise

959
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,239
perfect now we have a picture that has

960
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,560
been converted into a sound file so i'm

961
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,119
going to save it as a sound file

962
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,800
and i'm going to go down here once again

963
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,560
to hack in paris i'm going to type

964
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,759
hiking paris music

965
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,520
alright

966
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
so

967
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
if i go to the desktop now to the

968
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
hacking parents now you're going to see

969
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
that there have a audio file

970
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,359
and as you saw on using the previous

971
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,960
previous example

972
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,839
i could even um download an mp3 file

973
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,400
maybe with my favorite roxon and then

974
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,880
i'm gonna i could easily hide this wav

975
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,440
file into the mp3 file and even play the

976
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,440
mp3 cell mp3 file without any issue okay

977
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,599
now how can i extract the data that has

978
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,359
been hidden i could do it with the

979
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,720
following tool

980
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,319
if we go to sonic visualizer

981
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,160
okay

982
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,200
there it is

983
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
then i'm going to have to open up the

984
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,280
file that has been created in this case

985
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,599
the hack in paris music

986
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,280
all right down here there's nothing this

987
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,800
is just an audio file that has been

988
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,560
analyzed so now i'm gonna go to the

989
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
layer

990
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,079
um

991
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,839
inspector

992
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,640
and then all channels

993
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
okay once again i don't see nothing

994
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,359
important here to make it easier to read

995
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,680
you can change it for black and white

996
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,799
and then just zoom in

997
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,720
and as you can see down here it says

998
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,560
i can see in plain text the information

999
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,279
that has been here

1000
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,119
okay

1001
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,720
now once again we can combine techniques

1002
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,599
we can combine external frame

1003
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,000
malware and fileless malware to perform

1004
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,040
this attack okay let's see an example

1005
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,359
let's say that someone prepare a payload

1006
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,280
that payload has been sent to the victim

1007
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
the victim

1008
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
unfortunately double clicks on the

1009
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,640
attach file and when they attack they

1010
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
will click on the text file it's gonna

1011
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
create a reverse shell connection so now

1012
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,280
the attacker has access to the shell of

1013
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,359
the computer of the of the computer

1014
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,400
victim

1015
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,880
okay so when he has access to the shell

1016
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
of the

1017
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
victim he's gonna type powershell and

1018
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,599
then he will be able to execute

1019
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,839
powershell commands once again without

1020
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,680
installing nothing down from this point

1021
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
and on we are going to try to cause

1022
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,000
damage without installing any

1023
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,079
application or download

1024
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,079
for example let's say that this attacker

1025
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
is going to go to the document section

1026
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,480
and he found a couple of files that cut

1027
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,400
their attention like like they're

1028
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
precious like the way this guy said in

1029
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,119
the

1030
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,720
lord of the ring movie

1031
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
so uh let's for example let's imagine

1032
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,960
that this customer.txt contains you know

1033
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
pi information about customers this

1034
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,200
server that txt contains technical data

1035
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,040
about you know ip addresses operating

1036
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,119
system what this

1037
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,040
what is the function of that web server

1038
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,880
of that server

1039
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,320
so we want to try to see all that

1040
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
information how can we steal the data

1041
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,240
easily without installing nothing we

1042
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
could use

1043
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,200
in this case the compressor archive this

1044
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,040
is going to create a c file

1045
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,119
where we are going to hide whatever is

1046
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,839
in the in this case in the document

1047
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,079
folder so whatever is in the document

1048
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,160
folder is going to be

1049
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,640
compressed and embedded in a zip file in

1050
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,079
this case the gold.zip file

1051
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,119
then

1052
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,119
to start generating some need for the

1053
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,599
customer to on the victim to pay if we

1054
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,240
want to ask for money we could delete

1055
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
the files from his computer

1056
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,280
so using once again an existing command

1057
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,320
remove that i dash item it's gonna in

1058
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,520
this case i'm gonna say delete

1059
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,880
everything that is in the document

1060
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,160
folder

1061
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,599
and this is interesting because when

1062
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
they when you execute this command those

1063
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
files will not go to the recycle bin

1064
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,520
they will be deleted you know there's

1065
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,200
it's not this recycle bin will be empty

1066
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
so if you have a backup or you don't

1067
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,119
have you don't know how to do some

1068
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,040
forensics to record files then you will

1069
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,720
be in trouble

1070
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
now let's try to apply stagnation this

1071
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,560
attack so in this case i'm going to go

1072
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,400
to the downloads folder and with the

1073
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
fsutil

1074
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,160
command which again is an existing

1075
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,640
binary that is already on the computer

1076
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,119
i'm going to create on the fly a picture

1077
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,040
that is big enough in this case a cover

1078
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,560
file that is speaking of

1079
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,119
where i can hide the c file in this case

1080
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,640
the zip file is very small because it's

1081
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,960
just an example 1k

1082
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,920
am so i'm going to create this 58

1083
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
kilobytes um

1084
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,520
file

1085
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,119
to hide the gold.zip that's it so i get

1086
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,800
with this command i was able to create

1087
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,960
this this picture of course this picture

1088
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,680
is not it's gonna contain some random

1089
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,720
values

1090
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,960
so it's not gonna it's gonna it's not

1091
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,800
gonna look like a real picture but at

1092
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
least for the operating system it is a

1093
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
picture

1094
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,800
so using the copy command that i showed

1095
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,760
you previously i'm able to hide the zip

1096
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,560
file

1097
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,520
inside the cover file and create a stego

1098
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,400
file in this case the

1099
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,839
player.pnp that's the file that contains

1100
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,079
the zip file that you know that the c

1101
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,400
file contains in two files that we were

1102
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
able to steal

1103
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
and once again we can use the remove

1104
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,400
item goal and remove item in the remove

1105
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,640
item to delete i'm sorry dc file and

1106
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
also to delete the color file

1107
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,880
now interesting so you may say okay i'm

1108
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,839
able at this point to steal data yes i'm

1109
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,599
able to

1110
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,920
generate the need because we delete the

1111
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
original files we have

1112
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,920
we know where the file is hidden but how

1113
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,839
can i obtain the copy of the file as an

1114
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,480
attacker right well easily interesting

1115
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,119
would be that we could use a

1116
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,280
you know a solution that is designed to

1117
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,000
protect us in this case windows defender

1118
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,040
to upload the file that contains the

1119
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,960
value in this case the c folder contains

1120
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,920
the

1121
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
valuable data

1122
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,520
whatever we want so i'm not saying the

1123
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,280
windows defender is bad windows offender

1124
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,760
is a very good solution however this is

1125
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,079
an example of how you can use good tools

1126
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,880
for path

1127
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,400
and of course we want to delete our

1128
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,520
tracks so we can use a powershell to get

1129
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,920
an event lock and in this case i'm going

1130
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,839
to go lazy i'm just going to say delete

1131
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,760
everything all the logs from the event

1132
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,839
log of course you can do even better you

1133
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,920
can just say delete these specific

1134
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,839
entries from the event log to delete

1135
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,319
your tracks

1136
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,640
and once i execute it you see that

1137
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,599
before i did it there was almost 8 000

1138
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,839
you know events and then there was only

1139
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,599
one and the only one that is under is

1140
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,359
where i clear the other locks

1141
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,240
and

1142
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,319
your imagination will be the limit you

1143
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,599
know you can start you know run

1144
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,560
somewhere

1145
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,280
a similar attack or take a strategy you

1146
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,440
can leave a note on there and continue

1147
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,200
playing around

1148
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,520
now how can you protect so the first the

1149
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,000
number one will be through good and very

1150
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,960
con

1151
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,720
through very good and also through

1152
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,240
continuous training

1153
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,319
you need to learn what type of social

1154
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,000
engineering the mix exists you need to

1155
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,560
make sure that everybody on your company

1156
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
know what is social engineering they

1157
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,160
know how to detect you know a fish

1158
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
enable they know how to detect a

1159
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,000
as mission they know how to detect you

1160
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
know a fake call like fishing because

1161
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,760
there are many ways to try to fool

1162
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,000
people because that's the weakest

1163
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,359
um

1164
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,960
yeah the weakest link you know in the

1165
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,920
chain

1166
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,760
and and and you know the chain would be

1167
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
as strong as a weakest link so that's

1168
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,760
why you need to make sure everybody has

1169
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,920
the proper training endpoint security

1170
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
yes you need to have a way to detect on

1171
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,079
each and every one of the devices if

1172
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,599
something is not working properly if

1173
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,599
there's any malware that is trying to be

1174
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,520
executed or any commands malicious

1175
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,760
command that is being executed

1176
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,599
to try to protect against information

1177
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,440
leakage make sure they have a data

1178
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,119
leakage protection system that is going

1179
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,440
to analyze the data that the outgoing

1180
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,760
data to avoid that type of data to

1181
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,079
reach you know the

1182
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,000
the destination you know from this case

1183
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,079
the destination of the attacker

1184
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,000
network security

1185
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,920
this is important not only from the

1186
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,680
perimeter perspective but also from the

1187
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,520
zero trust perspective make sure that

1188
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,359
you analyze that you have proper

1189
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,720
authentication to have proper

1190
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
identification they have a way to

1191
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,319
protect each and every one of your

1192
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
network devices uh that they have the

1193
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,680
proper

1194
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
updates you know firmware

1195
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,000
uh and so on so this is a multi-layer as

1196
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,839
you can see solution we have to make

1197
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,119
like like a

1198
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,280
as you can see like an audience here as

1199
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,359
many layers as possible so the attacker

1200
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,880
will not feel comfortable they will

1201
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,560
start losing time they will still lose

1202
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,400
money because at the end they also have

1203
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,720
to invest to attack so they have to

1204
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,880
recover their investment so that's the

1205
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,680
harder and the most complicated we do it

1206
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
will be better for us

1207
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,599
and it's not going to be a very good a

1208
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,000
business for them for the attackers

1209
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,839
make sure they have a proper monitoring

1210
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,599
you know you have a scene to be able to

1211
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,599
detect in real time what is going on

1212
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,520
that you have the proper team

1213
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,359
and trained team you know to identify if

1214
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,960
it is a false positive is a false

1215
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,480
negative and they have the proper

1216
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,640
incident management plan

1217
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,720
uh i implement this privilege in other

1218
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
words only assign

1219
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,440
in the privileges that are required to

1220
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,839
people to perform their job no more not

1221
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,599
less only what is strictly required okay

1222
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,640
so why would you enable for example

1223
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
a secretary to be able to

1224
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
access the panel and control

1225
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,599
why

1226
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,359
is it there any technical reason if

1227
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,920
there's no business need then don't

1228
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,319
assign those type of rights to people

1229
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,200
because

1230
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,640
it doesn't impact in any way on their on

1231
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,920
their ability to perform their job

1232
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,520
in monitor what commands are being

1233
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,880
executed i'm going to show you shortly

1234
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
you know a couple of options so when i

1235
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
was saying e

1236
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,240
to make sure that you have a proper

1237
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,920
endpoint protection is for example make

1238
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,839
sure you have an antivirus that have an

1239
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,720
edr system that you have for example a

1240
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,640
host-based intrusion detection system to

1241
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,400
detect some possible situations that are

1242
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,040
being that are occurring implement a dlp

1243
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,440
as i was mentioning your email and even

1244
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,520
instant messaging solution

1245
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,160
and because this type of you know as i

1246
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,440
was mentioning there are some malware

1247
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,800
that are that is able to change

1248
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,440
polymorphic malware make sure you have

1249
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,119
implemented

1250
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,040
behavioral analytics solutions and also

1251
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,560
machine learning so they they kind of

1252
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,119
start analyzing data based on patterns

1253
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,720
and detect new behaviors that are not

1254
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,520
that could be a a malicious situation

1255
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,040
monitor for example changes on the

1256
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,359
services a new service that has been

1257
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,599
that is a start you know and for why

1258
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,240
that a service went down who shut down

1259
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,599
that service

1260
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,480
uh changes on the windows registry why

1261
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,319
change is being performed the windows

1262
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,160
registry are you installing something

1263
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,400
what is been installed right and monitor

1264
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,599
applications

1265
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,760
in the edr there are edrs that are able

1266
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,440
to detect the use of for example of

1267
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
malicious commands using powershell as

1268
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
you can see down here so make sure that

1269
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,480
you have proper edrs to detect the usage

1270
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,760
of in

1271
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,599
loadings even if the lance you know

1272
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,040
binaries and the scripts that could be

1273
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
used for ban

1274
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,800
minimalism and control this is extremely

1275
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,960
important so once again i'm not saying

1276
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,680
that

1277
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,720
um

1278
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,599
that a powershell is bad or a

1279
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,400
windows management system is bad

1280
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,359
no just make sure that you monitor and

1281
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,440
that you enable only what is strictly

1282
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,880
required make sure that you have a

1283
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,640
proper separation of duties that is

1284
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
extremely important the person that is

1285
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,359
able that is

1286
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,359
that is going to be implemented a change

1287
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,640
as an example

1288
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,119
that person cannot be the same person is

1289
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,960
going to approve that change you have to

1290
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,040
have different

1291
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,359
duties assigned to different people to

1292
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,960
make sure that you have a proper you

1293
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,160
know separation to do this once again

1294
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
install only require management tools

1295
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
there are many management tools for

1296
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
windows for linux

1297
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,680
for android whatever but just make sure

1298
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
to only install whatever it is require

1299
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,440
if you don't need them anymore and

1300
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,160
install those management tools monitor

1301
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
their usage and make sure that you

1302
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,839
monitor those accounts that has more

1303
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,760
privilege in this case the privilege

1304
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,440
access management using a pam solution

1305
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,400
from the

1306
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,079
tracking perspective

1307
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,400
you know that powershell commands can be

1308
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,880
tracked and so you can you can enable

1309
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,720
the tracking of the user powershell

1310
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,440
commands using the group policy editor

1311
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,040
and of course make sure that you have a

1312
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,160
way to aggregate logs and to analyze the

1313
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,359
logs and you have

1314
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,760
a proper use cases proper alerts that

1315
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,839
you are continually fine-tuning you know

1316
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,680
the alerts to make sure that you are as

1317
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,800
effective as possible

1318
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,640
finally make sure that your equipments

1319
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,480
are up to date you know have a

1320
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,640
proper patch management a solution

1321
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,880
implemented and make sure that your

1322
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,400
system are up to date not only on

1323
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,440
drivers but also in firmware but also on

1324
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,000
updates you know hot fixes

1325
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,400
whatever is required and and extremely

1326
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,520
important

1327
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,160
have an inventory know exactly what you

1328
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,559
have because if if not you know you will

1329
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,559
not be able to protect them you need to

1330
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,599
know what software a do you have license

1331
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
you know what applications are being

1332
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,200
used

1333
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,280
what computers do you have right what

1334
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,680
operating system and so on make sure you

1335
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,760
have a good inventory even virtual

1336
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,440
machines you need to avoid you know

1337
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,680
virtual machine or vms pro you know
