1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,359
hello

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
how's it going everyone i am jake

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,240
it is great to be here

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
virtually at hack in paris this is uh

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
going to be my talk on incident response

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,359
and that's coming from my background

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,400
in emergency healthcare

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,160
cool so yeah i'm jake bynum i am a

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
software engineer i live in the san

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
francisco bay area

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
i work currently at a seattle-based

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
startup called commodore

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
before common room i worked at slack for

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,320
a little over four years on the

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
enterprise product

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
primarily my background is mainly in

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,399
application engineering specifically in

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
the back end but i've dabbled across the

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
stack

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,640
um so

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,480
outside of my work as a software

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
software engineer i've actually worked

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,160
as an emergency medical technician for

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
the better part of around seven years

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
and during that time i've worked in

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,119
9-1-1 response as well as

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,439
non-transporting first response as well

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,520
as standby medicine in areas like

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
concerts and events

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,880
during that time i've also responded to

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,600
various calls they range from

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,720
small cuts and bruises to severe cardiac

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
traumatic and medical emergencies

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,200
so why am i here uh well i am talking

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
about software instant response um and

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
how it ties into my experience with

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
emergency medical response uh my

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
background is not particularly uh

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,680
security related um but these tools that

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
i'm gonna be talking about here

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
should uh generally be fairly reusable

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479
in most software contexts

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,000
um somebody this uh this talk is

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,399
actually not super technical in nature

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,119
um it's fairly general and it's rather

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,680
uh geared towards folks who are curious

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
about emergency response and software

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
incidents and how they might overlap

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,799
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
what incidents are and how they can be a

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,159
helpful tool

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
i'm also going to talk a little bit

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,199
about emergency

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,200
medical response and how that works um

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
i'm also going to be talking about

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
things like stress management um

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
blamelessness uh and then i'll also talk

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
about some tips that i've learned just

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,720
from my uh my experience and um

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
yeah then i'll wrap things up

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
um so before we get started uh i do want

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,200
to just give fair warning that um some

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
of this talk does have some anecdotes

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,640
and references to

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
some fairly morbid

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
content from my time as an emt uh just

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
in case anyone is triggered by this i do

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
want to give ample warning about that

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,640
cool so let's dive in

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
uh cool so before defining how a

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
software incentive uh software incident

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
works i would like to talk briefly about

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,440
how uh this kind of works in the

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
emergency medical world uh with these

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,599
things called mass casualty incidents

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,400
so

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
in ems and firefighting we have this

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
concept of mass casualty incident which

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
more commonly called an mci

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
and that entails an emergency where

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
there are more patients than providers

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
that can treat them

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
so an example here is a building

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
collapse uh bus crash

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
some uh

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
events similar to those when um a single

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,599
first responder uh has one patient to

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
deal with that's okay that's manageable

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
that's

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
the usual scenario um however in a

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
single uh incident there may be two

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
three uh or ten patients for every

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
single responder um and when that

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,640
happens you as a responder need to

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,680
decide who gets treatment uh and when

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
so uh an mci is a situation in which you

97
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
uh need to triage those individuals and

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,280
manage your logistics and resources

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
carefully and deliberately

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
um so an important part of the mci

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,000
process is triage um so before treating

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
anyone you need to gain an assessment of

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
what's going on to do this uh the triage

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,879
teams are going to search the scene for

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,159
any patients

106
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,599
and they'll get a very quick overview of

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
the state of that patient and based on

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
that they'll assign a color based on how

109
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
severe they are um this should take no

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,960
more than 15-20 seconds of patient

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
in california we use a triage system

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
called start triage it's pretty common

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
um the order in that

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,199
triage system is green yellow red and

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,320
black

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
someone with a green tag is in pretty

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
good shape

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
they may have some cuts and bruises but

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
generally are able to walk and seek

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
medical treatment we usually call those

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,479
walking wounded

122
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,320
yellow indicates that they are unable to

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
move uh to seek medical treatment but

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
are other ways okay um these patients

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
for example might have like a broken leg

126
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
they are stationary

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,639
but otherwise they're doing all right

128
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
um so then we're getting into red and

129
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
these are patients that are requiring

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,880
immediate treatment uh these are the

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
highest priority uh and generally these

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
are the ones that you're going to have

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
the highest likelihood of developing

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,919
and finally there are black tags uh

135
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
which are the ones that you do not think

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
you're going to survive uh and generally

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
are going to be de-prioritized in favor

138
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,240
of the red tanks

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
sorry um i that was a bit of a morbid

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
note to start up i promise it is

141
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
relevant

142
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,039
um so the goal in these emergencies uh

143
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
is to determine everything that's wrong

144
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,199
and prioritize getting uh it as close to

145
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,800
uh you know fixed and getting our

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,440
patients better as fast as possible

147
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,039
that being said not everything needs to

148
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,360
be addressed at once so

149
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
you

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
as an emt as a firefighter need to

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
effectively manage your time and

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
resources

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,520
an incident in the software world uh is

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
a tool used to manage these equivalent

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,319
software emergencies obviously there's

156
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,639
decoupled but uh for the metaphor's

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,199
purpose um some examples of incidents

158
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,160
are

159
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
some users are unable to log into our

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
servers uh

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
a database shard is completely down um

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,960
maybe a malicious actor might have

163
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
gotten access to some sensitive

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,440
information

165
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,880
um i stumbled on this uh definition that

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,759
servicenow put out which i really liked

167
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,440
an incident is an occurrence that can

168
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
disrupt or cause a loss of operations

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,319
services or functions instant incident

170
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
management describes the necessary

171
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
actions taken by an organization to

172
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,479
analyze identify and correct problems

173
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
while taking actions that can prevent

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,960
future incidents

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
there are a lot of pieces of enterprise

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,479
software that are dedicated specifically

177
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,599
for solving incidents i don't personally

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280
have any affiliation with them but some

179
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,479
of these include

180
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
pager duty servicenow ox genie

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
solarwinds fresh service

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,319
for the purpose of this talk i'm just

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
going to talk about the bare bones core

184
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
concepts of responding to an incident uh

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
outside of any

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,919
indep independently of any um existing

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,799
software solutions

188
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
um so in medical emergencies we have

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
various roles to

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,840
resolve things like mcis and other

191
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
medical incidents some of these roles

192
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
are the incident commander

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,880
that is the actual term used in mcis and

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,520
their goal their job is that they are in

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
charge of managing the flow and

196
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
prioritization of the overall

197
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,479
um under that we have uh teams like

198
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,400
triage teams which are prioritizing

199
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
patients using start triage uh you have

200
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,800
rescue teams that might be going into

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
buildings and extricating patients

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,639
uh you can have a logistics team

203
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
managing what equipment you have

204
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
an operations team managing things like

205
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,120
radio communications and several other

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
teams that are involved in that incident

207
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
um in software incidents you

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,800
might have several types of goals as

209
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
well including incident commander

210
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120
subject matter experts um a liaisons for

211
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
any customers affected

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
someone describing details of outages

213
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
and other

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
roles that you think might be necessary

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
um the subject matter experts in our

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,720
world are often engineers who are

217
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
working to write and run scripts for

218
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
example or patch code

219
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,758
in order to resolve an issue

220
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,160
um the the architecture of these

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,759
both medical and software incidents are

222
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
actually pretty uh similar so here's

223
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,279
what uh a 911 call uh would look like

224
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
the the flow here is that um someone

225
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
would witness an emergency and then they

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,399
decide to call 9-1-1 or

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,519
depending on which country you are it

228
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
might be 999 etc

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
the 911 dispatchers will listen to the

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
nature of the emergency um and decide

231
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
which resources to send uh depending on

232
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
the nature of it that could be fire

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
medical police

234
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
and when the actual responding units get

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
to the patient uh the

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
responding uh units can also request

237
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
additional resources as they learn more

238
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,959
information

239
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
uh we can model the incident response

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,399
similarly where we have

241
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,240
a workflow where someone might notice an

242
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,959
influx of new customer tickets

243
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,839
or

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,440
to have this non

245
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
not reliant on a human you can have an

246
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
automated alert that might automatically

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
page an engineer when an alert threshold

248
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,600
gets too high uh at your company you

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
might have some incident response uh

250
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
process where that could be activated

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,120
and then the incident commander whoever

252
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,279
might be on call they would decide which

253
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,920
teams to page based on the major so if

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
the report is pertinent to um security

255
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
you might be able to page application

256
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
security team

257
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
uh cloud engineering team billing team

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,839
or

259
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,680
whichever team is uh

260
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,599
pertinent for this particular issue

261
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
so uh let's talk about what incents are

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
good for

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
they can be

264
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,000
super helpful for managing a streamlined

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,399
response for an emergency um so

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,600
generally

267
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,399
uh it entails creating this environment

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,720
in which responders can dedicate time uh

269
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
and resources to resolve an issue

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
uh for example you might have a slack or

271
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
discord channel uh dedicated to

272
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
resolving an issue uh in which the

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,440
subject matter experts the ins uh

274
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,279
commanders and everyone else can discuss

275
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,440
uh a strategy for getting back to green

276
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
get getting back to a good state

277
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,120
um

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
similarly uh incidents even outside of

279
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,200
the incident itself they can be a good

280
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
archive so they can be used to prevent

281
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,600
future incidents by writing a history

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,800
and of what happened and why

283
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,560
uh that being said incidents are not the

284
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
right tool for everything um

285
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,399
i've seen it be used just to escalate a

286
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,760
frustrating bug

287
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
uh which is in my opinion not the right

288
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,480
use for that streamlined response um

289
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,519
another misconception during these uh

290
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,480
software

291
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
uh incidents these software emergencies

292
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
is that you need to solve everything to

293
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,640
be back to 100 perfect

294
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
when in reality uh

295
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
my philosophy is that the goal should be

296
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
to get back to a stable state uh where

297
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
having everyone uh talking about an

298
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
issue everyone uh swarming an issue

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,399
might not be uh needed

300
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,040
for example if you had a thousand users

301
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
that were deactivated and a handful of

302
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
those users needed some extra

303
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,040
extra scripts extra tlc to

304
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
be completely restored

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
maybe you don't need everyone swarming

306
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
on this issue maybe you can downgrade

307
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
and deal with those as uh

308
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
in a normal bug fashion

309
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,839
um

310
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,279
incidents have various severities

311
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,839
generally um you you uh you might hear

312
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
them also referred to as sevs sometimes

313
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519
um that's that's what this is referring

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
to you can define your own severity

315
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
levels at your company but generally

316
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
they fall into around four categories

317
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
where you have step one or sub-zero and

318
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
that could be an outage level event

319
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,839
where all or most users are for whatever

320
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,399
reason unable to access your service

321
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
it could also not be a user facing issue

322
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
it might be a high

323
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,519
priority

324
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,399
workflow a high priority security issue

325
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,240
or something some tooling that's broken

326
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
internally that's preventing everyone

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,399
from doing their job on the other side

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
of the spectrum um you have things like

329
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
severity four incidents and those are

330
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,880
probably less serious where maybe only a

331
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,720
handful of users are experiencing an

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,279
issue um but again you can calibrate

333
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,959
these severities based on your own

334
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,839
definitions

335
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,399
in

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,800
the incident management in emergency

337
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
services we have this concept of canned

338
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
reports those are typically in

339
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
california fire where you are regularly

340
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
reporting the conditions of the

341
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
situation the actions that are being

342
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
taken and any needs that you might have

343
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
you can use a similar tool in software

344
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,560
incident response where you might use

345
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
these reports every 15 minutes or so the

346
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
idea here being to let everyone know

347
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,399
what the state of uh the world is

348
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,240
say hey we're working on it this is

349
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
who's doing what um and this is what we

350
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
need to do

351
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,519
these updates are really just meant to

352
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
provide an immediate understanding of

353
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
the current situation so

354
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,320
uh what is where we are and where we

355
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
need to be

356
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,880
um at the very end uh after the incident

357
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
is cleared and everything is back to

358
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
good uh it's helpful to have a debrief

359
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
often referred to as a postmortem um so

360
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,680
the idea here is to ask what went wrong

361
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,120
uh what how did we as a team respond how

362
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,199
could we have responded better

363
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
and an important question is how could

364
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,560
this have been avoided in the first

365
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
place

366
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
this is a good stage to assign any

367
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
action items such as

368
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,399
monitoring

369
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,839
alerting for things that customers

370
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,800
reported etc

371
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,000
so um one question that's often asked is

372
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,880
uh when is something an incident versus

373
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
just a bug um and generally there's

374
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,279
no clear answer um it depends on what

375
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,639
your company's definitions and

376
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
parameters are of what's acceptable

377
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,279
behavior um a general heuristic that i

378
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
would personally ask is um

379
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,120
if someone reports something

380
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,639
if you're dealing with it around the end

381
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,000
of the day

382
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
could you safely walk away and have it

383
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
be acceptable from your customer's point

384
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
of view

385
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
so let's go over an example

386
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,880
um so

387
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,040
hypothetical example you have a scenario

388
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
where a disgruntled employee

389
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,000
decided to delete uh 10 000 users in

390
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,639
your service

391
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
several users have written in that they

392
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
can't log in

393
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,160
uh the customer team that's managing all

394
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
the tickets they see an influx of new

395
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,839
tickets and they decide to declare a

396
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
declare an incident

397
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
uh the incident commander who's on call

398
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
they joined the incident and um based on

399
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,279
the reports and based on the company's

400
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,360
protocol they decide to classify this as

401
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,720
a severity to incident

402
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
the uh incident commander then decides

403
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
to page in the security and

404
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,040
infrastructure teams

405
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
is a defender uh delegates to security

406
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,160
to disable the user's token

407
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
and the infrastructure team to spin up a

408
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,719
database backup

409
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,959
meanwhile the customer engagement team

410
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
uh they decide to update the website

411
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
and the twitter account letting users

412
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,639
know that there is an ongoing issue

413
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,560
every 15 minutes the incident commander

414
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,079
decides to provide an update of the

415
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,000
state of the incident of how things are

416
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
going and where we need to be

417
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,639
once the malicious users token is

418
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,399
disabled and the users are then

419
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,560
reprovisioned the instant commander asks

420
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,920
the customer team to check in with the

421
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
affected users to confirm that their

422
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,399
accounts are fixed

423
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,519
after uh the customer is confirmed that

424
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,199
the issue is resolved the incident

425
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,680
commander then cleared the incident

426
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,680
and unstaged the responders

427
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
the next day responders i decide to meet

428
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,759
and talk about the incident have a

429
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,920
postmortem and talk about how it could

430
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,120
have been avoided in the first place

431
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
cool that's generally how an incident

432
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,040
works

433
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
um so

434
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
one natural part of incidence is stress

435
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,959
so let's talk about stress management

436
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,680
um so i've seen incidents that can last

437
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
hours or even days depending on the

438
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,800
severity so during this time you as a

439
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,959
responder you might feel stressed

440
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
users aren't able to log in there might

441
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,920
be

442
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,160
executives on the call

443
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
everyone

444
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
the users you

445
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,240
the entire company they want it to be

446
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,520
resolved um that could be a lot of

447
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,039
pressure

448
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,280
uh reducing that stress is definitely

449
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,760
important um but it's also

450
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
in my opinion important to remember that

451
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,839
these types of issues these types of

452
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
emergencies they are natural as part of

453
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
any software company

454
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
and are there just natural as part of

455
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
any growing organization

456
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,799
um that being said i

457
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
definitely think

458
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
check in with yourself and uh making

459
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,919
prioritizing your mental well-being is

460
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,679
extremely important here so

461
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,039
have you been working at this issue for

462
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,120
hours uh do you maybe need something to

463
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
eat or maybe you just need to go on a

464
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
walk and clear your head

465
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,520
i would strongly suggest asking your

466
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
instant commander for some time uh

467
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
you're not going to be productive by

468
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
burning yourself out you're not going to

469
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
be a good responder that way

470
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,120
it's not going to be

471
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,639
helpful for getting back to

472
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,240
green cool um story time

473
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,520
so uh when i was first becoming an emt

474
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
about seven or eight years ago um i was

475
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
extremely nervous for my first shift on

476
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,120
an ambulance

477
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,160
my first 911 call was an 84 year old

478
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
male who was having difficulty breathing

479
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
um so we responded red lights and sirens

480
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
uh also called code three

481
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
and uh

482
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
that's uh

483
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,520
indicating that it was a severe

484
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
emergency where we needed to

485
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
prioritize the response

486
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
so uh we get on scene

487
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,080
and we

488
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
take a look at the patient and i was

489
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,440
immediately terrified

490
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
this is my first emergency the patient

491
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,840
who's having the difficulty breathing

492
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,640
they

493
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
took a look at me and they saw my

494
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
terrified look and they managed to ask

495
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
me are you okay you look like you're

496
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,400
about to faint

497
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,919
that's not

498
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
the goal for uh emt they should

499
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
generally not the patient should

500
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
generally not be asking you if you're

501
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,240
okay

502
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
uh let's talk a little bit about

503
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,639
blameless blamelessness

504
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,320
um so what is blamelessness uh you may

505
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
have heard the term come up a couple

506
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,480
times

507
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,960
the idea here is that um an incident or

508
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,440
some failure event

509
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
there is no single person who should be

510
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
at fault

511
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,080
um blamelessness i think is something

512
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
that is ingrained into culture into your

513
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,679
postmortems

514
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
if engineers are being solely blamed for

515
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
issues

516
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
they are going to shift code more slowly

517
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
during being blamed for anything that

518
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
could go wrong

519
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
instead my suggestion would be to ask

520
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,600
why didn't unit test catch this issue

521
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
were there any automated tests that

522
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,120
could have done this uh any linters

523
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,720
could this have been caught in a pull

524
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,600
request review did any alerts or pages

525
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
go off

526
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
um in the same vein one thing i see

527
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,799
engineers doing in incidents is

528
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,120
apologizing uh they're saying sorry for

529
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,039
making these uh changes

530
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
i would uh

531
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
personally suggest to stop apologizing

532
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,360
uh instead focus on strengthening the

533
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
system and moving forward

534
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,640
apologizing

535
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,000
actually goes against the idea of

536
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
blamelessness because self-blame is

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,120
indeed a form of blame

538
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,240
uh and i can talk a little about some

539
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
tips

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
so um one tool we use in the ems world

541
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
is to stage fake emergencies for folks

542
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,520
who are training you might have heard

543
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
the phrase practice how you play

544
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
well we use that same philosophy for

545
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
training for emergencies

546
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
um so

547
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
i as the

548
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
fake emergency proctor i would call the

549
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
responding unit and give them a prompt i

550
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,520
would say for example ems one please

551
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
respond to 21 john street for a 34 year

552
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,039
old male reported unresponsive

553
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,360
this is the classic example of a 911

554
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,559
dispatch

555
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,320
the responding unit

556
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
would respond and they would have a

557
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,159
patient who is just a stage actor in

558
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,360
this case

559
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,200
the emt who is training would go through

560
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
the full call as usual

561
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
and they would say for example the

562
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
patient has a blood pressure of 120

563
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,960
systolic over 70 diastolic

564
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,640
the proctor of this call would then

565
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
correct the emt and say

566
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,840
for this call your patient's blood

567
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,720
pressure is actually 90 over 60.

568
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
uh these types of

569
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,600
mock emergencies have proven to be

570
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,559
extremely successful in training emts to

571
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,120
prepare for the real stress of

572
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,000
medical emergencies

573
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
one thing that we try to do is uh

574
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
something similar with software

575
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,760
incidents

576
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
you would prepare a possible user

577
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
scenario for example

578
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,159
users are reporting that they're unable

579
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,000
to log into our service uh and are

580
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
reporting slowness across the

581
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,960
application

582
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
uh so depending on how your company does

583
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
instant response uh you could create a

584
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,360
dedicated chat with the responding

585
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,919
people and go through the scenario a

586
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,159
responder might say okay i'm going to

587
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,559
look at the logs

588
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,440
and you as the proctor might say

589
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,679
okay the logs are showing that there are

590
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,960
timeout errors uh when they're

591
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,159
the services reaching out to the

592
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,600
database

593
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
uh so after that the responders would go

594
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,600
through the incident as if it were real

595
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
um the idea here being to simulate the

596
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,159
real thing and you can uh get pretty

597
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,320
creative here i've seen a lot of really

598
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,640
creative mock incidence

599
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
and at the end of it you uh would have a

600
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,880
similar you know post-mortem

601
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
experience where you'd end up writing

602
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,400
new scripts um adding new alerts or

603
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
anything that you might have learned

604
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,000
while going through the

605
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,960
exercise there are a couple use cases

606
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
for mock software incidences um the main

607
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,360
one i've seen is for onboarding

608
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
engineers to uh for example an on-call

609
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,320
system uh or just to get them

610
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,919
used to being responsible for

611
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,880
maintaining the team's features um

612
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
another use case is just trying to think

613
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,640
of the worst case scenario for a new

614
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,799
feature that you're shipping um

615
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
just as

616
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
an exercise to get used to

617
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,960
that kind of stress but also to say okay

618
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
what's the worst case that could happen

619
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
with this feature

620
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
and even if you don't have a practical

621
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,320
reason uh these things are a lot of fun

622
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,679
and they're good practice even if you're

623
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,600
a veteran and you're uh just looking to

624
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,240
exercise that muscle

625
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,679
um another tip

626
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,000
in uh startups it can be definitely

627
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
tricky to clearly define

628
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
which team owns what

629
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,120
uh as companies get bigger knowing which

630
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
team uh to bring in for an issue with a

631
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
certain feature i believe is essential

632
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
um

633
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
accidentally paging the wrong team at

634
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,600
2am for an incident that they don't have

635
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
context on can be awkward i am

636
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,360
definitely speaking from personal

637
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
experience

638
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,279
um during an incident there

639
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
might be several things that are going

640
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
wrong at the same time uh there could be

641
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,440
uh

642
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
ten different uh issues all stemming

643
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
from the same one

644
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
and in that case there may need to be

645
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
several work streams needed to resolve

646
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,440
that incident

647
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
for example if a database shown fell

648
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
over one work stream might need to spin

649
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,279
up a backup database chart uh another

650
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,679
might need to flush the cache and a

651
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,120
third team might need to manage the

652
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,679
customer communication

653
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,159
having dedicated individual work streams

654
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,799
focusing on one issue at a time

655
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,400
in my experience has been extremely

656
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
helpful for getting a clear path

657
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,120
to getting it resolved

658
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
so um one tip is to change the severity

659
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,559
of an incident as you're going through

660
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,159
it um so if you're going through an

661
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,400
incident where it was reported that only

662
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,159
a couple users were having issues maybe

663
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,400
you got two or three tickets um but

664
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
after you dig in a little bit you look

665
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,480
through the logs and you see oh actually

666
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,440
uh 40 50 of users are actually

667
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,760
experiencing this issue um maybe

668
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
consider upgrading their response

669
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
and getting more resources in making

670
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,880
sure that you actually have the people

671
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
you need there to get it resolved

672
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,120
on the

673
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
other side of the spectrum if you think

674
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
uh something seems terribly wrong but

675
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
you actually find that it's more of an

676
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,159
edge case

677
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,840
consider downgrading and allow some

678
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,880
people to

679
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,919
uh maybe on stage uh and if it's late in

680
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,320
the day it may be allowed uh then to

681
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
pick it up in the morning

682
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
i have another uh medical story

683
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,520
um so i was an emt in college uh in

684
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
upstate new york and i was working on a

685
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,159
saturday night on a university campus um

686
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,960
so typically saturday night when you

687
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
have emergencies that's often going to

688
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
be something like intoxication um so

689
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
when we get a call for a

690
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,799
college aged male altered um our initial

691
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,240
thought was that this was going to be an

692
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
intoxication call

693
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,520
um so we got that call and once we

694
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
arrived on scene one night

695
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,679
the patient was not alert and was

696
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
sluggish and responses so far that's not

697
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
a typical for an intoxication call

698
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,720
however

699
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,120
i took the patient's blood pressure

700
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
and i found an anomaly where the reading

701
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,600
was 190 over 110 um for some context uh

702
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
adult male blood pressure should be

703
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,080
around

704
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
10 over 70. um so the patient was

705
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,200
altered but only

706
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,039
seemed to remember the past 30 seconds

707
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,559
at a time

708
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,120
so we did a little bit more uh

709
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
digging into the situation and a

710
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
bystander reported that the patient uh

711
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,559
fell and hit their head against the

712
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,960
concrete um so we no longer expect uh

713
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,039
suspected that the patient was

714
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,760
intoxicated rather that they had a

715
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,000
severe brain bleed um so when we

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
realized that information we opted to

717
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
upgrade our response and we

718
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
tried to get a helicopter for uh

719
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,159
to expedite that response to get the

720
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,120
patient to the hospital faster

721
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,760
um cool just to wrap things up here

722
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
um so there's a lot of uh information

723
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
and stories um why does this all matter

724
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
one thing that i found as software

725
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,679
companies grow

726
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,640
the

727
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
more issues happen and the more complex

728
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
those issues get

729
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
because of that it's important to have

730
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
some tool set to address them

731
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,600
so creating dedicated incident response

732
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,039
i think can be a really helpful tool for

733
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
streamlining the process

734
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,039
they can also be stressful and having a

735
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,720
blameless culture in which that stress

736
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
is manageable

737
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,640
i think is completely necessary for that

738
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
growth

739
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,440
and lastly what i'd say uh is that

740
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
these incidents are a natural part of

741
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,159
any software organization it's not fun

742
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,000
as an engineer when you ship code that

743
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,279
you thought was gonna work as expected

744
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,919
but it didn't but to air as human uh and

745
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,840
to uh it's important to build and learn

746
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,720
from those experiences

747
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,840
as a shameless plug a common room is

748
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,919
hiring please let me know if you're

749
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,360
interested in a role we are building

750
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,840
some pretty cool stuff

751
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,720
and thank you all for listening

752
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,559
and i am going to leave some time for

753
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,559
questions
