1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,360
welcome everyone

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,279
today we are going to talk about

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,559
internet of things or threads

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,639
the basic purpose of this talk is to

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,040
understand the design and structure of

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,280
iot partners

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,039
we are going to focus on

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,279
different techniques and tactics opted

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,880
by attackers

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,240
to launch

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,599
attacks using iot devices

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,439
but first of all

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,599
i am really thankful to hack in paris

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
security conference committee members

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
for giving me this opportunity to

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,280
present this research in front of you

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
i hope in the next

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
one hour or so we are going to have a

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
great time ahead understanding

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
the iot thirds

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
so let's get it started

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
before moving further i would like to

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
call a disclaimer here

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,199
the research that we are going to

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
present in this talk

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
is basically

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,720
sharing

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,439
security research with the community

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
and building more intelligence so that

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
we can support attacks in the real time

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
the purpose is very simple that we have

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,000
to build strong's prevention

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,799
and detection security solution

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,200
so that we can protect our critical

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,840
assets

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,119
against internet attacks

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
so let's move forward

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,798
and start our discussion

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
a brief background of mine i've been in

40
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
this industry for 14 years

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,920
written

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
two or three different books the recent

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
one is empirical cloud security

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,880
previous one was targeted cyber attacks

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,320
with that if you are interested in going

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
more about the work that have been done

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
in the recent years you can visit the

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,280
bottom

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
or you can follow me on twitter as well

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
otherwise you can just check my profile

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
on linkedin to understand

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,919
what we have been doing in this field

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,560
and why we are going to talk about iot

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
threats

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
based on the research that we have

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,200
conducted in recent times

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
so what is the agenda

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
so in this talk we're going to focus on

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,239
understanding iot threads

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
we will understand how we really need to

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,000
go ahead and hunt iot botnets

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
we're also going to talk about in detail

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
attack mechanisms and characteristics of

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
different iot bots

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
then we'll take a look into different

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
iot partner cnc panels

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
we will have a few demos as well

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,760
highlighting

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
how these iot botnet command and control

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
panels look like

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
but let's first start with the iot

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
threads

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
in recent times you must have realized

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,159
the attacks utilizing iot devices as

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
launch pads have increased exponentially

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,159
a few media headlines have been

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,959
presented here to show how critical this

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
problem is

79
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
well personally i always believe that in

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
order to solve any sort of problem we

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
really need to formulate the problem

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
very well

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,440
and then comes the solution

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
right now the way digital evolution is

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
happening

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
or you can say digital transformation is

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,239
happening

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,239
the internet is fetching with more and

89
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,280
more iot devices which means

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
the attack landscape is changing as well

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,959
more iot devices on the internet more

92
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
they are going to be targeted by

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,920
attackers and that's a serious problem

94
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
so the question that comes to play is

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
how we are going to secure these iot

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
devices thereby making sure

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
that we are going to have a strong

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
security all around and we circumvent

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,280
cyber attacks

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
however

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,799
these headlines

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,879
explicitly states that

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,920
how

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,279
exactly the problem exists in this world

105
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,120
at the moment

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
and in which direction we really need to

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,560
move forward

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
but the problem is real

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,120
and for that we have to invest lot into

110
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,600
security research and intelligence

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,280
gathering activities

112
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,800
so that

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,800
we can build strong security solutions

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
now let's first understand how we as a

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
security researcher we need to hunt iot

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,199
pods

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
there are myriad of techniques that you

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
can obtain

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
but as a part of this talk we are going

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,560
to discuss few

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
so what we have seen based on our

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
research that

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
attackers are hosting iot bots as a

124
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
simple resources as a files

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,759
on the web servers that can be easily

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,240
indexed

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,199
interestingly anonymous ftp servers are

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,400
also being used by attackers to host

129
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
iot malware

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,160
interestingly with http and ftp

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
protocols you can also generate direct

132
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
downloadable links which can be

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
distributed all across

134
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
for example you can actually generate a

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,680
direct link

136
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
and from the iot device you can use

137
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,400
standard utilities like wget or girl to

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
download

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
the iot bots on those compromised iot

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,280
devices

141
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
we'll talk more about it later later on

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
another technique while analyzing iot

143
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,600
binaries

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,280
is to extract hard-coded ip addresses

145
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
these ip addresses can be used for

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
command and control communication

147
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,400
and once you have that information you

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
can extract interesting artifacts out of

149
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
that as well because you can connect

150
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
back to cnc panel and then actually

151
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
conduct penetration testing or some kind

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
of additional assessment

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,240
to generate more intelligence out of it

154
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
memory forensics is an important

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,639
technique as well while running iot

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
malware on the devices you can dump the

157
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
memory you can analyze the memory and

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,919
you can extract a lot of interesting

159
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,440
information out of it as well

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
identification reconnaissance is also

161
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
very important because if you see some

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
kind of like malicious communication

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,000
happening from iot device

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,880
you can conduct scanning in the same

165
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,520
vicinity of those ip addresses

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
and then try to see how the network

167
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
traffic is being generated and you can

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,479
detect anomalies in that as well

169
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,599
with that

170
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
it becomes also easy for the security

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,599
researcher to find the administrative

172
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,880
panels

173
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
for example you can use telnet ftp http

174
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
to connect back to the cnc panel and see

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
how it looks like

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
broad scanning is also an important

177
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
technique

178
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
where we just run conduct mass scanning

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
and then try to you know feed some sort

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,120
of signatures and see how effectively a

181
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
particular iot botnet in faction is

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
occurring

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
so there are many ways you can go ahead

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
and you know detect and hunt iot bots

185
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,560
but it is required because until unless

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
you have the good set of information it

187
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
is not possible

188
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
to build intelligence

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to support iot partnered in factions

190
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
continuing on the same part we are going

191
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
to talk about

192
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
little bit doing more than what we have

193
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
did with the iot binaries earlier it's

194
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,879
more focused on cnc panels

195
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
like can you compromise the iot partner

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
cnc panels can you detect some sort of

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,080
vulnerabilities in those cnc panels

198
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
and there are a couple of techniques

199
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
that you can use there as well

200
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,840
interestingly you can go after

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
compromising the front-end interfaces

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
which are used to call as you know the

203
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
very first time you want to log in back

204
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
into the cnc panel it can be web-based

205
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
dnc panel it can utilize telnet as a

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
protocol it can you know use other

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
customized protocols

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
so you need to comprom you need to go

209
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
ahead and compromise that in order to

210
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
extract more information

211
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
another interesting technique is that

212
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,599
you can actually target the backend

213
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
databases

214
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
as you all know you know when these iot

215
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
cnc panels are collecting lot of

216
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
information from the compromised devices

217
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
they need to store that information

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
somewhere

219
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,560
mostly databases are used as we all know

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
and you can attack those data databases

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
directly if they're connected on the

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
internet to gain a complete control over

223
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
the backend architecture in this case is

224
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
the tier 3 play which is database

225
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
and if you compromise the database you

226
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
know you can dump cnc panel

227
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,399
you know admin credentials you know you

228
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,920
can get a lot of other interesting

229
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,240
information about data exfiltration you

230
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
know stolen data and sort of those

231
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
things

232
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,399
another interesting technique is to

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
simply go for vulnerability exploitation

234
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,560
in the form of like remote command

235
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
execution

236
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,560
the id in this case is very simple it's

237
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
just like exploiting any sort of

238
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
vulnerabilities in the associated

239
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,560
software that are being consumed by cnc

240
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,959
panels

241
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
we reuse credential approaches imported

242
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
artifact as well

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,399
sometimes what we have seen that you

244
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,600
know

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
the attackers are using weak or default

246
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
passwords or they reuse the same set of

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
passwords

248
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
for cnc panels

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
so you can target that

250
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
point as well

251
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
so combined with all the techniques that

252
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
we have discussed for analyzing it bots

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
but some of the techniques that can be

254
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
utilized to

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
go ahead

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
and attack the cnc panels

257
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
in both scenarios you can collect a lot

258
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
of interesting information

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
to build threat intelligence

260
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,079
now moving forward

261
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,920
we are going to talk about

262
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,839
interesting attack mechanisms and

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
characteristics of iot

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
bots very important

265
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
i will reiterate again it is essential

266
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
to understand

267
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
the different techniques

268
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
these bots soft basically how attackers

269
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
design these bots

270
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
to conduct nefarious operations on the

271
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
compromised iot devices

272
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,719
so let's talk about in more detail

273
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
before

274
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
going deep into it it is important to

275
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,519
understand

276
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,680
the model and the attack execution of an

277
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
iot partner

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
so general purpose the way attackers are

279
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
going after they found some sort of a

280
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
vulnerability in one iot device they

281
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
build a signature and then they launch

282
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
mass scanning activity

283
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
try to fingerprint the one level iot

284
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,160
devices on the internet

285
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
if we talk about a broad base attack you

286
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,880
know the iot devices

287
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
can be of different type it can be a

288
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,120
router it can be a camera it can be some

289
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
other you know dvr devices

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
and once these devices are compromised

291
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
the attackers use these devices

292
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
as launch pads to trigger denial of

293
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
service attacks

294
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
trigger additional set of attack like

295
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,079
launching more scanning activities

296
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
launching brute force attacks on other

297
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,560
targeted devices so such sort of a chain

298
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,800
reaction

299
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
and now once you understand how the iot

300
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,399
botnets work

301
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,839
and the attack

302
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,320
executes

303
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,640
it is essential and very important for

304
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
us to understand the techniques

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,560
how these bots operate on those

306
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
compromised devices right

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
let's take a look into it

308
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
so as a part of a

309
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,320
variety of techniques we are going to

310
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
talk about all these things in detail

311
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
with appropriate examples from the real

312
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
world

313
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
and the idea is to show whatever we are

314
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
going to discuss as attack mechanisms

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,399
and the characteristics these are taken

316
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
if n have been seen in the real world

317
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
some of the examples will

318
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
make it more

319
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
explainable when you look at it

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
and you will realize right all these

321
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
techniques are opted

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
by the attackers

323
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
to generate and design very

324
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,120
sophisticated iot bots so let's get it

325
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
started there

326
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
okay

327
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
so let's first understand

328
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,639
the distribution of iot boundaries

329
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
in the early part of the talk we

330
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,920
discussed about you know the techniques

331
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,200
that security researchers need to use

332
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
to map these

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
exposed web servers that are hosting iot

334
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
parts

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
now let's take a little bit more deep

336
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
dive into it if you look at these

337
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,320
examples you can clearly see

338
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
the web

339
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,720
server is hosting different set of files

340
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
a simple resources

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,480
and there's no authentication and

342
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,959
authorization controls in place

343
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,560
which means if you have a direct

344
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
downloadable link available

345
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,800
you can fetch these files

346
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
directly

347
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,839
i think similarly

348
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,200
the attackers

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
once they compromise the iot device

350
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
they fetch the files which in case is

351
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,200
the iot parts directly to the

352
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,680
compromised iot device and executes them

353
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,639
and you can imagine like the one

354
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
downloadable link can be distributed

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
across millions of devices

356
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,600
which they can fetch it and install the

357
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
malicious payload and become as a part

358
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,480
of the iot botnet

359
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,399
if you look at this particular example

360
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
here this actually shows

361
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,800
what are the contents of infected.sh

362
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
file

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,680
and this

364
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,839
typically relates to the fact that you

365
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,440
know the various commands that are

366
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
available in the shell file which are

367
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
going to get executed

368
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,839
once it is downloaded on the compromise

369
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,320
device

370
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
let's take into look into another

371
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
example

372
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
in this particular case you can clearly

373
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
see

374
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
the iot binaries are distributed

375
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,160
but just take a look at the

376
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,519
naming convention of these files

377
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
dns dns scan ldapaldevscan which are the

378
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
naming convention used for legitimate

379
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
tools

380
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
but in fact

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
these are iot ports or you can call as

382
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
like malicious payloads

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
so these get downloaded onto the

384
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
compromised iot devices and once you

385
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,160
execute them

386
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
you know

387
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,279
the compromise iot device becomes more

388
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
powerful because now it's gonna perform

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,839
some actions which are

390
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,160
unauthorized and then it can be used to

391
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
do things

392
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
which are not legitimate

393
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
but these are the variations we are also

394
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,399
seeing all across

395
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,000
where we look into the distribution mode

396
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,480
of iot binaries

397
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
now look at this example

398
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
in this particular case we are focusing

399
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
primarily on the compromised host that

400
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,720
are running on the cloud in this case is

401
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
just a

402
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
google cloud

403
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
and you can clearly see attackers are

404
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,320
also exploiting

405
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,680
the exposed host

406
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,279
that are running on the internet on

407
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,040
these cloud providers

408
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
and when you are these uh

409
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
hosts are not secured appropriately

410
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,680
they get compromised

411
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,519
and then been utilized by attackers to

412
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,839
host iot parts

413
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,360
and this example

414
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,320
actually

415
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
reflect that

416
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
and it's just not only the one cloud

417
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
let's take a look into the another

418
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,920
example

419
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
in this case is an ec2 instance

420
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,759
we're just running a web server

421
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
as you can clearly see here

422
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
and then

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,800
it also highlights what is the

424
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,560
content of a one specific file

425
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
and once you you know the dig example

426
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,959
highlights that the ip belongs to the

427
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,279
amazon ec2 instance

428
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
i mean these two instances can be

429
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,639
controlled and operated by the customers

430
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
but the major and the primary point that

431
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
what we want to highlight here is

432
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,560
attackers are going after these

433
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,518
resources as well

434
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
so it's just not only you have to secure

435
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,040
your data centers but you also want to

436
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
make sure that even you are hosting and

437
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,399
running instances on cloud providers is

438
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,279
the responsibility of the organizations

439
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,360
to make sure these ec2 instances are

440
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,560
secure

441
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
we have seen many examples like that

442
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
where ec2 instances or the instances

443
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,680
running in google environment are

444
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,959
compromised

445
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,399
and are distributing

446
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,199
iot parts

447
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,520
so let's move forward

448
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,119
another interesting technique that what

449
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,799
we have seen

450
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
is the packing right

451
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,280
so when you

452
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,559
when the attackers actually download the

453
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
payload

454
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,799
onto the compromised iot devices the

455
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
payload is actually packed

456
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
and we all know why packing is being

457
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,919
used is just to ensure that you know

458
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,240
nobody can reverse engineer it or it

459
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,480
becomes very difficult to

460
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
look into what is the content of that

461
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
payload is

462
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
in this example

463
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
what we have seen that upx packer is

464
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
being used

465
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,640
and if you

466
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960
take a look at it

467
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
the screenshot here

468
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
and when you just simply use the command

469
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
file it actually gives you what the

470
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
payload is all about

471
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
and as we all know you know the file

472
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,600
command is based on the magic headers is

473
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
going to check the you know thomas

474
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
header of the file and

475
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,120
try to check it with the existing

476
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
database making sure what kind of file

477
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
it is irrespective of what the extension

478
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,080
is

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,240
and you can clearly see you know when we

480
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
grab and get all these strings and then

481
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
look into it the

482
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
payload was packed with upx

483
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
so this actually highlights

484
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
that attackers when they're designing

485
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,719
iot pods are using

486
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
packers as well

487
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,280
to ensure the integrity is maintained

488
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,000
for the malicious payload

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
and as a security researcher when you

490
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,280
are doing this kind of activity you need

491
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
to make sure you look into all these

492
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
aspects

493
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,240
find a way to unpack it so that you can

494
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,200
get a

495
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,679
internal details about the payload

496
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,559
and how it works

497
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,760
so but packing is being utilized by

498
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,280
attackers for this kind of activity

499
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,080
another interesting artifact what we

500
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
have seen

501
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
is

502
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
the exploits are embedded in the iot box

503
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,799
itself

504
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
which means

505
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
if the attackers have compromised a one

506
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,960
iot device and it is installing

507
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,919
additional payloads

508
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
or a very sophisticated iot bot that it

509
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,000
has designed onto the compromised device

510
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,480
once that payload

511
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,880
is executed on the compromised device

512
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
the payload has a built-in feature

513
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,559
of

514
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,720
different exploits which can be

515
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
triggered against additional set of

516
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
devices on the internet

517
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
so the attacker is utilizing the one

518
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,960
compromise iot device

519
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
as a launch pad

520
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
and at attacking

521
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
myriad of other devices on the internet

522
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
by running scanning activity and

523
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,440
exploiting on the fly

524
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,919
and all these additional devices become

525
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,160
a part of the botnet

526
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
and the

527
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,160
target

528
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,559
is grown

529
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,799
which means that the botnet grows with

530
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,480
passage of time

531
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,679
and then

532
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,000
the collective power can be harnessed to

533
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
attack

534
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,120
different things on the internet

535
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,960
in this particular example if you see

536
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,840
the bot has in a built-in exploit for a

537
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
specific

538
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
router

539
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
in this case is the linksys outdoor

540
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
explode

541
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
once you reverse engineer the iot binary

542
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
you will see that you know okay this

543
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
binary has some sort of problem with it

544
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
because it is going to execute and

545
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
exploit against

546
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
linksys routers

547
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,919
and now you can going to start building

548
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,520
your intelligence with that

549
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
but whenever you are analyzing iot

550
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
binary make sure you are going to scan

551
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,799
that bindery and you are going to

552
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,039
analyze that binary for known or unknown

553
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,640
exploits that are embedded into it

554
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,720
very very important

555
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
and needed

556
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,360
another important technique that what we

557
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
have seen is the self-deletion

558
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,840
capability what that exactly means

559
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
so whenever the payload gets executed

560
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,520
onto the compromised iot device

561
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
it performs as activities and then it

562
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,000
has in a shell script

563
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
or a shell command

564
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,240
that it is going to auto delete itself

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
once it has

566
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
successfully operated

567
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,799
this is done to ensure that you know the

568
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,640
infection have successfully triggered in

569
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,240
the iot device

570
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,720
but you are not going to get some of the

571
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,039
associated files because those are files

572
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,720
have been deleted

573
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,559
after the execution

574
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,799
and if you look at the

575
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,799
screenshot here you can clearly see

576
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,320
that a temp directory

577
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,000
and several other directories are going

578
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,120
to have some sort of operation

579
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
executed by the attacker

580
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,679
and it is just not only going to you

581
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
know fetch the file but once it is

582
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
executed it is going to delete that file

583
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,640
as well with the command remove hyphen

584
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,919
rf

585
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,440
and this is a part of the technique of

586
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
self deletion and removal

587
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
basically the attacker want to you know

588
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
remove all the traces

589
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
associated with the file that has been

590
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
executed on the iot device

591
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,799
of course the compromised

592
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
one iot device

593
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,159
as a researcher you need to ensure that

594
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,159
whenever you are analyzing these kind of

595
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,400
binaries or payloads you should look for

596
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,919
these kind of

597
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,919
techniques

598
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,400
and build intelligence accordingly

599
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
very very important to look into these

600
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,840
kind of capabilities

601
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
now we can little bit also shift gears

602
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
what kind of traffic that you can see on

603
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
the network

604
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,520
we have seen iot bots are capable of

605
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,320
launching mass scans

606
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
in this

607
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
two examples that we what we have

608
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
presented here you can clearly see tcp

609
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,200
network connection to the

610
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,480
port 5555 which means it's an android

611
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,679
debug port

612
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
so the compromise iot device is

613
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,400
launching a mass scanning against

614
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,159
one level android devices on the

615
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
internet similarly

616
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,320
in the second example it's the telnet

617
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,919
as we discussed the concept earlier

618
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,000
attacker is launching a compromise iot

619
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
device to target tablet

620
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,120
services

621
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
on the additional set of iot devices

622
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,559
either it can be a brute force attack it

623
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,280
can be a password cracking attempts it

624
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,279
can be an a kind of

625
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,320
running an exploit against those devices

626
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,360
but the target is very very clear

627
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
so the attacker is saying if i'm going

628
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
to get into your system onto your iot

629
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,679
devices i'm going to

630
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
utilize it for nefarious purposes and

631
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
this is what is happening

632
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
so as a researcher when you are

633
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
analyzing this kind of network traffic

634
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
you need to ensure that you will look

635
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
for all these kind of

636
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,080
patterns inside the network traffic and

637
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,919
ensure that where it is originating from

638
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,919
and what kind of activities happening

639
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,279
from the network

640
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,039
typically focusing on iot devices

641
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,240
the next one

642
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,679
as we all know

643
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,080
what they are going to do when i say the

644
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,640
word they which means attackers when

645
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
they are going to compromise millions of

646
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,840
iot devices on the internet

647
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
law service is one of the most adamant

648
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,720
attack that they actually trigger

649
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
because at the end of the day

650
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
they are just compromised the

651
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,440
additional iot devices on on the

652
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,880
internet

653
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
as attackers are not the owners of those

654
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,279
iot devices but they control the power

655
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,919
of those iot devices

656
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,520
and if they control the power they are

657
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
going to utilize it for some sort of

658
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,520
purposes in this case

659
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
it is unauthorized

660
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,600
attacks

661
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
so your attacker can direct

662
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,279
the iot devices running iot bots to

663
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,360
actually go after and launch distributed

664
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
denial of service attacks

665
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,120
so in this example what we have

666
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
highlighted their

667
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760
variety of

668
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,640
denial of service attacks are being

669
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,720
utilized by

670
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,840
attackers

671
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,919
and they can pick up whatever they want

672
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,080
and then they can direct the partner to

673
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,640
actually trigger those

674
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,559
and we have seen this all across

675
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,799
so whenever you're analyzing it you

676
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
really need to look for these kind of

677
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,880
things as well

678
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
another very interesting artifact what

679
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,679
we have analyzed is

680
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,919
the use usage of system tools

681
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
the attackers

682
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
exploit the power of inherent operating

683
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,440
system in the form of tools and utilize

684
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,200
it for conducting

685
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
unauthorized operations

686
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,919
what i mean by that is that once the iot

687
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,000
device is compromised

688
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
it has some sort of underlying operating

689
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
system

690
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,080
it could be a variant of linux unix

691
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
depending on the

692
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,279
design

693
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,600
so what attackers do in those kind of

694
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
scenarios

695
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,919
they utilize the system tools

696
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,840
like the

697
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,320
bash interpreter they can utilize curl

698
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,960
tool they can use wget tool

699
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
so as you remember in the earlier part

700
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,799
of the talk

701
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,480
when we talked when we discussed about

702
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
xposed web

703
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,320
server running

704
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,080
on the internet and they have actually

705
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,279
hosted

706
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,360
iot pods

707
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
so from the iot device you can simply

708
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,159
use the wget or curl tool to fetch the

709
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,240
additional payloads from the exposed web

710
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,799
servers onto the compromised iot device

711
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,240
and nobody is going to

712
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,679
prevent it

713
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,200
because of the way the network traffic

714
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
rules are being set up

715
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
so you can clearly see how attackers

716
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,880
utilize the system tools in this

717
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
scenario as well the couple of examples

718
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,600
are highlighted here you can see wget

719
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,080
you can see bz box you can see

720
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,760
uh base64 decoder you can see python

721
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,919
so it's so easy for attackers to run

722
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,000
python code on the compromised iot

723
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
devices as long as they support it

724
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
and you know bzbox is like a power play

725
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,399
in that sense as well because it has a

726
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,799
lot of inherent utilities that it can

727
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,159
support and then you can actually go

728
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,200
after running the code

729
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,039
uninterrupted

730
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,120
so attackers don't have to worry about

731
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,960
he i need some additional tools or

732
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
associated set of tools to just run my

733
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
scripts or payloads no it's all

734
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,360
available on the iot devices and they're

735
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
going to utilize it so make sure

736
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,399
whenever you're

737
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,760
analyzing iot boundaries

738
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,159
you actually go for these kind of

739
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
patterns and

740
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
information as well

741
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,360
so now i'm gonna take a little bit

742
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,520
you know a break here in the sense

743
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
let's talk about a bit of fun and profit

744
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,919
scenario

745
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,360
so let's say if you are not going to go

746
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,799
after uh cnc panel compromise can we go

747
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
for a crash or a kill what i mean by

748
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,399
that is

749
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,360
sometimes attackers have secured the cnc

750
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,080
panels effectively

751
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,159
but the way these panels are designed

752
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,880
the network services are being running

753
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
there is some sort of vulnerability

754
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,640
exists with it

755
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,720
and as a researcher as a threat

756
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
intelligence expert

757
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
or as a security operations center

758
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
analyst

759
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
you can respond differently as well all

760
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,480
right

761
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
now let's take a look into this case

762
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,279
study it is based on the fact that

763
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,120
mirai cnc panel code has been reused by

764
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,480
a lot of additional iot

765
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,039
botnets

766
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
what we have seen in the recent times as

767
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,240
well there's one of the network specific

768
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
services that are being consumed by

769
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
mirai

770
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,360
one can crash it

771
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,520
so what exactly that means it means

772
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,440
there's just some inherent vulnerability

773
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
exist in there

774
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
if you're not able to compromise

775
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,320
the cnc panel directly

776
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,679
for whatever the reasons are because

777
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
they're secure efficiently attackers

778
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
have strong

779
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,039
authentication and authorization

780
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,799
controls in place

781
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,640
but as a researcher you can still target

782
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,120
the network service and can bring down

783
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,159
the mirai panel down

784
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:40,960
so

785
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,200
if you look at this simple code that

786
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
what we have presented here

787
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
is creating a socket and all is just

788
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
doing it sending up a buffer on a

789
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,679
continuous basis and then stopping it up

790
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,760
once we put this thing in a loop it is

791
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,240
keep on sending the buffer and attacking

792
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,080
the network surface

793
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,159
making sure there is some sort of

794
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,520
overflow

795
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,000
happens

796
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
in our testing what we have seen in

797
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,760
certain versions of mirai i think it can

798
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
crash the service and make it

799
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,199
unavailable for some period of time

800
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,159
so the basic

801
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,279
target here is to show it's not always

802
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
that you can go for controlling the cnc

803
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,320
panel for extracting intelligence but

804
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
you can respond efficiently

805
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,960
in other ways as well

806
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
and this one case study highlights that

807
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
as well

808
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,880
i hope you can try that as well

809
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,520
and enjoy and see how it looks like

810
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,159
when you analyzing some sort of mirai

811
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,360
panel

812
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,279
running on the internet

813
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,679
all right

814
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,960
now we are going to look into

815
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,039
different iot cnc panels

816
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,360
now you will see how exactly these

817
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,679
botnet cnc panels look like

818
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,799
once you compromise them

819
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,559
let's see

820
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,200
in this one example

821
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,880
you can see

822
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,559
the different modules that are being

823
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,918
supported by the goon iot partner

824
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
so when you run a simple command like

825
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
your parts on the cnc panel of this iot

826
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,760
partner you can clearly see you know how

827
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
many

828
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
different infections are there and what

829
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,760
kind of

830
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,480
variation of

831
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
iot binary

832
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
is being distributed

833
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,880
and different modules at sports related

834
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,120
to denial of service related to other

835
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,960
side of things

836
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,480
so generally it has a modules like

837
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,600
methods admin bots rules you know clear

838
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,159
screen logout and different sporting

839
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,640
commands

840
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,519
but this is how exactly the iot cnc

841
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,080
panel looks like

842
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,000
let's take a look into another example

843
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,519
as well

844
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
this one is related to the verizon iot

845
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,840
partner

846
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,399
once you get an access to it you can

847
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,120
clearly see

848
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,880
what exactly it supports you can get a

849
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,360
total number of infections where the iot

850
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
bots are running

851
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,440
how you can actually utilized

852
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,360
to launch it in la la service which

853
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,840
exactly attacker do but as a researcher

854
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,120
you can figure it out how to build

855
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
intelligence out of it

856
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
and then circumvent these infections

857
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,559
accordingly

858
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,799
but this is how exactly the iot partner

859
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,720
cnc panel looked like

860
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,200
let's take a look into another example

861
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,360
this one is related to the vivid iot

862
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,840
partner

863
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,240
once you get inside into this iot

864
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,320
partner cnc panel you can clearly see

865
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,360
how it looks like in faction numbers

866
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
modular sports which we have just

867
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,519
discussed but it is also advertising a

868
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,200
bit as well you know what is the monthly

869
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,080
plan you can use it so in this case

870
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,399
attackers can actually provide this as a

871
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,320
service

872
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,760
and in

873
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
our community we used to call as a

874
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,279
crimeware as a service because in this

875
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,039
case

876
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,519
they don't have to work on you know

877
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,320
installing the cnc panel getting to you

878
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,000
know finding and distributing in

879
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
factions while they just simply go ahead

880
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,760
and rent out this

881
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,600
infrastructure and just pay them the

882
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,080
service under the hood of crimeware as a

883
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,519
service

884
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,640
so

885
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,240
very important to understand from the

886
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
perspective of threat intelligence but

887
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,200
this all exists in this world

888
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
and some of these examples what we have

889
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,159
provided validates that

890
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,159
now we have looked into

891
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,399
some of the example of iot partners cnc

892
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,760
panels

893
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,200
so what next

894
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
we are going to liquidism to the

895
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
demonstration

896
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,279
focusing on

897
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,159
how inherently cnc panels are designed

898
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,519
and how it looks like in a real world

899
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,240
is a part of our demonstrations but

900
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,480
before moving further i will reiterate

901
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
what we have discussed so far

902
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,239
so we started with

903
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,760
analyzing iot partner threat landscape

904
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
we discussed some of the techniques

905
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,480
related to iot partner hunting

906
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,399
and compromising cnc panels

907
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,440
then we took a shift when we analyze

908
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,199
understanding what is the iot partner

909
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,199
attack execution model

910
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,440
and the different attack tactics and

911
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
techniques including mechanisms

912
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,480
opted by attackers to design iot pods

913
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,320
after that we looked into

914
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,639
one of the simple case study for fun and

915
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,320
profit

916
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,719
of mariah botnin how you can even go

917
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,599
after and kill the service

918
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,520
once we did all that

919
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,599
we shifted our gears towards analyzing

920
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,320
iot partners cnc panels

921
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,240
what are the inherent design how it

922
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,280
works

923
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
different kind of modules and support

924
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,960
now

925
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,480
let's look into the demonstration

926
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
in this example

927
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,320
what we are going to highlight

928
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
is how the verizon iot board cnc panel

929
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
look like in a real time

930
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,240
just enjoy the video and see how it

931
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,479
looks like

932
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:46,160
[Music]

933
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,920
different tools exposed right now

934
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,760
different attack methods that are

935
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,280
available for launching denial of

936
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,839
service attacks

937
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,520
and that's all for now it's a short and

938
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,359
press video to highlight when you log in

939
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,839
back into the cnc panel how it looks

940
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,680
like how you really need to run commands

941
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,880
and see

942
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,040
what is available there

943
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,800
so let's move forward

944
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
and look into the another example this

945
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,720
one is a bit detailed one because what

946
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,960
we are going to show right now is a

947
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
number of iot partners cnc panel here

948
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,480
and you will

949
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,280
get more information like it's just not

950
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
only the one iot cnc panel for the uh

951
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,680
botnet there are myriad out there just

952
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,640
enjoy this video

953
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,359
[Music]

954
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,440
you can see variation

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,240
exactly here

956
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:51,110
[Music]

957
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,480
so this is a kawari botnet

958
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,560
as you can see on the screen as well

959
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,200
[Music]

960
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
now log in back into the cnc panel of

961
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,640
other content

962
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,280
there we go

963
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
this one is

964
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
another example of

965
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,319
iot partner cnc panel

966
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,520
you can see the

967
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
number of infections which was kind of

968
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,560
in early stages

969
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,720
modules

970
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,359
it sports

971
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,880
another example of the deck net iot

972
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,480
partner

973
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,880
let's see

974
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,920
we just have only 48 infections early

975
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,400
stages

976
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,640
and then it comes the message from the

977
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
iot

978
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,960
botnet administrator

979
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,359
so overall what we have highlighted here

980
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,000
is how these iot barnet cnc panels look

981
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,520
like

982
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,680
it's not easy to actually get access to

983
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
the cnc panels because you have to do a

984
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
lot of work earlier to build

985
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,160
intelligence finding where the cnc

986
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,000
panels are located

987
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
by analyzing boundaries by analyzing

988
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,839
network traffic by conducting reverse

989
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,680
engineering and all the techniques and

990
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,359
tactics that we have discussed earlier

991
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,119
the primary purpose

992
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,960
for this kind of

993
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
work is to

994
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,800
build intelligence

995
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,560
making sure

996
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,440
that we remain two steps ahead

997
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,520
of our adversaries

998
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
in making our internet infrastructure

999
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,759
secure

1000
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,839
so with that

1001
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,720
what's the inference out here

1002
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,800
after digging so deep into the world of

1003
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,119
iot partners

1004
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
we believe that there's a

1005
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
requirement and there is a need for

1006
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,079
building multi-facet approach

1007
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,520
to generate intelligence

1008
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,640
in order to subvert and defend

1009
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,839
against threats in the iot hemisphere

1010
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,040
we cannot circumvent

1011
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,800
the attacks that are targeted against

1012
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,680
iot devices by just following one way or

1013
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,760
one model of security

1014
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
apart from defense and that we need

1015
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,480
multi-facet approach

1016
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,520
we need to look into all aspects of iot

1017
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
device design

1018
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
and making sure

1019
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,520
we obtain visibility into each and every

1020
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,040
aspect of it

1021
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,119
making sure

1022
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,440
security controls are implemented

1023
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,040
very effectively and efficiently

1024
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,920
and this is the message i always prefer

1025
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,000
to give

1026
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,079
being in this industry for more than 14

1027
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,040
years

1028
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
this is the reality of the security

1029
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,119
world

1030
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,400
it is nothing new out there

1031
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,720
but it is actually up to you whether you

1032
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,359
really want to do it or not

1033
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,599
for example if you're simply

1034
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,960
doing some sort of configuration change

1035
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
have you validated it efficiently

1036
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
have you make sure that the

1037
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,480
configuration

1038
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,800
is not gonna impact the security

1039
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,040
and if we revert it back to the simple

1040
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,319
concept it's all about how you want to

1041
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,560
do security

1042
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,800
how much understanding you have about

1043
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
your security

1044
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
and that is the target approach nothing

1045
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,160
new

1046
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,079
but it's the way you do it and that's

1047
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,520
why we believe that

1048
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,839
security is a continuous process not a

1049
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,640
one-time shot it's a long shot that you

1050
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,119
have to actually go after

1051
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,680
on continuous basis

1052
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,800
with that

1053
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,119
any questions and queries you have

1054
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,000
i'll be more than happy to discuss

1055
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
i'm really looking forward for your

1056
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,920
feedback

1057
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,319
and to understand how you feel about

1058
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,520
this talk

1059
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,280
any suggestion you have so that we can

1060
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
learn from each other

1061
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,760
and with that thank you very much

1062
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,599
i would like to

1063
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,280

for creating such a fantastic conference

1067
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
and allowing researchers to utilize the

1068
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,800
podium for sharing the research work

1069
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,920
once again

1070
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,359
