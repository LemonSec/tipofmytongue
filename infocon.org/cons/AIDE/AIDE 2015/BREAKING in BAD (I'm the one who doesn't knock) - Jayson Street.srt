1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,570
ozzie tried to keep it to 45 minutes

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,670
but like but last time I gave this talk
it was like

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,880
well hour-ish okay

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,759
I'm tryin I am so this is my legal
disclaimer

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,570
I am not a lawyer but I've Google on the
internet so

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,740
this is the best proximity over legal
disclaimer I could come up with

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,340
basically what this state's is I am NOT
a bad guy

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,050
I am a good guy who is paid to be a bad
guy so I will never try to steal from

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,450
you kill you or

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,670
destroy you in less you pay me first are
so when I talk about

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,070
examples and things I've done this sound
really horrible and mean and Mike I

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,360
can't believe he just did that

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,660
I was paid to do that from the client to
do it to themselves so

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,289
I'll don't do these things unless you
have authorization

15
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,860
I i think one the biggest ways I think
between a

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,239
a hacker in a criminal about the the key
thing is permission

17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,920
so I have permission as you can tell
there's already a theme

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,820
%uh tell the talk is breaking in bad I'm
the one who doesn't knock

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,479
if you don't know what the Breaking Bad
TV show is

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,549
I it's going to be really weird for you
because I just that my whole theme

21
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,049
a bit hope we are familiar with a lil
bit about %uh Breaking Bad

22
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:21,990
and then you're like at least chuckle
halfway through which would be nice

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,299
I'll Who Am I I

24
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,250
that's what Google for it's like the
main thing you know is

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,200
I am a guy who likes to do not just read
team but blue team so this talk

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,049
even though it's often seven talks about
so things I do from

27
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,600
up the red team standpoint it's like the
end up but I actually give me some blue

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,240
team

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,840
knowledge I call this a last year was
moran talk this year I call this talk my

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,090
dessert vegetables because I give the
dessert first and then the vegetables

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,340
but now the abundantly clear I'll later
on

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,509
I want the other things I hate is

33
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,509
APT you know you know APT this APT that
APT is basically saying we got poem by

34
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,680
phishing scam but we want to make me
tell our investors you know there was an

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,530
advanced attack

36
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,989
so they'll cover it no feel better about
you know being attacked

37
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,170
I its but one easy see how all these
talks

38
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,329
and and all the things you keep seeing
Congress at the conference's

39
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:21,849
all these advanced techniques now it's
like oh well we've got this new

40
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:27,319
I'll a but injection step you know we
can take over a car we can go and take

41
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,110
over this earth like we can go hack
airplanes are side dragon it's like you

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,640
know you do all these advanced thinks

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,700
how many sites got attacked

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,109
in the last two or three years because
of some crazy zero-day inched up you

45
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:42,319
know besides the ones we did

46
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,209
Iran but besides those which wasn't
knocked out by

47
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,470
you know zero-day and which ones are bad
because I love

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,730
a phishing scam or common sequin jack
shit

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,209
people keep talking about low hanging
fruit

50
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,349
in my whole thing years screw the whole
a low-hanging fruit stepping up the

51
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,609
fruit is on the ground about the growing
up a tree

52
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:07,349
that's where we're at right now this
industry to stop talking my vans

53
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,739
the persistent threats and what I sum it
up with the is is like I do some basic

54
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,090
adorable destruction

55
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,379
I have been bad it's like I tried to be
the lowest common denominator during the

56
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:18,859
TAC

57
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,579
you could not go through wanna buy
attacks and be able to say

58
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,919
all that Jason he was like and advanced
super ninja cyber warrior stuffy nose

59
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,959
like how can we will stand that kind of
attack

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,480
usually after my tag alike really

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,239
that's all you did benami yes it is that
easy

62
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,739
and that we don't let me show you some
the basic steps about

63
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,480
being that these are the key indicators
a person being bad it's like

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,709
this is really bad for the court cuz I
can't read this but will go for

65
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,079
up number one step one rig on mode is
only about two hours a good one victim's

66
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,889
own website

67
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,239
but never used it for two hours yet ever
I

68
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,949
to St mode is usually walking the
victims location winging it

69
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,810
note sometimes without doing number one
I do that quite a bit

70
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,109
I will just like walk in go let's see
how this goes in years ago pretty well

71
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,599
three ponies mode is basically plug into
a bot device

72
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,620
into the victim computer network
sometimes with their help

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,030
mostly with their help of war 5

74
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,570
profit usually you know me cuz you know

75
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,360
paper this right so it's all good and
they get the proper because I get the

76
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,460
knowledge to get the understanding that
it has good the whole thing when the key

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,600
things about this is like

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,110
the reason why we do this is not because
it's just incredibly awesomely fun

79
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,930
but is also to help the personal clients
so they can become better

80
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,430
if you go into a location and you going
to a clients have you know and you tear

81
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,320
up until they destroy their network

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,330
and then a year later you go back n

83
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,780
and use the sum the sanctuary losing you
see someone the same

84
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,150
mistakes being made you failed

85
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,810
the client go shooting give them
obviously a proper information 7

86
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,820
educations upon what they had to fix

87
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,640
or the drug name 70 for them to fix that
so it's not just about

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,220
you know being able to break the end you
gotta be able to make sure you're

89
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,110
properly educating improperly telling
the client on how to fix these issues

90
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:20,230
so jobs let's go let's break down the
best approach is obviously bad

91
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,540
I want the key ones I love the most is
being the tech repair guy

92
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,810
it's like our delivery job customer you
know

93
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,080
or just I wander in I mean I will just
like all look at the open door looming

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,630
call and see what I can find up to

95
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,040
the all new executive positive force for
up where the tech report other tech and

96
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
repair guys usually the passive

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,450
rolled 70 I'm just trying to make some
help in order the

98
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,930
auditor executive policy for should
actually more with order role more

99
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,000
aggressive role

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,830
also very aggressive because the cars
usually maybe we're tying the fight

101
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,310
make you work I I will destroy you out
early are so it's like a side

102
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,440
don't like 'em i three crazy off the
wall personalities not recommended but

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,850
you know

104
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,580
really fun it's like i broken in two
places I in teenage mean eternal Gemma

105
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,310
bottoms barefoot in a t-shirt

106
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,280
I which has been really fun and I have
broken places

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,440
wearing an actual service that hacker on
it

108
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,560
I also your company's computer guy II
stolen a car one time

109
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,930
a

110
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,500
hotel with a shirt that said I'm a
liability so I you know

111
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,470
just really you should really be
thinking about this so

112
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,740
from does the three different per size
in what I decide to do

113
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,330
offer story time is to give me three
different

114
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,090
stories from three different countries
but of the one thing that they have in

115
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,590
common

116
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,300
their financial institutions or
organizations that deal with money

117
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,930
because

118
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,110
therefore they're going to be more
secure right because you know

119
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,050
there don't Monday it's like they're
also going to be more secure because you

120
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,039
know why do you

121
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,300
rob banks where the money's at right so
speaking to banks let's start off with

122
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,840
the first in which is the a

123
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,000
beirut bank job I hackers trip was nice
enough to turn this actually to a comic

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,660
book because its whole areas

125
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,900
I and basically out hard by Kyle a
client in Beirut Lebanon

126
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,930
to test their financial %uh systems and
their financial branches

127
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,259
and now Lebanon georgann Cypress it's
like whitman I spent like

128
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,919
about one month in five different
countries and stuff you know doing some

129
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,580
these engagements and I did this one

130
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,909
and I'll in beirut was pretty funny
because

131
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:30,190
they were like I don't blend well bear
by the way in case you haven't noticed

132
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,070
I don't speak arabic I don't speak
French Osos site we'll see how it goes

133
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,400
and this is one the first branches I did
cuz I was trying to show them how

134
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,770
a physical compromise could be to
financial compromise

135
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,030
other internal network systems I and I
love this one thing is seen from the

136
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,430
time that I walked in and looking at the

137
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,509
trying stamp to the time that I got
behind the teller line

138
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:00,280
two minutes 22 seconds two minutes

139
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,389
and 22 seconds from the time that I
walked in

140
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,479
I walked in I don't know the manager's
name

141
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,490
I've never been in this building before
I didn't know where anything was at

142
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,460
but heck let's see if it works right so
I walked in

143
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,270
walk straight down the hallway like a
new doc rose I'll always

144
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,060
when I'm walking I'm always walking I
know exactly where I'm going it's like

145
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,070
I've done that

146
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,810
completely yes the street to a dead in
like okay from walking this way now

147
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,970
you know it's like I've walk into those
that is before

148
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,729
this one didn't work out that bad walked
out for the manager's office door was

149
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,080
open or someone inside

00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:43,729
and information security and hacking
stuff I get to have to step

152
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,420
and I back out and I wait for about 30
seconds

153
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,900
right outside his door he had no idea
that I'm there

thousand dollars in cash

you know

172
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,950

177
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,660

that I was supposed to be there
everybody else is going on the

179
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,120
assumption that he's not going up says

207
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,889
a and on a side note 1 at one of the
saddest things I've ever

208
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,800
not the saddest and it's like us retire
with that later was

209
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,630
after this engagement was over it's like
I do security awareness engagement

210
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,230
I don't do read to me what is going to
break everything artpop

211
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,790
you know lay you out write a report
three months later they get a memo that

212
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,250
something really bad happened

213
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,310
our goal and I compromise everybody I
destroy everything

214
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,529
and I walk out of the building for two
minutes I then walked back in

215
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,170
usually with the representative the
company with me shows authority

216
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,730
and I explained to them to every person
I compromised what I did

217
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,350
why I was a bad person and why they
shouldn't have done what they did

218
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,110
and what to look for next time that
gives them the information that gives

219
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,290
them a teachable moment that gives them
something that they can use

220
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,949
to better protect themselves so this one
engage in was so horrible that we

221
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,779
actually had everybody come in

222
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,790
I way to the bank was closed Staal also
scared the guy

223
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,290

closed we

224
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,610
got everybody all the employees together
that the gentleman that was with me

225
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,000
could speak Arabic make sure it was
totally translated how badly they

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,839
screwed up

227
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,279
and ike's we need to tell them what I
was doing why these issues were

228
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,930
a half way through the bank manager

229
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,170

like

230
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,360

231
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,970
to do we still get the equipment

232
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,140
from at work and I felt like

233
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,089
a stroll from world like no I was
wondering

234
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm a horrible person it's like I

235
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,110

okay i like it so hard headed out for
you

238
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,160
so while I was there and like I said I
was there for a little bit

239
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,029
if you can actually kill the timestamp I
was there for over 22 minutes

240
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,380
I was actually twirling in the chair on
my iPad you wanna see that I could

241
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,770
actually the actual live video and 7
others like you see me twirling in the

242
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,250
chair

243
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,830
I but also owes I want to I need to show
that I could do

244
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,700
online bad things right so what I need
to do what you see that guy and a snappy

245
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,560
sweater vest

246
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,959
it's like I got as you dry D and I got
his password

247
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,209
and the use a NorCal boxes with smart
cards because they're very secure

248
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:05,500
so I had to get a smart card to so now I
have a user ID

249
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,950
i've a password and I have a smart card
so I need only two other things right

250
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,060
I need a PC any network access and I can
start wiring all the money I need to

251
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,709
wire

252
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:18,080
to where I need to go that'll be you
know

253
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,740
shouldn't be too difficult right it's
like I've got three other I got through

254
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,330
to five

255
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,270
so what do I do next go to another
branch brand new branch

256
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,800
this thing gauge min I said

257
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,430
0 I did not say a word to anybody

258
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,320
I walk straight n down the hallway

259
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,010
actually enter into the break room so
they will get a you know blue glass

260
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,029
water cuz you know

261
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,020
honing people's a parched apartment for
a so I thought I will be drinking water

262
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,560
and I waited for a couple minutes and I
walked back out

263
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,690
right into the teller area while the
guys conducting business

264
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,010
and I stole the computer

265
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,210
I'll early stole the computer from
behind the teller line

266
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,920
why they were doing business without
saying a word exact why do I dick

267
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,610
why do the Pauls why do you do appalled
when you try to go into someplace

268
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,210
this validation shows that you're there
you're stops you may talk to somebody

269
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,630
that you know what you're doing

270
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,010
you're obviously doing something you're
not just like walk around milling gotta

271
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,880
go somewhere

272
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,560
and be there for a little bit show that
they're the permits and then you come

273
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,230
back out

274
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,110
and people except so I did that without

275
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,480
saying saying a word so now I've got
user ID

276
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,520
password smart card their computer I
need one more thing I believe

277
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,730
I am so I want to the third branch you
know

278
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,490
hole in the computer like hey I'm doing
a test with the headquarters and stuff

279
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,940

network access your network all that are

280
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,090
to finish this transaction assuring
working right

281
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,370

282
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,910
I so they let me in there so there you
are

283
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,230
that's how long that's how hard it was

284
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,660
not one scrap of

285
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,160
any kind of advanced research not one
scrap

286
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,850
of I rekon done no NLP tricks

287
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,930
no only social engineering you know
microfiche repression reading

288
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,450
or free texting or anything like that I
walked and

289
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,510
try to be adorable and destroyed much as
I can basic

290
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,800
adorable destructive so

291
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,800
let's go to the next one this was
actually

292
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,310
the state treasury in United States that
won the state I can't name the state

293
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,940
casino

294
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,130
they're not very happy about it I am but
it also tells you I think about what

295
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,190
they do about scope

296
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,570
let's talk a minute for us couples like
when you're doing a pen test

297
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,130
it's like pen tester they want to do an
attack

298
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,630
like an attacker will do it right so
therefore attacker Scopus like this

299
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,870
I'm going to hack all the banks right

300
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,800
it's like I'm to go anytime i cant im a
funny kind Avenue

301
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,100
editor Clive you need %uh I we knew that
tax surfers like this

302
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,030
and the class yes a course you do

303
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,040
that would be awesome but can you do
that kind of attack between

304
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,110
you know Monday to Friday okay

305
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,750
and and we want to be able to do a quick
response again you there between nine

306
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,550
and five

307
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,220
that would be awesome okay and we don't
want you to affect the production server

308
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,750
so he could do you leave those out the
scope

309
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,210
okay I won't got this dev box on this
one IP address can you go over there and

310
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,190
try to attack us

311
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,190
that should be great very go attack us
just like an attacker what

312
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,320
here's your scope and thats

313
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,640
not the same I believe but you know this

314
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,060
this state treasury had their scope like
this this was their scope

315
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,010
and when I mean this was their scope I
mean we'd already successfully got

316
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,730
inside

317
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,550
they were very unhappy with that result
so they sent me out to prove that I

318
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,720
could actually breaking from

319
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,230
inside to validate all the different
findings that we have because they kept

320
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,680
saying

321
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,680
we would have to be inside the internal
network to do that that means that the

322
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,970
internal network to do that we already
like we are to cover the vision that we

323
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,550
were in the turn on that word lets

324
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,990
let's 3006 argument let's get Jason out
there and actually get inside physically

325
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,870
see what happens

326
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,010
so I look at their headquarters

327
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:27,710
their headquarters were nice no joke
that a man trapped lobby

328
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,390
we might get like one already give al a
day then that another door to give al de

329
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,970
interceptors right there

330
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,160
that was good a great camera placement
they have the glasses the glass should

331
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,450
be shaded but it wasn't but they did
have blinds and stuff you know they did

332
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,930
most most the marchers were

333
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,020
away from the sport from the window
which was good are something that

334
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,000
that was a pretty nice set up there was
like I mean it's like they were guarding

335
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
money cuz you know

336
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
the state treasury so that's a good
thing right I did find one

337
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,580
bomber building I found that they had a
dumbwaiter that that wasn't the active a

338
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,240
70

339
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,980
that went into the basement that with
the public access area prop for dining

340
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,720
room down there

341
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,940
it's like I could've gone in there and I
could go on to this one a

342
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,180
caged area step you know they've gone up
the dumbwaiter into the

343
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,810
inside the office bypassing the cameras
and the doors but

344
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,750
I did try that dumb waiter was dark and
doctor spiders and you know just now

345
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,040
okay so I was gonna go that route that
route was

346
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,890
dead to me 70 cuz they would let me

347
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,910
have fire that wasn't for the scope
either oslo

348
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,710
but they did have a building and office
in an office building

349
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,750
farther afield will also

350
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,490
you know what happened you know what
happened with those kinda buildings

351
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,830
you want to be connected to the internal
network rights they have created

352
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,000
external tunnel so they're directly
connected inside the internal network

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,850
so sitting in an office is just like
sitting in that headquarters

354
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,270
but that office didn't have all those
other controls

355
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,120
sounds like and you know hackers we'd
like to do things easy right

356
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,070
I'm going to have to those guys so they
said okay Jason okay chasing you can go

357
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,030
out to those guys

358
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,250
well we just have a few rules just love
the scope for you okay

359
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,990
so you're also the engagement are you
can talk to anyone coming in around the

360
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,360
building because they may not be one of
our employees

361
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,750
so you can talk to the body you can't
judge in with the door you can't use you

362
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,490
know your usual cardboard or
sledgehammers and stuff you know

363
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,840
crowbars which are usually very helpful
tools

364
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,780
we getting into a building so that was
unfortunate I'll

365
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,550
to if you do get inside the building I
have to stay in the public areas

366
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,610
I can try to get anywhere else is there
to say the public areas until I hear the

367
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,430
cleaning crew

368
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,780
identify talk to the cleaning crew
they're not an employee

369
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,230
a stager is so i cant lied to them I had
to tell them the truth

370
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,570
so can talk to anybody

371
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,470
had to stay in a public area and had to
tell the truth whoa that go ahead attack

372
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,910
us

373
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,800
we're ready let's see what happens well
let's

374
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,000
let's see how that works out for them
but urban get my nose of their

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,460
area ok here we are

376
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,080
in was always go here to come go to the
side door first you go

377
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,080
because maybe it opens you

378
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,020
it is not and once again a crowbar was
not in the list of things I could use

379
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:31,020
which sort of ruins that part so
disappointed I start walking over to the

380
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,970
other side

381
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:37,380
which I do tell you in the minutes and
25 seconds that this video is going to

382
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,000
last

383
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,870
I is the longest part other video is
walking

384
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,400
but has been a good time to

385
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,760
help trickle the diet pepsi up

386
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,460
noticed carefully when I get to the door

387
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,020
which will be in just a second I promise

388
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,870
I try it it's locked

389
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:07,300
I didn't step

390
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,110
off to the

391
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,799
i'd pull out my magical hacking device a
phone

392
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:18,190
SR playing Angry Birds or something like
that make like I'm doing something

393
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,059
and then about what a seconds later I
believe

394
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:29,059
I didn't

395
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,110
say a word I broke into a telecom
station telecom company in Beirut

396
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,650
Lebanon

397
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,150
compromising every single one other
floors in their high-rise building

398
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,330
that had secured toward access more
discussed I got up

399
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,440
into the Fortune bypassed lobby will do
that later

400
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,350
but it's like we're I got in there and
each floor

401
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,549
at ease when the secure doors what I do
I had a phone out

402
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,600
and this guy freakin is

403
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,890
is my friends phone giving head like any
good games eyes I just like to look at a

404
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,409
blank

405
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,630
does the screen have turned on like
swipe swipe card

406
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,360
there's wifi cunard is doing nothing but
as soon as someone hit

407
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,059
entered for someone left up

408
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:20,070
walk tried it iPhone it's like I was
busy so talk obviously oblong there

409
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,669
could I was concerned about anything

410
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:24,960
so now I'm inside so now

411
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,669
I'm here for two hours two hours I mean
this facility

412
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,820
Utah not understand how bad my ADD years

413
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,730
and how horrible those two hours worked
okay can i unlock

414
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,860
in a lobby doing nothing my battery was
like down 22 percent

415
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,640
Angry Birds don't cover for two hours
people it just doesn't work that way

416
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,120
so I'm there waiting for two hours to
hear something

417
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,549

I go upstairs

419
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,780
or would be a good Jason video without
my nose

420
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,100
let's go in there up stairs

421
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,350
number

422
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,720
disorder stop a repeat what they say you
have that microphone down here

423
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,450
word

424
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,620

say hello I told her I was trying to get
back into the sweet

427
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,400
which is true I was there the day before

428
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,620
and now I'm trying to get back in that
is the truth

429
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,549
or actors let me in real quick

430
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:56,740
your just clean that one

431
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,130
I

432
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,380
basically let me n I could get in which
was true that would let me at the

433
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,060
crowbar remembers I couldn't get in

434
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,970
I just went to the bathroom

435
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,370
I was there for two hours people during
a lot of water okay

436
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,600
and I don't have my badge I have an
actual authorized employee badge for my

437
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,910
Mike day job I did not have that bad
with me

438
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:30,910
truth again I didn't say it was their
badge

439
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,410
I had

440
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:53,410
the one thing real quick this for their
network once again honest

441
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:05,539
so

442
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,150
working to

443
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,660
late I was on the job you know to do
that it's like I think that

444
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,120
corneil after I have is endearing to
people that's why I still use it

445
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,600
that's what I myself anyway by here

446
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,370
his party this video walking to the door

447
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:29,370
that it opened I don't have the key to
getting

448
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:43,160
so I now

449
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,170
all the employees that's in this car
waiting for me to fail

happens I

452
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,690
ep there was no one there you still have
the phone

453
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,830
in your hand used to act like you're
talking to someone because when they

454
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,750
come back

455
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,080
what do you say you say oh yeah that
what they got you don't worry about it

456
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,990
they got the key now

457
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,170
its cool you not to come and national
verification

458
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,090
date starting away he would've gotten in
any way he didn't really need be I'm

459
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,880
just helping out to the wood are done it

460
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,880
and that gives them that verification do
that method

461
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,980
that's what I say just a second the app

462
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,429
she got

463
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:45,429
I'm good thanks and and that

464
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:51,309
issue so

465
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,940
the scope when you talk to

466
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,289
a client stuff you know you tell them to
you couldn't give us as many things you

467
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,039
want it is.

468
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:02,429
you around are things doesn't mean we're
always gonna get it but the attackers

469
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:04,049
don't have those restrictions

470
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,980
and you're not getting attacked by
people that are on your network

471
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,139
you're getting attacked by people that
are attacking your network so

472
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:17,200
the the next part years I am

473
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,840
I don't do this I don't policy don't do
these jobs and stuff you know because

474
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,870
they're profitable

475
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,370
I usually don't cuz I think the font
it's like i I go to we're pleased I did

476
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:25,889
not

477
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:29,919
I've never broken into a facility in
Boise Idaho

478
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,549
a site no no disrespect to Boise I'm
sure it sounds good now like saying

479
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,399
Boise lot

480
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,620
but it's just not want those places on
my bucket list going

481
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,740
suck you know I like going in attacking
places when you say

482
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,649
well Jason there's this research
facility stuff you know with dangerous

483
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:44,120
chemicals

484
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,970
okay let's try that one you know it's
like or are there is a hotel in the

485
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,730
South of France

486
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,190
second there was a tester security on
their so we will go for those things

487
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,820
this is one of those cases I gotta I'd I
a job out to go into our financial

488
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,909
situation in Jamaica

489
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:03,370
and i actually give a discount because
they said they'd give me tell these two

490
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,870
days a Turing to make us from

491
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,090
Cup I'm there right up and

492
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,000
it was a it was a pretty good engagement
it was a financial institution it's like

493
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,970
a in Kingston

494
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,820
and they were from they were happy with
what was going on they

495
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,389
the them the really bad breaking sup
what they wanted to they were a little

496
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:23,419
upset at the fact that

497
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:27,620
I gatien and so they want to see how
difficult they can make it so they're

498
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,179
like would you come downtown

499
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:32,759
and coming get our are facility downtown
Mike well

500
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,320
okay up but this led to

501
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,710
what I call the Jason the terrible
horrible no good very bad social

502
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,370
engineering

503
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,480
gauge mint I have done some really low
down thanks

504
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,379
okay I have no problem coming into your
facility in a wheelchair with the box

505
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,419
I my lap and stuff you know what have
you open the door

506
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,120
no problem whatsoever you know what it's
like people look at that got to chase

507
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,289
that is horrible

508
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:02,149
excuse me the guy who's got the gun and
robbing you doesn't go

509
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:05,429
really sorry about this and stuff you
know but need all your money you know

510
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,230
they don't

511
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,980
I do apologize like that Western Canada
maybe you know it I don't know about

512
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,580
that but

513
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,400
probably there other than that they're
bad guys doing bad things

514
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,870
you're trying to steal from you so they
don't feel bad that they found a

515
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,990
successful way there's this really sucky
that works

516
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,340
because it makes them money so i win an

517
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,150
after doing an hour 45 minutes research
and found out that my target had a

518
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,559
charity organization

519
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,010
and it was in scope because they were on
the same network

520
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,630
time by the email address and and
headers and stuff and I was like

521
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,110
0 charity organization way

522
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,410
easier then a financial institution to
break into the right

523
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,730
and once again it's still on the same
network are so the pretext was

524
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,940
I was a visiting TV producer from
america that was going to put them on TV

525
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,549
make them famous because they're great
charity a charity in organizational

526
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:05,100
works they do in Jamaica cuz they were
like great people they did

527
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,940
off from work in the communities in
Jamaica and the poor areas are they were

528
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,490
awesome

529
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,059
these people were great so I called him
up

530
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:16,150
you know if they had the at the guy does
work with locally called him up he said

531
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,990
like up

532
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,380
yeah take were always he's here he's
visiting seven israeli prime on the fun

533
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,130
fact: yeah I was drawn on gadget I was
having dinner with a friend what we're

534
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,330

535
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:28,590
like

536
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,160
this is perfect for my show cause we're
doing is we're talking about

537
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,890
corporations that do public good

538
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,110
they don't get another advertise it
doesn't get enough exposure about all

539
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,169
the things that happen

540
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,160
from the organization from the corporate
side that bring good terrible works to

541
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,960

598
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,480
into your computer a quick and show you
want the videos you actually see it

599
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,310
and it's like Sosa yeah that sounds good
so I plug the USB Drive in

600
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,000
and it pops up and then I was like it is
other air message to North actually

601
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,260
technical error messages

602
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,540
I honestly think the power on his
computer was actually combating with the

603
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,740
power that was on mine

604
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,300
and they were like having a fight or
something was really weird so it's like

605
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,070
some like at a loss it up when I'm like
actually liked

606
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,510
well that's never happened before that
the event has acted like that's unusual

607
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,850
and this guy really wanted to see this
video

608
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,100
still he contacts is tech support which
is third party now to scope

609
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,549
and I'm like wanna know that's okay
that's okay

610
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,780
our email you could be's like know all
should senator

611
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,230
key hence my USB Drive to this guy I
made a very important

612
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,250
he handed it to him not me that my bad
okay he gave it to all

613
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,480
not me and I'm like thanking quicker
might be here stuff you know coming says

614
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,119
internet with the biggest thing to do

615
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,450
it be able to do stuff as to preclude
you never know when it's just gonna go

616
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,730
hit the fan it's on like up you know
there's other videos on that USB Drive

617
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,920
that you can see their proprietary so
it's like I gotta go with him to make

618
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,030
sure I know what video he's looking at

619
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,880
I suppose to write one he does look at
the other folders I

620
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,430
and basically I needed to go and find
out what computer reported on site

621
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,710
approved a report that that machine was
compromised

622
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,300
so we go in and we go to his old I
desktops in areas that you know

623
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,510
depositors computer is a Linux computer

624
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,230
I like croquet I program the coach that
you know for

625
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:09,530
to run on Windows okay that's right I
realize how awesome ubuntu is with wine

626
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,609
kids like cuz the code ran I'm like

627
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:17,010
well that was also an expected so I get
the full you must not domain admin creds

628
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,619
on their network in every other network
he supports

629
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,230
sup sorta good that was awesome right

630
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,500
but then the bad part happened I've
compromise

631
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,360
both machines

632
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,820
it's like I've got domain admin creds
Jamie

633
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,890
I have to go back into that office

634
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,520
and talk to those wonderful people

635
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,720
does awesome humanitarian its

636
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,590
the lady gave me a copy of her book you
like the mother teresa

637
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,860
to make up I still have it on my shelf
waco bad like a 0

638
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:56,350
you know it's like and I had this talk
for the next 15 to 20 minutes

639
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,720
about how they were going to be on
television

640
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,380
and how the what 1/4 I actually started
buying into it I was like

641
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,200
you're gonna do we're gonna have this a
female employee what's gonna have is

642
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,220
that we see her working have heard ask

643
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,370
on the computer and the road transition
gonna pan out to the rest the call

644
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,050
center

645
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,140
and do we get to the glass window and
that's gonna fade

646
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,940
the US history to Jamaica and then
you're gonna see this one street this

647
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,130
desolate streets have no

648
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,620
and there's that same lady kneeling down
helping to feed a child

649
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,580
and you're gonna show how your
corporation goes from the call center

650
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,980
down and then passed directly to the
streets Jamaica it could be I mean I

651
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,190
would give in to that likes to make
actually a pretty good TV show you know

652
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,280
sound like an idiot I was all good and
then

653
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,170
I leave I walk out of the building and I
wait two minutes

654
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,920
now 83 minutes

655
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,680
about 45 minutes by driver comes over
cuz he knows my process you know it's

656
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,880
like I go I wait two minutes ago back
yet

657
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,200
about 45 minutes he drives up to me like

658
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,720
adjacent are you going back inside them
like I can't tell those people what I

659
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,330
just

660
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:13,200
trip I it's a really crappy pics I can't
tell them what active period

661
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,640
for the first time in my life I actually
had a call the client up

662
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,670
and column times that work you have to
tell a wonderful people what does happen

663
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,450
till because

664
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm not going back in can't make me I
head back to the headquarters

665
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:29,370
stock you later kids like in so I
thought really bad about that one

666
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,380
it's like so

667
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,520
that was the result I really did feel
bad about him usually when I

668
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,880
at success leap on somebody said you
know i i reward myself with ice cream

669
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,880
but I did have ice cream on that one but
it s lil better

670
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,970
so it's like a I didn't enjoy as much as
I usually do

671
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,120
up but it was still outlandish

672
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,070
unbelievable and it worked it's like
these are not

673
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,890
advanced attacks these are not something
that's like you know

674
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,840
it's just someone walking in and you a
lot of people ask themselves

675
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,270
why does it work why did these attacks
work

676
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:07,490
what did they all have in common we want
to believe

677
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:12,820
human nature wants to believe it's like
I don't you know this was like a really

678
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,440
great conference and stuff you know

679
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,520
I when we all finished as copper drawing
ago bout time to get on a plane and I i

680
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,130
its I cuz you're probably a plane crash
you know halfway my house right

681
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,480
that's a pleasant thought is in the
realm of raising yes

682
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,380
do we wanna think about that part of it
that probability

683
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,580
no people don't want to believe
something bad can happen or will happen

684
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,320
to them

685
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,150
if I can give you a reasonable lie

686
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,930
that is better than the unpleasant truth
that is occurring

687
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,990
you will believe the lie otherwise
you'll have to believe that there's a

688
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,650
guy

689
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,040
with this USB Drive who's trying to
steal data from you who's trying to

690
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,980
compromise you

691
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,840
and is trying to take all your secrets
that's not fun

692
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,000
that's not nice but if there's a nice
helpful smiling technician guy who wants

693
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,210
a plugin the USB device

694
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,780
to make sure your securing safe and
everything's all going like you happy

695
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,730
well that's totally cool I'll early I
was doing a documented for buy stock com

696
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,460
in London

697
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,460
about three months ago to three months
ago and they were like

698
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,890
try to break in our headquarters and I'm
like okay

699
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:25,550
so I literally just walk in with my use
rubber ducky that I had someone might my

700
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,200
gear on

701
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,470
side have invested in with me and I had
a

702
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,230
I fake ID badge I look fake ID badges
right so I had one is that Microsoft

703
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,760
have my name said hacker on it okay

704
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,050
it was on a lanyard that said
professionally evil

705
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,620
part thank you Kevin Johnson and I walk
in

706
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,410
it is a predominantly a Mac shop Apple's
everywhere right

707
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,490
and I got children like and will they
actually stopped the first pickups like

708
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,500
your passion as Microsoft on it

709
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,550
how much you have a good guide to make
control are trying to the USB Rights

710
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,150
Commission the GPO policies are
affecting

711
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,330
all the different she's even though it's
Apple the sauna network based network

712
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,460
and so therefore we will have a

713
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,220
cheesy peery second 70 when it comes to
the authorization USB drives because

714
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,160
it's better that way

715
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,540
okay edit

716
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,580
got an issue like but that says hacker
on it

717
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,120
oh yeah because you know you did good
hackers to go after the Packers I'm when

718
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,030
the good hackers up with that hackers
that's why Microsoft hard reset exact

719
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,670
okay plugin gopac's applauded

720
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,370
all for Windows disappear I call you out
this was to do that let me let me just

721
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,170
like this way

722
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,680
they all come back see I had it them our
on the program or the the

723
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,140
it's not really about where it's like i
don't do like a Saudi red teaming IT

724
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,830
security whereas

725
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,830
so I try I make it a game so on a Mac

726
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,200
all the windows disappearing got XY
while there is a windows when white

727
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,330
and PsycINFO but he plugged into a
Windows machine

728
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,660
it brings up YouTube Weird Al Yankovich
white nerdy

729
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,780
and I had to explain why white nerdy
just popped up on the screen

730
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,850
so it's like and I got to one account
machines that was a windows-based

731
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,060
sheen like Mary popped up for but

732
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,960
I don't know that that's just a test to
make sure you got internet-connected

733
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,020
make sure that actually was able to get
out to the Internet net that the Cubs

734
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,510
working properly so yep that works out
great thank you very much

735
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,180
okay that and a record all this that the
guy that was like

736
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,290
when it was done the looks on people's
faces when I realized what just occurred

737
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,360
they were not happy that site by try to
talk to respond to what happened why we

738
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,210
didn't step you know

739
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,620
but was that believable

740
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,559
no it's like

741
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:39,709
the martyrs of guy coming in now the
blue at night actually to go into all

742
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:40,509
the sax

743
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:44,709
but they didn't have anything the judge
it on so

744
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:49,839
whose fault is that you stupid user

information security policy that took in
the human factor

750
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:13,249
and didn't prepare for the human factor

751
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:18,759
casual were failing obviously we've come
to the baseball park so far

752
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:22,420
talk it's like because all the things
that we need to start doing

753
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,069
we need to educate empower enforce

754
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:29,380
up for users and what does that mean

755
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,729
ruston up with educate we need to start

756
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:36,689
educating our users on what they need to
do to better protect themselves

757
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:41,279
it I because users when they know what a
threat yes

758
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:45,619

shotgun

760
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:52,630
I was gonna have a probably a pretty bad
day it I because my intentions would've

761
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,029
been a bit more clear what I was trying
to do

762
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:58,079
and true employees have been trying for
that

763
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,630
we train our employees to be prepared
for these guys

764
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,069
well maybe not those get guys because
they're adorable but it's like food

765
00:44:05,069 --> 00:44:08,259
prepared when they were there using
those things were afraid those thanks

766
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:11,660
those are bad things right those are
scary thing see no

767
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,949
big to give you always not good so

768
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:18,479
we protected us but we don't protect
people against this

769
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:22,670
we don't really wanna be where these
guys day the guys gonna be afraid a

770
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,689
special that one guy with the pineapple
he little sketchy sorry there

771
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:30,819
but I gotta watch out for those guys
right the other guys

772
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,390
go into a branch they walk out with a
couple thousand dollars

773
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,219
at they walkout at all I may be a bore
hole or two

774
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,150
these guys walk into a branch they walk
out with millions

775
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,520
you know if they do

776
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,580
a call to get you know to the nice cushy
you know white collar crime

777
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,460
jails that you know we're where we want
to go anywhere right if you commit a

778
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:50,880
crime

779
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,380
that's what happens there we're not
training our employees

780
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,670
on what to be afraid of we're not
teaching them to be aware

781
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:02,620
are the dangers that these things happen
these are terrifying

782
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,820
in a workplace environment it's like
these things or

783
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,490
and you know what people talk about like
all I just get some our USB Drive not

784
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,530
the home in the parking lot or I put him
in the bathroom where in the lobby floor

785
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:14,130
Surya

786
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,520
that is wasteful it I I walk into an
engagement

787
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,940
I have blank envelopes so I walked
through the environment

788
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,760
I see someone's desk with no one's there
I see their name badge

789
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,340
are their name plate their surname put
the USB Drive and

790
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,370
folded put it on their desk they come
back to their task

791
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,970
they seem m below put their name on it
they see a USB Drive

792
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,880
who's not plugging it in please raise
your hand okay

793
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,120
probably like but OK bust-up

794
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,060
you go there you do open the YouTube a
plugin the USB Drive

795
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,430
if you have the power to on Stanley
rhyme it's like there's an excel file

796
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:00,980
projects and projections as deputy for
pay raises for 2016

797
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,620
no one's gonna click on that right

798
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,350
no one's gonna click on something like
that especially if you're in accounting

799
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,940
specially for an HR specially if you're
just like in general I T

800
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,290
a person you're not gonna click on map
so that's why do with USB drives

801
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:21,180
I also go to conferences I love
conferences because conferences love to

802
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,410
give out USB drives

803
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,700
it's like white paper a malware up

804
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,920
launcher when you've got you know
conference to go that gives them to you

805
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,640
I am there was a our conference and
Australia

806
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,310
where energy conference where the guy
actually went to

807
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,630
want to the booze developers grab a
handful love the

808
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,070
USB drives went up stairs to his hotel
room

809
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,280
weaponized on I just a weaponized cuz
you know cyberwar

810
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,640
so psyche weaponize issue your USB Drive
you know

811
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,460
goes back down drops as payload into the
ball i'm talking USB Drive here stop

812
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,630
thats bad person there that sounds like
he drops the the payload into the ball

813
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,750
and he walks away compromising half the
conference right

814
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,710
it's like that's how easy it is

815
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,730
and that is a known fact that occur it's
like a

816
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,860
I love doing is a corrupt I did this a
talking to Johannesburg I

817
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,970
a couple weeks ago and this was the get
that they gave me so I thought that was

818
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:17,450
fun

819
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:21,380
so like I said like this doesn't have an
hour on it yet but a

820
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,410
actually does now that but it didn't
when I was doing the talk there

821
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,350
it's like I should update dislike so %uh
so that this does have power on it now

822
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,760
it's a nice p.m. and saw the laser
pointer so that Corp

823
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,390
I am so we have to be worried about the
sex so

824
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,960
we need to train our employees not to
look for just the specific

825
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,330
this is what things are going to look
like we can't just say

826
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,510
lookout for this this is bad this is
actually a poster someone actually made

827
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,410
including their security operations
center

828
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,850
to warn them against people there come
in and that are sketchy

829
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:57,120
you know which is that is a valid target
has a ballot sketchy person to be aware

830
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,550
of

831
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,380
okay unfortunately that only teaching
them to be aware

832
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,960
one specific person not all the other
people that could come in

833
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,580
and attacked them it's like you can't
make it that narrow your focus you have

834
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,320
to make sure

835
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,060
they understand the behaviors not the
people doing behaviors

836
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,460
because I don't have to come in your
company's computer guy shirt

837
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,130
I can come in with a lot of other
different things thanks to this advanced

838
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:24,010
our social engineering a facilitator
called me back

839
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:29,640
or I can just go to Derby Conn pick up
some %ah badges from Sky doggone

840
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,700
you know that that's really nice of him
the

841
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,730
top one where says Gregory Evans some
given the troll face and actually says

842
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,690
I'm from Group E Ink was a successful
bad as I used at a client site that made

843
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,020
from their client machine

844
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,860
and yes I am putting on the troll face
and I still got in

845
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,440
so you gotta beware what kinda

846
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,570
a tools attacker could use but most
importantly

847
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:57,200
we need to teach employees a common
dangers that face not only at work

848
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,800
I ever great revelation free this is
gonna knock your socks off

849
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,900
okay

850
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,880
you this is good mind blown moment here
employees

851
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,590
don't care about your data they don't

852
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:13,330
I'm calm down employees

853
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,450
donen Claire what their employers day
this have

854
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:19,570
what they do for a living they just care
about their job

855
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,310
they are still getting pound by phishing
scams

856
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:27,180
at home they're still getting taken by
Craig listing eBay scams

857
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,390
at home they still don't know what their
children are doing

858
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,700
on the Internet on Facebook or anything
like that at home

859
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,970
they still don't have a proper to
encrypt wifi access point at home

860
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,380
why would you think that they would be
better protecting your data

861
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,650
at work stop trying to teach

862
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,720
your employees how to protect your data

863
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,020
you will fail start teaching your
employees

864
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,700
how to protect themselves teacher
employees

865
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,110
give a1 our lesson on how the secured
properly secure

866
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,790
your home WiFi access points give them

867
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:12,870
and our educational out lesson on how to
be aware of scams

868
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:17,040
that affect them at home give them a
one-hour lesson

869
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,820
on how to lock down social media and
facebook profiles

870
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,680
for their children themselves at home
and guess what's going to happen

871
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,640
they're still not going to care about
your data

872
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,210
but they're gonna be more security
conscious for themselves

873
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,400
so when they see something like that
happen to them at work

874
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,960
they're going to be able to go and say
yeah that looks pretty sketchy I learned

875
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,270
that

876
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:48,390
not to do that at home I gotta reported
here and I'll start protecting your data

877
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,370
but you gotta drive home the fact the
stranger danger the good policy no

878
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,170
matter where or how old you are

879
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,310
I love secured facility organizations I
love those barriers those places there's

880
00:50:59,310 --> 00:50:59,660
like

881
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,430
lockdown heavy promoter I love those
places

882
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,470
Bob wire fences gone over

883
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:10,760
and stepping outside walls like I with
the Miami jumping off a four-foot gap

884
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,130
answer from a parking garage door
third-floor window

885
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,850
just to show them that they should lock
the

886
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:20,000
Windows I love those places you know why
because once you're behind that

887
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,040
perimeter

888
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,510
what else is there the only thing worse
did no security is a false sense of

889
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,330
security

890
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:33,790
I go to those facilities and every
person looks at me like willie Mae to

891
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,940
securities got the OK

892
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,350
they got their teeth out on their desk
they got their car keys they've got

893
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:39,680
their

server room the assistant RTC me

901
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:10,330

door glass window thing I see the dorsey

902
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,530
is open and there's nobody inside the
office I think knows the deposit I'm not

903
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:18,070
like so I just want your plight I'm here
to check on that lot of make sure

904
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,230
there's a security setting up because
we're trying to test

905
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,540
some from the RAM chips and stuff you
know the nation's calls it a conflict of

906
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,370
interest from the

907
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:29,040
the IP stack okay I don't ever

908
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,040
ever tried to sound like I know what I'm
talking about

909
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,840
okay it's like I do talk that gibberish
so

910
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,840
I walk n and he had a laptop lock cable

911
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,980
away whether the test laptop

912
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:47,010
tried close the laptop and I walk out
with it the worst part of that whole

913
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,020
scenario

914
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,760
is walking outside opening up the laptop

915
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,280
and realizing that the screen came back
on

916
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,610
was not locked and I had the open window
ball as data

917
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,840
guys call back

918
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:08,070
okay and not my kinda bad that's just
seriously that's pretty core

919
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:12,050
so that happens the all set to create
teachable bent

920
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,090
year-round on act and to exercise
utility

921
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:19,840
their body have your web content
questionnaire form the talking explain

922
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,110
to people the dangers up

923
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:24,790
I information security and hacking and
and bad things that happen till noon

924
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,180
net I mean other very hard he knows
multiple choice questions that if you

925
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,120
fail you can go I got that one wrong to
be

926
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,560
backspace okay barrio checked it it

927
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,700
secured that works out well for
everybody right

928
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,550
I'm sure Sony had were those plans to
enter and their internet suddenly on

929
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,960
like a great that happened are not right
at the cops on at the center for border

930
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,760
security

931
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,930
I hope so public this is the court my
bad

932
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,740
are so that says that that's just the
truth

933
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:59,560
start I am so what else do we need to do
we need to empower the employees

934
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,080
cuz in the Nuvi you're the only person
that but you need to give them

935
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,930
the education show them what they can do
to protect themselves show them what

936
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,490
they can do to protect your area

937
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,080
but they give film the wheel and up

938
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,630
empowerment actually do that there are
some things you can do

939
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,320
users are not from their party solution
their party ideas to make

940
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,450
anybody notices something that's going
to be going wrong or something that is

941
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:26,120
odd

942
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,740
is the person that is doing the same job
over and over and over and over again

943
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,380
every day the week

944
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,290
they're the first person that's going to
notice something ought to current

945
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:41,450
but do they know who to call not
Ghostbusters I miss there's a good they

946
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,480
know who to call

947
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,430
do that do you have an extension if
you're in it organization or the company

948
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:50,810
do you have one extension that people
can call for any security-related issues

949
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:55,480
physical or network correct based I was
in Amman Jordan

950
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,550

looking are you're right

953
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,150
I said to be but good hockey I should be
doing that it's like you should call

954
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:09,850

955
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:13,900
give a number to call the call up stairs

should be doing should be pointed these

958
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,210
devices in without authorization I
thought you had the authorization

959
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,680
it's like you should talk up yes a
project this is somebody should

960
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,240
call someone you should meet us talking
to me right now I mean you go talk to

961
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,260
but I should be good

962
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,330
what that I should be doing this this is
not cool

963
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,310
it's like you to contact someone let the

964
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,970
know they'll tell you I should be here
all thank you

965
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:43,770
5 by the way 5 received i infected
before

966
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,740
she finally got upset cuz I was behind
the teller line in there was a snack

967
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,350
money

968
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:52,100
right by the computer and DUP it didn't
freak her out other or the computer is

969
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,030
just the second one was there after a
terrified look

970
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,470
I'm not worried about the money I just
look like this in real quick and that

971
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,180
was a no go

972
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,440
so I just you know got walkout so I can
get my letter time it was okay

973
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,200
no one that was reported to anybody
measure it was reported

974
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,660
security was notified no that whole
incident was not report any body

975
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,720
thats might be something that your
security would want to be known about

976
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,220
they would like probably to know that
someone walking up the street started

977
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,120
playing a USB Drive into the terminals

978
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,160
so give them opportunities to do the
right thing and reward them when they

979
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,510
succeed anti some when they fail so
create those moments bike going and crew

980
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,020
I am

981
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,070
trying to walk it this is not having up
higher up in testing people

982
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,760
just try to pay back behind someone
stepping up behind the door and see if

983
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,540
they stop you

984
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:46,370
send an email that single suspicious and
stepping over see if they actually click

985
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,240
on it are they actually reply back to it

986
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,120
it's like do things there that actually
let them know

987
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,570
that they can be better and when they do
the right thing

988
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,270
make sure you notify you put in a
newsletter you put to their supervisor

989
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:04,080
you for your supervisor at the hey stop
with a very good job the Starbucks card

990
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,690
thing doesn't always works always carry
Starbucks card so when people you know

991
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,980
stop me in the questioning what
congratulations are due to security or

992
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,020
anything you want here's the Starbucks
Card II just to get back at thanks

993
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,410
that works you source at

994
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,420
as or to me but you know the got a fair
fight they gotta verify they gotta have

995
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,700
a number that they should be calling

996
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,710
and that's how the person went by
actually calling the number and

997
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,540
verifying

998
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,470
what was going on up so the last part

999
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,840
is the fun part I like this one the best
because it's one thing to note here now

1000
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,750
could also I bash so much on information
security guys

1001
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,999
I get the bash on employers

1002
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:45,400
upper management you know that whole
thing

1003
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,220
this is a so too tired cliche you have
to have a prevention buy into the

1004
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,990
security process for it to work

1005
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:58,069
what does that mean yet have upper
management buy into the security process

1006
00:57:58,069 --> 00:58:02,559
your

1007
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,569
name basically

1008
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:09,349
it basically what it means is you may
own the company that doesn't mean you

1009
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:10,789
have domain admin rights

1010
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:14,999
how many CEOs have domain admin rights
because you know

1011
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:19,329
ironic I should have access to it how
many

1012
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,559
those people have those kinda right have
the you know bashed allows a minute the

1013
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:24,759
time of the day or night

1014
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:29,170
you know they've never done that you
know who the biggest

1015
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,640
target I target when I'm going after I
company

1016
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,839
the CRC oppose assistant

1017
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:41,890
you know why because the conc oppose
assisted

1018
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,499
has a file ninety-nine percent of the
time

1019
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:49,170
they have a file it's either in your
email or it's on the notepad

1020
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:54,430
but text file on their desktop that file
consisted their bosses

1021
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,150
name full name data birth

1022
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:02,130
social security number are national
identity number

1023
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,319
I'll the phone numbers that they have

1024
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:08,609
their credit card numbers with the back
code on the other side

1025
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:11,680
and their passport number why is that

1026
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,329
because they're the ones that are doing
all the booking for them for travel I

1027
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:17,170
was actually giving his talk in the

1028
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:20,039
are not to start but no talk in the
Dominican Republic and I was talking to

1029
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:21,549
them it was a shipping conference

1030
00:59:21,549 --> 00:59:24,630
and all the sudden there was a
disturbance I kid you not

1031
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,089
four rows into the an audience and it
was that %uh CEO

1032
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:32,799
actually turning this way and screaming
it is assisted

1033
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,339
asking if she had that file and she was
like

1034
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,140
yeah I got that file okay he's like the
lake that's what I don't now you know

1035
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,549
you like creating a stir in like abt
didn't agree buddy trouble

1036
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:47,079
I am there was also a up a good example
though

1037
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:51,950
ice to work for a a online bank back in
2000 up for the dot-com boom

1038
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,480
a our bus

1039
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,140
so it's like us I was worried because
online bank and the owner

1040
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,460
the guy who own the bank was the CEO the
company as well he had an office there

1041
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,320
and I had a policy that I would do
walk-throughs checking to make sure you

1042
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,510
had your employee badge

1043
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:12,300
because you had to get into the second
floor area was were all the technical

1044
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,960
gear was were all the servers were

1045
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,170
while the money was that was our virtual
vault so we

1046
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:21,550
you have to make sure that you had in a
viable batch if you didn't have a viable

1047
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:23,160
badge and your employees

1048
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,250
you had to wear a pretty stupid
visitor's badge

1049
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,910
that was played out through the rest the
day so the next day told me reading you

1050
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,750
know that was void so

1051
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,810
I get aware that bash the whole day
troika badges sectioning

1052
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:41,300
I walk by the CEO's office I walk by and
I was like

1053
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,080
do you have your baggage

1054
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:50,440
I don't see your employee badge now

1055
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,430
all walk either reception she got your
badge

1056
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:58,240
what do you do in farming

1057
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,910
he went down a receptionist and he got a
visitor's badge

1058
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:06,450
he wore that batch the whole day

1059
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:12,080
what did that say that said it I believe
in them fully

1060
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,640
the security policies this company you
better believe it

1061
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,080
because as soon as upper management as
soon as the CEO says

1062
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,410
this is an exception that I get to take
because I who I am

1063
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:25,470
than the people that report to them are
going to say

1064
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,050
that's a policy I can to an exception to
because I report to the on

1065
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,630
and those people are going to say I can
make an exception because I reports that

1066
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,030
person report to that person

1067
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:39,690
and yes you have no security policy
those policies are to be enforced by

1068
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:43,210
everybody not just because your doubly
so

1069
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:46,860
if your management doubly so if you had
better right

1070
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,980
in that my day job a financial
institution

1071
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,430
I have zero domain admin rights I have
no

1072
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:58,200
rights to the actual our server rooms
server rooms it takes to

1073
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,130
I employee badges to employees to go
into one server room

1074
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:06,589
when I'm there it takes three because I
have zero rights to it

1075
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:10,019
come on the biggest threats to the
company it's like because of my

1076
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,479
knowledge my skills up you know

1077
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:15,650
even though I think leaders there's no
problem but because it based on skill

1078
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,199
set

1079
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:21,269
I've made sure that I'm out that process
that's how you explain it to your CEO's

1080
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:24,869
your CL post because it there prior in
there and there there things

1081
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:28,749
because their power and there's in there
your status you know

1082
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:32,390
also comes great responsibility no suit
so you know there's were about wearing

1083
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,619
spandex was still

1084
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,699
they have to have that responsibility
they've got that power

1085
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:40,839
I'm glad someone got the Spiderman
reference thank you so

1086
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:44,380
another years you have to show work
real-world impact

1087
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:49,279
when I screw up online how do I know the
real world that something really

1088
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:49,959
happened

1089
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:53,469
I love playing first-person shooters

1090
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,509

1093
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:03,319

01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:17,170
if you put electro shocks on male
electrode thing East

1098

group you know my on

1103
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,650
line behavior will change because there
is a Connecticut real-world consequences

1104
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,499
to it

1105
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:44,739
that I got to teach employees how do you
do that

1106
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:49,249
if someone actually install the by
Richard go sit somewhere they're not

1107
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:51,209
supposed to go to you couldn't work from
that

1108
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:55,369
invest in the time in having someone go
to their desk

1109
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:59,390
we have a small facility so sad when
someone does that

1110
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:04,749
I show up and I'm not that adorable when
I show up on that that that assignment

1111
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:07,859
excuse me can you go to charity looking
computer real quick

1112

thank you sit down you down there

1113
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:14,929
where they at you're standing right
behind to try and look everywhere but

1114
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:15,860
you know

1115
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:22,400
the people are looking at the
unlikelihood computer of hope

1116
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,200
got too many white once in awhile you
know let them know their trouble

1117
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,670
to you that walkway six you know the
employee policy

1118
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,170
you know I talked about you know not
using execute was executing or

1119
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,920
transferring to the internal network
system

1120
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,640
you wear that K well this was one the
infractions you're not what we doing

1121
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,140
that it's like i'm greta

1122
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,810
commercial visor I think I have a good
day walked out

1123
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,390
sometimes if it's like I actually got
something really bad on it I take the

1124
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,140
computer with me

1125
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,250
what did I just do I did just educate
admin ploy

1126
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,160
I educated all those employed around
them

1127
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,650
that we're watching you know I'm not
watching at the same time

1128
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:04,080
all those employees going of a good

1129
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,280
not bob man he really screwed up it's
like they're going to be telling all

1130
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,620
their friends around the water cooler by
like oh my gosh Bob got into so much

1131
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,800
trouble stuff you know

1132
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,390
it's like in there in a post on Facebook
know bob really bad at this time

1133
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:20,020
you know that creates that security
whereas that shows them

1134
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:24,360
that there's a real world Connecticut
response to what they do online

1135
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:29,950
that shows you how that behavior goes so
sometimes visibility is all it says are

1136
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,110
just being able to show

1137
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:34,210
how many people in your company know
that you exist

1138
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:38,510
how many people know that there's an
information security department

1139
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:42,290
effect using the only time people know
there's an information security

1140
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,070
department is when the chief rival up
the

1141
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:49,100
that department going far because I'm a
massive breach Sony so that's how to use

1142
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,110
easy a curse

1143
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:53,910
it's like you've got to do more about
being visible

1144
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:56,910
letting people know that you're out
there and that you're trying to protect

1145
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,880
them and they need to help them be part
of that

1146
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,220
if your CEO to the mailroom don't
understand

1147
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:06,150
that their part the security process
then you need to make sure they do

1148
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,110
understand it

1149
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:12,079
because they are

1150
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,779
so the moral my story

1151
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:18,930
is I hey the TV show breaking bad.

1152
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:23,630
I hate it I mean

1153
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:27,539

shows like was this guide I already

1154
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:28,400
spoiler alert

1155
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,519
it's like you know I hated the show why
do we

1156
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:36,369
why are we so happy watching the bag i

yourself stepping out for your company

1160

screw him smiling

1161
01:06:55,969 --> 01:07:00,839
hope he dies the calculations at work
it's like this be the bad person

1162
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:04,239
any should feel bad though his fictional

1163
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:09,109

part where greater

what I'm finished with this engagement

1202
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,380
that your security was so pissed

1203
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:42,040
poor even I got it nurse

1204
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,299
purity was so bad I was able to break in

1205
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:48,510
if your security is so bad

1206
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:53,580
that I'm able to break and you should
feel bad because I'm not really try

1207
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:57,140
I mean I am and what's my success rate

1208
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,210
so far 100 percent

1209
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:03,090
i na na

1210
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:07,750
talking about all job going into like
Haute I went and broke into a place that

1211
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,909
was right across the street from Ground
Zero

1212
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:15,400
SWAT team in I annex lobby area a
security guard in the elevator lobby

1213
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,940
x-ray machine metal detector before I
even go up to the secured lobby up on

1214
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,800
the upper floor

1215
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,949
I mean with a ballad batch

1216
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:27,540
and a t-shirt this at work shirt
detector company's computer guy

1217
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,630
this is not difficult

1218
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:35,199
stop trying to make it seem like it's
difficult in star protect your poison

1219
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,000
letting them know

1220
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,650
that is they have to %uh strengthen our
security and your partner security

1221
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:40,280
awareness

1222
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:47,280
yes me

1223
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:43,030
I've got

1224
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:48,020
his sins be spam every day it's like he
is a span he forwarded to me let me know

1225
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,130
and be aware up

1226
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:52,280
do I need all that spam now it's like

1227
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,300
I think america and he's got to the
point where he's actually spent me

1228
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:00,389
sent me spam from his home address just
to make sure that I was aware of it

1229
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:04,179
and I'm like anything in that we do it
like that he thinks that he's far the

1230
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:04,860
security thing

1231
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,070
because he now yes so you can see you
have to do that

1232
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:15,070
Ryanair yes I

1233
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:29,150
good talk and crap things 2012

1234
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:32,320
our mold a called job

1235
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,250
securing the Internet you're doing it
wrong we're actually talking about how

1236
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,340
to get permission by to the security
process

1237
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,400
and what basically when the best things
that executives

1238
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,450
walk said bizarre this or conundrum okay

1239
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:47,370
run information security right so what
are we were proactive

1240
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:51,780
we have to be proactive to I try to
mitigate risk

1241
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,880
what is business was biz

1242
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,140
talk to be reactive how to react
properly

1243
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,850
so you in information security have to
learn

1244
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,360
how to make your management proactively
react

1245
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,530
to something to make on secure and you
do that by

1246
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,530
teaching it's like show me examples of

1247
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:17,070
this company was breech because there
was no up

1248
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:22,120
a exclusionary a file access so people
with the permissions Group attacked the

1249
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:22,580
file

1250
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:27,100
i mean there are so many opportunities
right now to create a discussion with

1251
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,040
your upper management

1252
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,300
are proper security thanks to Sony I'm
and other companies

1253
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:37,670
like Target and like LinkedIn and like
who has it been punked massively

1254
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:41,560
horribly recently no one is bad it's
only right now up but

1255
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,150
still use those examples it's like a

1256
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:48,170
economic times i sorry I hope nobody
here works for sunny but you

1257
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:51,230
you should feel bad it's like so that
that's the way it works

1258
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:55,290
it's like you have to show them with
these examples so it's like you can

1259
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:59,260
but teach them in ways that they
understand and let them know that book

1260
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:03,870
your risk by having this his
exponentially greater

1261
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:07,580
if we just took this much away to out to
protect you

1262
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:11,570
it's like I promise you this is one
thing I was in a measure meeting one

1263
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,040
time

1264
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,200
with all these executives and this was
way back in the day when you actually

1265
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:16,790
had the

1266
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:21,060
update your viruses of %uh CD from a
laptop that was incorrect

1267
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:24,320
never before and my policy was to tell
them it's like what you need to make

1268
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,540
sure before your own or your company

1269
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:31,260
come the end and connect to the network
they have to put this CD and

1270
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,150
and get their virus that updated before
they got to the network to make sure

1271
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:36,280
they're not infected mission they don't
affect network

1272
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,540
and

1273
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:41,350
laughed at me but I was like hey yeah

1274
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:45,410
that's hilarious until you get infected
and then he ask you why you didn't

1275
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,840
protect him from himself

1276
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,120
then laugh at that one and at every stop
laughing

1277
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,860
and I look at what smug but still that's
the problem you

1278
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:59,680
hap to protect him from themselves you
let them know

1279
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,010
that my best interest this copy for this
thing means

1280
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:07,170
that I'm trying to manage you as a
threat because you're a potential threat

1281
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:11,470
if you are compromised and indeed what
you've built for and what you try to

1282
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,090
create

1283
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:15,750
is going to be destroyed because the
view and your permissions are what you

1284
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:18,210
had or your exceptions that you did on
security

1285
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:22,430
use exploited that to them and they're
going to go

1286
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:26,690
crap yeah you're not stupid

1287
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,910
I hate people same here the point here
bought from Gilbert they're running a

1288
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,550
company

1289
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,780
it's like both people are running
companies are pretty intelligent it's

1290
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,680
like are they don't get the right
company for very long

1291
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,580
or they get built after the government
but that's a whole other story so

1292
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,670
they're still you think you gotta watch
out for that

1293
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,970
it's like they are they know what
they're talking about if you can explain

1294
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,720
it to them in ways they can understand
about risk a mitigating that risk

1295
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:53,720
it's like you'll be ahead head in the
game I can talk for hours people

1296
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,380
anything else we good yes

1297
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:04,380
I had a

1298
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,190
rokar arm when I did that I did

1299
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:12,430
okay I broke my I had broken my arm

1300
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:18,170
icon your fault I fell in on the Dunder
falls I went 7 months later so

1301
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,890
and I climbed it one-and-a-half times
there for by restoring

1302
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:25,090
and in making up for TSO here

1304
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,110
I know that that could have been at do I
did the plan after actually a after I i

1305
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,880
fell

acting there

1310
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:47,350
Jason if you move this thing one more
little millimeter

1311
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:50,430
we're going to have to re break I i'm
apiece but

fell off or got broke off during and
another occasion which is really

1313
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,880
another story I'll tell you no time
critical areas bad on my part

1314
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,800
like our team but I broke a piece of it
today that like there's a titanium screw

1319
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:18,900
I don't know what was that

1320
