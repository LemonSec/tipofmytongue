1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,860
om red light on the device

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,339
here but hear me out there occur

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,660
well testing testing ever hear me 0 of

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,510
ok all all-star

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,800
that bus presses what but

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,800
bucks testing testing

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,809
speakers all

8
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,629
okay well good morning everybody

9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,859
later the area I D E 2050 my name is
John ship will be giving it all calls

10
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:45,859
software recall

11
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,859
islet so about me

12
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:52,339
I work at a supercomputing facility at
the NCSA

13
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:55,600
we have on the world's fastest
supercomputers they were

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,229
had a scale so very very very fast I

15
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,519
make insurance for a number of renewable
source projects including

16
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,030
than this than gtalk it the group
project and security

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,870
among a few other small ones and I'll

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,790
I also run the open network security my
ringer Shane Rogers back there

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,400
we're at I so sup University Illinois

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,950
at sarbanes champagne mice and rats

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,250
is open and collaborative group without
your orders meetings weekly

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,210
anybody can and and join it and they
could participate

23
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,060
yes your nearly every week avery doing a
project coding

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,300
and research future arrest that article

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,590
short so the problem all the problems
not

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,330
as severe as the one she is currently
facing but we do have a problem

27
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,700
trade so

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,740
typically and granola culverts we will
we see

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,860
is a virtual machine a strange right so

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,800
I can give an example is up rokahr we're
broke out part that's

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,640
in 2014 or talk a program and people
will

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,660
activities the AM ass out I'll its

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,800
and what happens is is the studies file

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,959
that case all software is very large you
quite a

35
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,840
yet that distribute this away officially
some our people ASR on USB sticks or

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,540
palatable network and there's not a very
efficient me

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,459
doing it so I am what did you have any
pic the wifi Korea

38
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,739
students have to wait at least hour or
so in light I'll

39
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,220
my observation experience the pass rush
USB 6e

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,200
ever corporate but you are people on it
and USB sticks athletes when they are

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,850
properties

42
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,200
drug it's not the most efficient way you
in some cases it works really well

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,390
but a lot of cases like it's broken we
don't actually yeah

44
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,030
other way you so nothing happened with
training as a lotta

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,430
technical difficulties right so yeah or
change

46
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,130
have hypervisor at ability crow a
configuration 3 you have to be able to

47
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,220
have a network setup properly I XI

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,450
she people where they had wrong
boss-like

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,829
Scott I D E figuration all I didn't know
what to do at

50
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,829
said such a nice looking good yet with
that puts

51
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,690
that person or group people have a
problem behind everyone else

52
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,000
so and lastly

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,040
or the that problem students directly
face

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,120
is that side being all time consuming

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,860
is about Account Manager so

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,690
which is the at outside the attic or
ship so if you do

57
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,840
what's also known as a UNIX I like all

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,300
UNIX shared system trading someone
actually brings up a

59
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,280
life UNIX system greats no harder to
work after each student at work

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,330
or training then a they actually go out
and do the state like I'll

61
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,930
the critic Eric Reid after sure that
everybody know that you take time to

62
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,320
so are one example is the Blue Water
Street supercomputer

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,700
at University of Illinois they do this
and we'll have a

64
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,230
a class say 30 students and one teacher
out your open a

65
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,630
Europa MPI high-performance programming
girl

66
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,739
think so and what to do with you have a
class commit levy admit I've

67
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,359
or create a list of all the users are
you write a script do it manually

68
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,290
and after a personal paper and the
students walk and

69
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,960
issue the paper on the desks and out in
the you that login deets

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,490
to their character they have a compiler
the program you that

71
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,770
intercourse a lecture i text okay so im
kinda cut that out by

72
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,000
somehow on a meeting all this and it
finally

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,070
from the instructor standpoint what you
do if use

74
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,450
the in this intercourse lectures are in
your training effects

75
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,200
you have you go this maturity string0
these exercises PDF

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,800
text while distributed these people and
you actually having a writ

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,350
or you're missing a file airlines case
if they're already packaged up

78
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,350
couldn't IBM everybody's p.m. got up to
date with boys or

79
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,580
incorrect party at your site go so how
do we

80
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,510
fix this version issue or mistake that
can be made with

81
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,200
well what would you do with your
actually have a git repository yours

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,900
mistake that struck working ok the
update push-up up Intel

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,590
users to: it all now corporate website
or something however

84
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,750
a

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,340
TheStreet a temporary break we're all
the students have to do that

86
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,130
and the instructor has erupting
white-hot so it's not the best way to

87
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,880
handle it either

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,230
so forties few points absolution but I
believe

89
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,420
are good enough to solve the a

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,630
in a efficient way so I'll first is

91
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,910
that simple honest how do you stop
passing around and

92
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,120
artwork the actual problem with the
strings are you simply go

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,040
culture right you don't do it you don't
need to because there's better

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,130
technology rosier technology out there
now

95
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,890
that the replacements also want to make
the

96
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,320
participation very respectful so instead
of requiring the user to have a

97
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,480
hypervisor install

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,920
right want me while require something
that's crossed but or

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,700
well supported an open standard in the
company comes to mind is

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,710
open SSH yes Rodak says right

101
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,810
you got your cell phone device which
your mobile

102
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,530
other mobile devices like tablets
although applications for that and go to

103
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,390
last year s

104
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,890
way all

105
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,410
0

106
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:38,410
you or so what

107
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,520
being is from played here actually take

108
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,060
all this stuff sport coaster the
transfer yet

109
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,500
right some thirty the work yep this is a
summary

110
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,090
so essentially make something really
easy this that the configure and deploy

111
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,210
for the cattle having such as Perry in

112
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,520
for the students and we have this

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,910
I just got your life partner for
training so it's a container system for

114
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,960
teaching public space of work

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,610
soul I what is it

116
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,380
were all Pablo I was just quit

117
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,780
a wrap-around hopefuls a

118
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,050
work in a way to get them all working
together you

119
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,130
solve this problem tree and

120
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,630
working I was just scored twice simple
three-step process at training

121
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,410
environments

122
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,300
or used overall as

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,610
poking you well i right now is
comforting

124
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,650
Hawkins hopes of earning your
organization for company

125
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,710
%uh capture the flag poles I interest
generally trying out new

126
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,860
all heroes of our you all saw it

127
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,940
laptop what Russell Courtney 17

128
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,070
told back to it out software all

129
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,410
washer washing here is my control
software him

130
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,970
fell markets so regularly shoot the
heart of its

131
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,460
I'll row or use cases source when you're
swell

132
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,010
what a creeper cerebral cortical we have
roughly route

133
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,400
users partial access you it should be

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,560
with this was not the proper diet as
well as the person about

135
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,750
also we have quit using

136
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,080
I'll official access profile historic

137
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,010
let perot used explore Center owning
this

138
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,190
all RTC 2 p.m. rights or

139
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,620
pop %uh who's also using chrome

140
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,920
your wishful I'll homie origin of this

141
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,040
as then came actual really cool

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,820
your orders cases up late the case at
University of Illinois

143
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,320
using an artificial critics to clap in
salt water

144
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,620
like volatility for every friend 6 and
for all

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,149
for their security monitoring slow or
slupic for this round

146
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,170
cetera et cetera I'll local on

147
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,670
had a proper training course that
actually is this as well

148
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,130
he's about to order is working so
closely that issue

149
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,610
if I we are using each at the UIUC but
its use a group but also

150
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,320
ok staff p what little hope for the
instructor

151
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,450
forget a technical section is I'll look
at that

152
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,750
we're what these containers saw you used

153
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,899
containers everything is recorded or for

154
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,940
man's type in the output so you can
actually go to people of

155
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,810
were director up shell you can see what

156
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,930
know where they can be a great group on
your like that week

157
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,760
okay introduced a perforation back and
the trader

158
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,640
Chris back with your spring

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,820
are buspar talk with people for so was
it because I hope

160
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,060
waste containers invite her to quit
smoking yes

161
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,209
we heard doctor are

162
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:11,190
source for alright so I'll talk a little
bit about

163
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,170
soul as you can see the picture at the
top you're pushing or forcing

164
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,870
or are horrible special hypervisor

165
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,100
well we work which are listed here
structural operating system for

166
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,329
over for this are also called
lightweight process for she

167
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:32,320
in the way this works is the cruel still
is called namespace

168
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,260
seekers Portugal way and it's
essentially provide the building blocks

169
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,890
oooh Eisley cordial 0 virus

170
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,570
and you're just not telling details
hillbilly

171
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,740
so with a virtual machines turning
writing teaching a thousand people

172
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,470
yet several thousand yes you but
actually told that a lot of work

173
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,300
I could not have the power to take your
call

174
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,010
so it is not feasible

175
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,270
in this case what comparing actually

176
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,810
do this fairly both I'm so it was really
cool

177
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,480
basic skills with the hard work was only
with her for it with a hammer and hope

178
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,440
we were going to party with you

179
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,900
cool home these containers are very
lightweight so

180
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,530
deos is noted are just enough offerings

181
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:25,820
very lightly of preach can this allows
you to get here

182
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,490
or spend a start-up time for these
containers

183
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,050
excuse to compare him back for sheen's
me up to a man right to trial

184
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,640
riser record containers girls

185
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,990
break action are with 100 head my

186
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,210
show Peter grout didn't over under on

187
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,590
but 40 airport for a millisecond for our
part 4 percent

188
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,940
stopper actually here so I was very very
fast

189
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,040
your writers and lastly

190
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,170
for the important part explain the name
pilots

191
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,800
I'll Mr salty crunchy shell access

192
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,100
for directional astrophys so just sit
there looking over

193
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,820
literacy or 2 p.m. we have terminal

194
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,000
the entire Stephanie cool it's already

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,460
because its structure card created image
for use

196
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,970
them

197
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,290
also are research home here so in this

198
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,390
I'll arches reporters paper written IBM

199
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,880
beaded performance testing up here's in
person shoes

200
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,980
russians authors here here too soccer
the performance

201
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,510
per case I'll nearly every here's doctor
exceeded her equal

202
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,940
that here never in this test

203
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,550
your permission to check that out so
popular

204
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,130
so route haven't heard this up

205
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,279
spring I so hard in this presentation

206
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,620
proper but have prompted problem I'm

207
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,870
I was rapping use your printer

208
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,339
see the stuff 2008

209
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,079
the only nah pro actual working fitting
here

210
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,130
row you to grow missing daughter and of
graph-based

211
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,110
says Rob Lowe 2013 recruits for Iran to

212
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,779
out about hearing with wrote that we
thought were

213
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,230
I'm so we're also using well

214
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,390
I'll you have normal distributions now
in schools actually

215
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,480
you all this main clustered in a row

216
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,500
containers in the cloud core OS

217
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,790
quite you already have a problem

218
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,870
commercial and you also have people who
led which can be used in many

219
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,089
how Israel and it came back to our
little over

220
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,339
people they're hosting or over early
your pockets to

221
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,600
you containers right the gals perot

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,320
annual I'll someone else get back to

223
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,459
software that I'm using that is actually
pretty easy its

224
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,339
the want this court doctor so is the
route for seven years assault but

225
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,529
going now what's really easy to use

226
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,959
and that's with you helping with the
growth the technology

227
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,670
so armies that correlate for is makes it
really easy

228
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,329
of command line tools I say hey I want
to hear doctora

229
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:28,769
what is your right near insight into
really also

230
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:33,459
group your own up you haven't seen it
what changed to it %um

231
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:36,769
think that has yet to image leaving the
industry to other people

232
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,709
well as you do that players abstract
that's what makes it so easy

233
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,510
of the oldies its technical man was
actually craving a sincere

234
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,660
doctor and will or pan

235
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,769
or more vigorous for real you're with a
are are distributed version control

236
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,290
system like ghetto

237
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,790
cool I'll doctor haass song called off

238
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,340
there you also

239
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,620
own internal I registries actually put
your container

240
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,620
images and the creek images

241
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,200
to ho using holdout the parley with the
technical so

242
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,830
valve bill people well but

243
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,270
for smaller porque no spec for racing
straight

244
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,790
I'll way to properly say living space

245
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,410
remembered everyone does their own thing

246
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,920
people I'll so inlets you have for its
implementation here

247
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,500
LXC open BCE any help people can hear it
also is let me say that for you

248
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,350
and israel's doctor on all the next

249
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,780
if there isn't authoritarian the harris
also the same crawls

250
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,470
and your historically here PST just to

251
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,710
jails for ya cool

252
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,150
to contain also Flores has souls

253
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,350
AIS has bookmark probably other
operative

254
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,270
another away analysts this ticket like
it one way to say it

255
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,950
troops 10 right so what do containers

256
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,320
like to portray you lightweight rob her
position also going across this

257
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,350
operates the them faster version with
you

258
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,210
or up so in a literal

259
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,810
got a well that were that patches were
probably

260
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,040
me are put up stream are in the mail for

261
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,300
hurdle say you have all this work out
very well

262
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,550
hero Chrissy and these two things are
worried about

263
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,680
or Jubilee loss are in spaces a

264
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,010
control so in a sports namespaces are
actually provide

265
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,300
E resource isolation so we think about
it

266
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,430
here to float processes

267
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,320
so tech yes US across right except the
separate a divided

268
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,910
have this other districts right and
these processes are in this nation case

269
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,300
property in this case basis every other
so that

270
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,230
some run PS US this namespace about it
was the only other

271
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,580
we isolate think user does not know

272
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,890
and the official abroad got no thats for

273
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,130
hurl home

274
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,220
in now never hit

275
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,840
processes net for networking you can
have network interface

276
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,140
one in space got another socially cool

277
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,490
you can also do you know about poison
difference a separate

278
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,980
also use only the other parts

279
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,070
I'll is controls so

280
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,780
this is what provides restore great
resource management on these names

281
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,860
processes are assigned to a control
seeger

282
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,740
this is what's allowed limits to you

283
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,000
are pushing to profit a whole year
example this is

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,210
see if you're up your how it all to see
you you

285
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,310
or member zook shorts megabytes

286
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,840
rail shoes particular group process in
this case

287
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,510
that's what allows hearing your refer

288
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,960
this summit great so prior to all these
cool

289
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,320
you can do this trial shell going after
saw you actually just call

290
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,650
I confess with across this book profits
go

291
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,740
were also and set out actually creating

292
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,700
reagan shelter yeah and was therefore

293
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,170
doubt it but I'll so who cares appears

294
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,950
so I think about I'll realities over or

295
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,410
for choppy here or the security out
actors in

296
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,600
and things that could go wrong right for
you text well

297
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,690
I'll want a Google phone is to disable
network unless you absolutely need

298
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,940
user right sobel to assist is we have a
loop

299
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,880
here trucks looking at now so that
turned launch attacks profits

300
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,190
our system network or other also

301
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,190
comments here procedure la troca

302
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,240
like

303
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,310
yet their communities what a great okay

304
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,910
them has I don't rip also control the
sea your allocation

305
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,360
so so you're mostar resources lawyers it

306
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,450
and I'll so you some weird you are
likely to

307
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,930
goes out so you know users over time it
is whether

308
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,170
here's a statement a holler holler say
that persistently white male

309
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,920
after a user's for use the device mapper
stored back and saw a doctor as a reply

310
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
to all local

311
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,020
they can be used or creation he yet

312
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,520
here's images and device mapper is one
