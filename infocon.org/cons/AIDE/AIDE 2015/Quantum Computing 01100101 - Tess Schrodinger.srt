1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,250
and okay good afternoon

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,590
or is

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,059
anyone here physicist or an expert in
quantum computers

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,430
you I call so hopefully I don't get how
cool too much

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,730
I love so my name so shutting I'm
security engineer with digital cloak

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,820
LLC I'm not sure if you have to legally
say that part or not

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,500
I'll this it the first thing I like to
do is explain how this talk came to be

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,590
so those have you don't know me her

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,090
haven't heard me speak before probably
5-6 years ago I knew

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,960
little to nothing about it. I the most
complicated thing I could do was but my

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,250
out of office email on

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,820
maybe put a picture in my signature that
was pretty pretty cool for me

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,899
hot in the process of getting my

14
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,800
a master's degree and security
management I had notice they're all

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,430
these options to take IT security
classes

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,460
and your I confess I was like oh that's
hard I'm a girl I can't you know so I

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,930
was like I'm not gonna go near any of
that stuff I was gonna just

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,500
they're smart people out there doing
that I'm gonna let them keep that their

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:10,930
thing

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,180
so I thought I was being pretty clever
and completely avoiding all the

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,630
cybersecurity and just staying with like
blocks indoors in

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,189
bodies and stuff and then i sat down
with my advisor for my capstone to get

23
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,409
ready to take the big final thing for
your masters

24
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,619
and he informing you know this is how it
works we're gonna have you take

25
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,630
8 you have to you get for questions

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,930
the after write a paper on each question
this is in a closed room no notes no

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,729
nothing it's completely from your ad

28
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,329
they can be on anything and I said we're
going to look at my classes I took your

29
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,369
gonna pull questions from that right he
goes on

30
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,799
now now if we give you a master's in
scary management you better be a master

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,040
so if there's any areas you might have
you know not covered role well you might

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,110
want to catch up on us

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,159
so this prompted a

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
hysterical dash down the hallway to my
then bosses are my mentors office

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,770
to which I said oh my god you have to
make me

36
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,700
a master I love IT security in six
months

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,920
and he said now problem on and

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,620
suddenly I am so in the course love this

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,330
%uh pounding all this stuff into my head
over six months

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,900
and I'm actually proud to say that to
the questions when i sat down that day

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,739
were on

42
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,560
cybersecurity and they were the two
questions for the highest on

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,900
for the papers so I i think I did really
well but that thing that really captured

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,360
me

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,110
during all this learning was how in
trouble

46
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,560
I T is to regular security a lotta

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,220
standards carry folks don't realize that
they still think like I did at the time

48
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,579
that something those smart people do
with the machines and

49
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,900
you know the hacking and all that and

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,170
through all the stunning I did it really
became so clear to me how

51
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,920
in trouble it's all just coming together
now there's no way you can be

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,480
just one or the other you've really got
to kind of know both of them as we go

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,430
into the future

54
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,739
but during the course of all this
studying I got so interested in it I

55
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,700
actually

56
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,389
once I got the the regular masters I
went for the Masters

57
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,829
and cyber security technology from UMUC
cuz now I wanted to bike really get into

58
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,079
it

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,530
I didn't want to just cram cuz I needed
to just on the side

60
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,840
I really got fascinated with it so I
want to learn more and I want to get

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,209
better actually once I get my hands on
things

62
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,260
and during the courses that

63
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,500
graduate work I started running into all
these comments here and there on

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,910
you know when quantum computers become
viable

65
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,760
encryption as we know it is gonna go out
the window

66
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,889
its dubious Troy nothing will be secure
ever again oh my god you know like the

67
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:46,900
sky is falling

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,780
and I wanted to know why so of course I
went to my mentor and I said hey

69
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,849
why and he looked at me and he said

70
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:59,720
I have no clue which that kind of
stunned me for a moment because he's

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,030
probably the smartest man I know and I
thought I knew everything and and he

72
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,530
didn't

73
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,079
so that I went to another friend that
you know is an IT and I said of high and

74
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,160
he just looked at me and said

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,030
beats the shit outta me I don't now and
I'm going well

76
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,920
you know wait a minute so then I started
going to these cons right

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,670
Def Con you know these like really smart
people at it.

78
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,420
surely they would be talking about this
send and I'd go through the

79
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,460
than schedules and I'd look for sand
there be nothing

80
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,640
so what do you do when you're a hacker
and you don't know how something works

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,820
there's nobody there to tell you you
figure it out yourself

82
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,240
so what this talk is is me basically
going why

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,940
why why and nobody out there could tell
me why

84
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,700
so I had figured out myself and to kinda
justified the 3 o'clock

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,390
3 o'clock in the morning reading and do
all the work I was doing I thought maybe

86
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,300
just talk about this I don't feel like

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,590
the most enormous week on the planet
just trying to figure out why for myself

88
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,990
so I

89
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,350
kind to myself I was doing this for all
you guys to so that's kinda how I

90
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,190
justify some

91
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,110
at on so the day we're going over some
classical physics versus quantum physics

92
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,130
on I really make a huge attempt to keep
this talk

93
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,790
at a level that everyone can understand
my 10-year-old daughter has stopped her

94
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,840
and she got it

95
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,060
so so hopefully you guys okay to I will
go

96
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,860
once we get some common vocabulary via
that will do some Costco computers risk

97
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,690
on computers

98
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,180
and then we'll do a little bit of
quantum key crypto graffiti

99
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,760
on some quantum packing for those who
don't realize it

100
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,180
I your about 10 years late to the party
they've then quantum packing for quite

101
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,210
some time now believe it or not so I'll
go over a little bit of that

102
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,400
and then of course and anyone who's done
significant on a crowd work now you have

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,140
to have a proper conclusion for
everything so we'll have one at that

104
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,480
this

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,920
so little bit more about myself

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,840
hmmm I started out and forensics I tell
people I was

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,240
bullets in blood not ones and zeros so
back when

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,570
I was I'll wearing a badge in carrying a
gun

109
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,850
we didn't really ever encounter
computers RIT at all and if we rarely

110
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,560
stumbled upon one

111
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,850
other crimes I'm kinda really old so we
didn't not everybody I computers

112
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,360
their houses bet but so we didn't really
run into that a lot so my background is

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,790
primarily and

114
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,030
and law enforcement security
counterintelligence and

115
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,480
regular hold some blood friends ex and

116
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,970
within the last five six years i've made
the shift over

117
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,160
on my mentor then my new boss now

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,160
on welcome you with open arms and as
give me my first big girl I T

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,290
for real job so I'm real proud about I

120
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,640
and I have an undergrad and I have a

121
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,690
associates in physics I have a BA in
Sociology

122
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,050
as that's really important I know how
people think and how group of people

123
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,480
think

124
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,180
I love my Masters is in security
management of course have the kreitzer

125
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,890
from my %um you see in cyber security
technology I do have one little certain

126
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,960
my security plus

127
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,450
you do any work in DC could have
happened it does and I'm kinda looking

128
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,100
at like what am I gonna do next

129
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,430
go so stop some Costco physics worse
quantum physics

130
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,350
day this is where I ask you to take the
red pill

131
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,190
okay for those of you who are not
familiar at all with chronic annex

132
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,290
on Neil's bores famous process and he
once said

133
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,470
if quantum mechanics has a profoundly
shocked you

134
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,710
then you don't understand it yet I

135
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,950
it can get a little squirrely and idk

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,670
kinda requires you to come to think a
lot differently than maybe you're used

137
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,390
to thinking

138
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,390
so just kinda relax a little

139
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,430
you know that the braying go

140
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,840
so two feet up if you need to on

141
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,940
I will try make this painless you Tony
in physics

142
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,210
is probably what most if you all learned
in school okay

143
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,680
there this is trajectory base

144
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,530
physics okay so if you have a particle

145
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,800
right alright object or an item and you
know the position

146
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,830
axe at some given time t and then you
know any

147
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,270
factors affecting its just grab a beer
wind shear

148
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,830
you know the temperature at cetera you
can pretty much know where that particle

149
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,660
was going to be in it's trajectory

150
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,380
okay I would anyone like particle more

151
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,490
were so you can see the trajectory about
particle

152
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,970
anyone else or

153
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,990
okay so what anytime

154
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,810
I can calculate where that particle has
been

155
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,000
where that particle is or

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,260
where it will be thank you to all that
information for it

157
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,510
as it goes through that trajectory in
San think a classical physics that way

158
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,520
your any this

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,970
is a picture of an Electra item that
you're probably familiar with from

160
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,560
school

161
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm like getting old enough now that I
don't know what some younger kids hide

162
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,430
your text books

163
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,970
but this my model on Adam is about
seventy years out-of-date

164
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,140
okay so this is what you grow up knowing
is an Adam

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,770
this isn't very accurate why

166
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,180
always physicists when and took
classical physics

167
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,390
and applied it to this mod 11 at 0

168
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,250
it collapsed in on itself in like

169
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,550
it's on the second well we know that
doesn't happen

170
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,220
so something else had to be going on
here

171
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,900
okay on does this mean we throw
classical physics out the window

172
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,439
now no cuz classical physics is only
flawed when you're dealing with things

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,660
that are not very very tiny sub-atomic
level

174
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,590
and that's when quantum mechanics is
gonna take over or when you're dealing

175
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,680
with things

176
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,880
that are approaching the speed of light
and that's when you're relativity theory

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,910
is going to take over

178
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,670
for stuff in between classical physics
is sufficient

179
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,090
and is also a lot easier to use that
math and the

180
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,170
relativity or the the qua non stop so
it's

181
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,850
it's sufficient if you want to know
ballistics at a crime scene or a

182
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,750
basketball trajectory Dr

183
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,160
you know the egg drop from class in high
school but

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,870
on once you get into those specialized
areas there's the subatomic or the speed

185
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,390
of light

186
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,740
you're gonna have to go into a
difference at a map and that's gonna

187
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,370
take us into the quantum physics

188
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,590
okay or what's

189
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,860
the whatever anyways I heard it
described up by it

190
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,360
quantum chemistry teacher was in
classical physics

191
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,950
if I drop this ball on the table let's
hope I catch it's not like an idiot

192
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,190
okay we can calculate

193
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,370
the drop the gravity we know it's gonna
hit this we can calculate it coming

194
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,800
we can calculate all this because in
classical physics everytime I dropped

195
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,780
this Paul

196
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,900
its gonna go straight down depending on

197
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,110
you know for joined us to win comes I
could change things gonna go straight

198
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,710
down

199
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,710
gonna hit that table and its gonna come
straight back up

200
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,950
right in quantum physics

201
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,530
I can drop this fall and it might

202
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,329
hit the table I'm it might

203
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,679
up in that corner it just might break
out of existence and unabomber there

204
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,420
it could come all the way to hear vanish
reappear

205
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,119
and most appear to go straight to the
table but not it just it's no longer

206
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:39,709
here

207
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,600
and suddenly it's here so things are
going to get a little weird when you get

208
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,489
into the sub-atomic level because

209
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:50,379
instead of dealing with trajectories
you're now dealing with probabilities

210
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:54,569
now this is a more current model

211
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:58,279
a van atter okay they were able to

212
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,079
lookout protons and neutrons and they
determined that

213
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,769
they actually had a substructure okayed
the electron at this time is still

214
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,739
considered an elementary particle
meaning

215
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:12,860
it does not have a known substructure or

216
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,999
they're pretty confident doesn't have
one things can always change arlo

217
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,389
physics a but with the proton and
neutron they determine there is a

218
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,489
substructure

219
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:25,220
up things called quarks okay there's are
smaller particles that make

220
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,290
up the proton and neutron or

221
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,889
her is your quarks much

222
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,619
I just think these are adorable but this
was ni cuz it kinda describe the

223
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:40,470
relationships between you have up down
top bottom Charmin strange

224
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,040
up and down are gonna be a I'm

225
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,999
they have the lowest mass and they're
the most common they're the ones you're

226
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,949
gonna find in your everyday items like

227
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,639
twenties and chairs and you know gray
hair days I

228
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,600
the other ones the charm bottom are the
charms strange

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,679
those are found in more are like high

230
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,910
energy sourdough environments like
cosmic rays or

231
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,369
particle accelerator its earn you're
gonna find those types of quarks

232
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,000
or yeah

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,940
or now there are four key experiments in
Costco physics

234
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,570
that kinda brought about like the
downfall I guess you could say

235
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,720
or the first ones punks you the
catastrophe

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,290
as there's an interesting trivia I love
trivia on catastrophe doesn't always

237
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,470
mean a disaster

238
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,080
okay abrupt changes in direction or
velocity

239
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,430
on a graph or a chart are called
catastrophic points and math so there's

240
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,200
actually an entire field

241
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,790
math that deals with this call
catastrophe theory so

242
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,140
Max Planck was a German theoretical
physicist and I'm known for some years

243
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,530
out there so you can realize it's just
hasn't happened recently this is going

244
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,110
on in 1918

245
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,480
he won the Nobel Prize for on putting
forth quantum theory

246
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,560
and the catastrophe was that

247
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,370
you know when you heat something up the
color changes

248
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,320
and it goes kinda from yellow to red to
whyy

249
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,350
well as you hit something up you see
more

250
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,560
wavelengths being admitted so that's why
when you get to the white

251
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,530
you see it like all the wavelengths and
you're getting that really high

252
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,700
temperature and then as it cools down
again you see the

253
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,320
the reverse happen right so the some
scientists said

254
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,200
this would be cool cuz we could probably
predict this on a curve on a graph

255
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,310
right well they sat down to do that

256
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,530
and it worked really great until
suddenly it didn't

257
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,950
suddenly it's like the whole thing fell
apart and that's what they call the UV

258
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,680
catastrophe was when this crap just
suddenly

259
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,550
out the window something happened and it
something else is going on again at the

260
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,580
sub-atomic level

261
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,140
so this wasn't talk had to figure out
what was going on and he came up with

262
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,540
some equations that stated radiation
columns

263
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,570
in little tiny packets which he called
photons or

264
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,200
alright Star Trek fans will be forever
grateful now so

265
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,600
eisenstein use this photon equation

266
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,750
set up clock to describe the
photoelectric effect are you guys may I

267
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,119
thought

268
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,169
this was on actually like people think
he won the Nobel Prize for his theory of

269
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:18,189
relativity but he actually wanted for
this the federal electric back in this

270
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:20,720
is basically for those who don't know
when you shine light

271
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,009
ontem at all the on the car there's a
current little closer and that's because

272
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:26,749
the

273
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,549
electrons in a light are giving our
energy to the electrons in the matalin

274
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,709
they're producing a current

275
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,709
the third one was too bro least

276
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,739
dot discovery up the wave-like behavior
particles

277
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:42,209
on as I wanted her to the double slit
slit experiment

278
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:47,209
okay so for those basically two burly
put out that

279
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,989
I'll that particles don't always

280
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,899
act just like particles X have a wave
nature he apply this to electrons in a

281
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,600
theoretical paper and then to scientists
came behind him about two or three years

282
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,350
later

283
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,789
and experimentally confirmed his
hypothesis

284
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:09,639
okay me and last one was Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle

285
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,439
and if you don't know what it looks like
I actually had a tattooed on my arm

286
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,160
right here

287
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,160
was it later on high school in Berks

288
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,389
principal goes thoughts

289
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,220
if you no the position

290
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,169
a particle you can never know

291
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,609
it's not lost their instruction arts
Peter anything even only know the

292
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:35,189
position

293
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,709
and if you know the velocity or the
speed

294
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,529
you can never know exactly where this
okay

295
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,859
and to illustrate this so I'm a big

296
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:49,209
I know that but the pants basha
Schweinsteiger Germany

297
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,350
firing Munich on in classical soccer
think about it this way

298
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,289
if you're a keeper goalie and you're
watching him

299
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:01,279
what two things you need to know if
you're preparing for him to kick that

300
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,079
ball at you

301
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,020
you need to know where the ball is

302
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,630
and how fast and what direction is
coming at you right and in classical

303
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,630
physics or Costco soccer

304
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,630
this is great you can do this or in
quantum soccer

305
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,540
right quantum soccer if I'm the keeper

306
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,500
if I want to know exactly where that
ball is I can know that

307
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,110
completely 100 percent or

308
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:37,110
but I will never know which direction is
gonna go on right

309
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,130
or I can know exactly

310
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,170
the velocity and direction that ball's
coming at me from

311
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,350
but I can never know exactly the
position of the ball

312
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,350
okay so hopefully I kinda gives you a
headcanon

313
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,330
I on couple other concepts companies
will help when we get to computers we

314
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,720
have entanglement

315
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,300
and tangled it refers to the behavior
when yup particles

316
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,450
that up interact they can

317
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,890
I guess a good way maybe to imprint on
each other

318
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,320
and so up he's my particles again if you
have

319
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,720
the blue and the pink when they interact
there are automatically going to take an

320
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,330
office it's been to each other

321
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,250
right so when they separate go wherever
they go in the universe

322
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,460
if anything affects this ball over the
particle over here

323
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,240
to make it spend differently this one
instantaneously

324
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,020
for will flip it spent so that they're
always offices

325
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,890
okay and it may not seem pretty stunning
if you're thinking like

326
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,940
in the same room are at a different
table but

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,630
they actually been able to confirm this
happens like

328
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,060
across continents and even in space

329
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,840
and it happens instantaneously which
again in one room may not be a big deal

330
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,669
but when you look at some other
distances

331
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:09,230
this has happened that the communication

332
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,620
I'm using that word were loosely now on
appears to break the speed of light

333
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,850
boundaries okay on and albert Einstein
actually called this spooky action at a

334
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,350
distance he hated this

335
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,620
he Apsley aboard this thought he
couldn't he can argue it didn't happen

336
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,769
but he just didn't like it

337
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:30,289
and if you're familiar with his quote
God does not play dice with the universe

338
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:33,610
that's where he came up with a quote for
this

339
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,539
and ash I think another physicist like a
member which one it was we butted him

340
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,760
that might have been talking but I could
be wrong inside

341
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,490
God does play dice in the universe and
sometimes he throws a more you can't see

342
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,889
them

343
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:49,570
like think we have a working vocabulary
now to get into the quantum computers

344
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,149
worse is a classical computers

345
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,679
be as everyone here familiar with the
turning machine

346
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,970
okay okay

347
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,059
so the turning machine basically is a
visual

348
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,110
conceptual representation of how data is
processed through Costco computer

349
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,519
okay and each peace that goes through

350
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,929
is your bit right committed information
okay in

351
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,990
quantum computers instead of calling

352
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,340
a piece of information a bit we call it
were very clever and physics 8

353
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,419
hugh bit right and this is what a cube
it looks like and I know it's true

354
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,130
because I found on Wikipedia

355
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,090
sheik Adarsh representation

356
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,100
cubit on is go

357
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,950
this is going to take us to
superposition Schrodinger's cat

358
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,419
I'm most people are probably familiar
with this

359
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,549
but to on just to to go back over again

360
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:51,059
in 1935 for when Schrodinger

361
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,149
a famous physicist in a quantum field
put together a

362
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,630
thought experiment this was not really
dunno

363
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,690
cats were harmed ok all pita okay

364
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,299
but he was trying to illustrate the
superposition concept

365
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,539
so the thought experiment goes is this
you have a cat a steel chamber

366
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,820
okay in a steel chamber is a radioactive
substance

367
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,760
along with the device holding hydro
Scion iQ asset now

368
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,389
if any other this substance TK's it trip
some sort of hammer

369
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:26,279
it breaks the file releases the gas and
it kills the cat okay

370
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,169
Schrodinger said as long as the box is
closed

371
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,419
the cat exists in this state
superposition

372
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,830
meaning it's a both alive and dad act

373
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,309
the same time your

374
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:45,039
okay it's not until we open the box

375
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,190
we observe the cat we collapsed

376
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,799
the way function that the cat becomes
either dead or alive

377
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,049
with me so far is really important this
is like the big one

378
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,610
K okay this is on

379
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,980
for some they might say on the bottom
the Copenhagen interpretation there's

380
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,700
actually

381
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,769
if you're interested later and you want
to go Google like I do

382
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:14,600
there's I think at last count 15 major
interpretations of quantum physics

383
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,389
so this is that particular school on
Schrodinger and Heisenberg

384
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:22,789
actually members about school but
there's a couple others like the many

385
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:23,570
worlds

386
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,029
where there's there's Seery and

387
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:30,759
supposedly quantum evidence to show that
there's not just

388
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,379
our universe there's like a buncha
different universes but they're all

389
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:35,950
together in one multiverse

390
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,769
so you may have like in another universe
my but not as big as it is now

391
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,519
our you now I have four legs or
something so there's the multiverse

392
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,309
there and there's a branching universe

393
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,009
area where supposedly every time it a
decision is made

394
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:53,460
the universe branches into two different
ones with two different result in

395
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,320
consequences

396
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,970
it's pretty fascinating if you're
interested you can sleep at night so

397
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,500
superposition is important because this
is how quantum computers

398
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,870
get their stuff done faster which is
gonna

399
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,070
con critically and handy when we won
start breaking encryption

400
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,250
okay so if you look at this cubit its it
exists in a state of superposition

401
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,830
okay when in a classical computer your
bit can be

402
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,559
a1 or a zero the queue that can be a one

403
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:29,289
80 at same time okay

404
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:31,630
this may be a better picture

405
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,580
okay so

406
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,290
parallelism so in your class cool
computers a parallelism you basically

407
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,450
have several processors that are linked
together and they can all do

408
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,610
kinda different stuff at the same time
well

409
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,970
in quantum computing a single quantum
processor

410
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,060
can basically if you picture that
turning machine I can't find a picture

411
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,490
of a quiet drinking at

412
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,680
even the supposedly one exists in theory
on

413
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,780
on that strip the paper instead of
seeing a zero

414
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,570
or a1 you can see a zero and one at same
time in the computer processors both

415
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,870
at the same time and that's is that is
what

416
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,570
speeds up your processing with the
quantum computers

417
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:20,210
so far forget okay and now this is this
will be funny now because you understand

418
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,710
it

419
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,180
any so

420
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,480
have a little time line just kinda put
some stuff in perspective with where

421
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,270
the environments been going so in
nineteen eighty

422
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,000
a Russian mathematician named Mary manin
he's the one who first proposed the idea

423
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,350
fine computing

424
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,480
okay and an 81 Richard fine man he's an
american theoretical physicist he

425
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,960
proposed kinda the basic model

426
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,720
for this quantum computer call Ben of
another american physicist he proposed

427
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
the first

428
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,630
kinda theoretical framework for that
quantum computer

429
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,940
and then %uh David Deutsch

430
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,450
his west side University Oxford he's the
one that suppose we conceptualize the

431
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,690
quantum Turing machine

432
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,890
again can't find a pet rabbit that
supposedly he's put that together in

433
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,120
ninety-one Arthur eckardt with Oxford
also invented

434
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,600
entanglement based secure encryption %uh

435
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,770
this is an 81 in 2003

436
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,920
2003's is more than ten years ago

437
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,560
darkness quantum network became fully
operational that year

438
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,760
to dark Rd has and has had a quantum
network

439
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,050
I'll in 05 the first kiss you bite is
announced have been created by

440
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,160
scientists

441
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,470
in Austria and

442
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:43,340
I in 07 a company called e-waste Systems
claim to have the first working 28 that

443
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,470
quantum computer

444
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,950
on a little bit about d-wave

445
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,780
I I met one person who's supposedly
works with them

446
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,390
I will set it do a proper has been the
best of SAC as far as

447
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,610
security around what they do that nobody
knows what they do

448
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,030
nobody actually knows if they actually
do anything that's how good they are

449
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,440
I have had about 30 percent of people I
talk to tell me that d-wave

450
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,820
is the genius tank these are the people
that are gonna

451
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,170
just you know revolutionize computing

452
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,350
and then I've had fifty percent people I
talk to say they are all completely full

453
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,960
a crap

454
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,240
they don't do anything all their claims
RPS her

455
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,780
and since they don't really share
anything they do it's really hard to

456
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,860
substantiate sum up what they've done so

457
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,679
this is what they've supposedly done I
will leave it to you to decide if you

458
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,700
believe it or not

459
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,660
on in 08 supposedly they had a 128 bit
camps

460
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,730
a 128 cubic computer chip and then in
2009 supposedly Google started

461
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,890
collaborating with them

462
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:50,470
on image search technology using quantum
computing and 2013 we had coherent

463
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,360
superposition

464
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,059
up an ensemble up approximately three
million cubits for 39 minutes at room

465
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,320
temperature now this is a big deal
because the previous record

466
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,750
for that was two seconds okay

467
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,830
on in 2014 scientists transfer data via
quantum teleportation

468
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,270
over distances 10 feet with zero percent
air

469
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,309
and in 2015 this was the week before a

470
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:19,929
presented this issue con all there was
an arse technical article that research

471
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,630
had are researchers created quite a
memory that stable for six

472
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,790
hours in a very strong magnetic field at
close to absolute zero

473
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,770
and then right for b-sides charm I found

474
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,200
this this is actually kinda just really
cool soon these guys in the Swiss

475
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,250
Federal ISU technology have

476
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,549
devised an experiment to photograph the
light

477
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:45,570
as both a particle and a wave and

478
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,230
there it is to I thought that was really
or

479
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,630
so why

480
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,990
its now this takes us all back to why
did I start this in the first place like

481
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,990
so what does that have to do with
cryptography

482
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,320
right what what's the deal so

483
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,320
in 1994 idoney Peter short AT&T

484
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,910
came up with an algorithm that would
allow quantum computers to factor in

485
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,330
very large integers

486
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,190
very quickly okay and this algorithm

487
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,809
ken theoretically break allure

488
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:25,419
a lot of the cryptosystems in use today
basically most anything based on

489
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:26,690
factoring Risa

490
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,730
okay and the numbers I have RA can
factor a 1000 digit number in about 20

491
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,330
minutes

492
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,210
a classical computer would take about 10
million billion years to do that

493
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,710
and this is because about ability to do
the superposition

494
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,000
and tits the parallel processing and a
quantum computer

495
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,250
so

496
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,470
a little bit on quantum cryptography
this was actually

497
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,980
I i think all this is fascinating I will
be talking about it on

498
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,669
quantum cryptography basically is this

499
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,429
physics instead of math to encrypt your
data

500
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:12,429
okay go but you're actually using
straight I'm gonna go and how it how

501
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,220
it's done

502
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,910
you actually are using physics not
massey you can't use math

503
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,409
to break that

504
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:23,370
I'm pickle okay

505
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,900
so we all know also bob right

506
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,500
up so how do we do this so

507
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,610
we create a key using photons so

508
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,710
your polarized light articles again

509
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,789
so polarized light and unpolarized light

510
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:47,190
when lights unpolarized can basically of
late in any direction

511
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,620
right it's not like it's just all over
the place like my hair Sunday

512
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,120
on when you polarize it you'll pass it
through a filter

513
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,770
the kind of walks into specifics panic
the diagonal

514
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,820
the up-and-down Bieber to call
horizontal whatever

515
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,840
but it kinda walks into a spin state

516
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,990
incident being all over the place I'm so

517
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,480
what they do is they use these filters
and the crate

518
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,750
the they create the photons using LED's
and then they passed the photon through

519
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,390
filter

520
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,970
okay and the filter fixes it into a spin
state your

521
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,149
okay so if you fix this one into a
vertical

522
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:31,320
spin state the only way you can properly
read this particle on the other end on

523
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,200
the receiving end

524
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,770
is if you have a vertical filter to read
it through if you place

525
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,070
our a horizontal filter then that filter
is gonna change

526
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,510
here spend state or it's just not gonna
pastor is gonna give you know

527
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,610
reading you're not gonna get any okay
yeah

528
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,590
or so the way we do this is

529
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,240
alice is gonna transfer some random bits

530
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,790
using random polarizations okay so she's
gonna take her filters and set him up

531
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,640
randomly

532
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,800
and then she's gonna pick some numbers
and she's gonna send them through

533
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,950
just everything's random okay on the
other end

534
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,390
follow-up has no clue you now

535
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,710
so he's just gonna set is filters out

536
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,930
sit back and see what happens he just
gonna picks up okay

537
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,390
or now

538
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,080
Alice can call Bob

539
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,740
and give him her list a polarization is
not that that she sent

540
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,920
just the polarizations and then by

541
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,110
can sit down and say okay her we use the
same polarization here so I know that

542
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,780
the bit that came through here is

543
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:53,580
this one is correct right didn't get
changed and so what they do is the Union

544
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,070
up there to SATs

545
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,350
that becomes your key I'm

546
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,240
we get got it alright it took me weeks
to get this

547
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,390
figured out straight a lot so why part
time with my developers they were so

548
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:08,800
good

549
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,030
so what about to leave then

550
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,110
or well you can't do a

551
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,630
traditional man in the middle attack
because any attend two major or to

552
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,220
observe or two

553
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,230
anything to a fact that communication is
going to skew

554
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:30,230
what happened and Bob and alice when
they talk are going to realize

555
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,720
something skewed it and they can scrap
it not use it

556
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,650
and go about you know taking another
time another place your are

557
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,090
are trying to generate another key where
she might not be able to get it I'll

558
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,810
home the

559
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,700
to known attacks for this kind of thing
because I can remember using

560
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,530
LED's new using the filters say he can't

561
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,620
you know that's like traditional
cracking a separate you can just do that

562
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,290
I'll excusing

563
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:09,290
I'm said the one way the one thing I
found so far lesser something I don't

564
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,720
know or haven't seen as

565
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,560
this all has to be done overly
fiber-optic lines so it's not in the

566
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,670
wifi stage at

567
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,920
so the one attack would be just a denial
of service type attack or you just click

568
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,890
the line in a

569
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,590
can't talk on the other one would be
instead of going after the apparatus

570
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,260
that creates the photons and that does
the filters you would go

571
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,950
after the random number generator thats

572
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,170
sets them see you kinda get in front of
it that way maybe go after random number

573
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,860
generator

574
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,390
so this kinda takes us into the quantum
hacking which like I said it's been

575
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,620
about 10 years

576
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,210
since they've been doing this and

577
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,940
I

578
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,700
Planck Institute in Germany so this
gentleman named meet in johnnie

579
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,890
Patrick announces name right on

580
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,960
may figured out that

581
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,290
Eve could take a laser

582
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,010
and she couldn't balance that of alice
is

583
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,240
filters and she could get a reading

584
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,850
about everything on the other hand right
without interfering with communication

585
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:22,340
so they said okay so they figured out
they could put something in place called

586
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,190
isolator

587
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,420
which one allow any up her

588
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,690
on like to come in or it would notify
Alyssa flight was coming in on the other

589
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,480
and she can

590
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,810
yes crop the eight the effort and know
that someone was trying to interfere

591
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,300
any but what was interesting was

592
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,370
because you know I think there's a
sister just as much hikers some other

593
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:42,940
SMS

594
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,090
they thought you know what test this
because

595
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:51,340
at the whaling sweet rich typically use
for telecommunications

596
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,480
ice layer worked fabulously you know
they were able to detect that laser

597
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,190
coming in

598
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,580
but if evert a drop-down the band with
ergo

599
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,520
up a little bit she was able to
completely get past it and no one knew

600
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,910
so that name have on

601
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,680
some other things that they thought
about putting in place some active

602
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,890
listening devices

603
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,070
that could I did tact that typeof

604
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,000
incoming light so if you combine that
with the isolator than that kinda pretty

605
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,300
much rosy about

606
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,880
but again this is all ten years ago I
haven't found a lot of

607
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,090
recent research think that's been
published that I've

608
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,080
been able to get through on that's gone
into anything else that's happened in

609
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,120
the field since then

610
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,180
but there's your quantum

611
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,450
packing so

612
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,470
with the quantum computers the big

613
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,320
issue has to do round the factoring and
how easy are essay

614
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,730
and basically any type of cricket Tom
Murphy that's based on factoring

615
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,790
is to break using schorr's our okay

616
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,990
so this has prompted this huge newfield

617
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,580
but actually wasn't aware about the
first time I gave the stock and then

618
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,350
someone asked me during the talk or what
about

619
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,570
ates and I had absolutely no idea

620
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,670
so I promised him to go find out

621
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,810
and that kinda for open this door in to
post a quantum cryptography

622
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,940
which you know it's time I knew nothing
about there isn't

623
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,200
they're looking at a lot of alternatives
to factoring so one of the things is

624
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,350
lattices recently with lattice

625
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:33,760
mathematics so there's a lot of really
good YouTube videos cuz I've watched

626
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,990
almost every single one of them strike
understand it

627
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,930
lattice problems are typically really
hard

628
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,060
they're basically when you have

629
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,030
you could have this is like a two-time

630
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,910
two-dimensional it tried to make a look
three-dimensional representation beat

631
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,680
basically it's a setup points

632
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,970
okay and there's a sad love problems

633
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,540
that you have to figure out when you're
dealing with a lot of environment like

634
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,460
shortest vector problem

635
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,340
on there are no known

636
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:11,820
algorithms to solve face incredibly hard
mathematics

637
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,740
and there's no quick efficient way to do
this kinda mathematics

638
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,750
of at first I thought lattice

639
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,310
sounded like it was being like this is
the answer everyone start using this but

640
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:26,360
the more I've read it looks like it's
still in the stage where it's so

641
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,570
difficult that

642
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,880
using it efficiently from the
cryptographic perspective in

643
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,860
communications

644
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:37,100
not quite sure they're ready for that
yet I think it's still very theoretical

645
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,970
another thing they're talking about is
electrical curve cryptography

646
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,839
on electrical hurts

647
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:48,749
want to lay with that anyone okay so

648
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:52,539
with with réessayer with factoring
basically you have numbers and you're

649
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,390
looking for the prime and use kinda
trying to narrow it down

650
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:00,180
with elliptical curve which if I
actually get to talk at blackhat and

651
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,210
DEFCON I will have slides on this so
they'll explain about arkansas has

652
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,359
figured out that are on you have

653
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:11,150
a curve and instead of trying to find a
range of numbers

654
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,170
like factoring you're actually trying to
find all the points

655
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,099
along a specific part this curve that
have to do with an intersection

656
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:22,999
and they're not quite sure her

657
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:26,609
mathematically in even elliptical curve
cryptography

658
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:30,059
it's been used for some stuff I think
like blackberry yes

659
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:33,109
some sort implementation of it but it's
still

660
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:37,769
really they're working on it and the
other thing with electrical curve I'm

661
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,019
actually reading other

662
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:44,569
a book on posts concrete talker P where
there's people arguing about

663
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:47,920
the polynomial base a political her
makes it just is

664
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,930
is bowler bowler's factoring

665
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:55,019
I I'm still at 32 pages into the book so
hopefully I'll have that done by then

666
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:58,180
next time I present something and I can
share more

667
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,650
on cuz I just started diving into this
in the last month or two

668
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,369
when I was asked that question but the
big advantages again with the lodge

669
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:07,200
cryptography that they're saying now is

670
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,160
on over the up over the elliptical curve

671
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,299
it's definitely a lot harder and

672
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:19,529
there are a lot closer to finding more
efficient algorithms with the large coke

673
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:20,099
her

674
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,630
because it's been around a lot longer
and it's been kinda attacked them played

675
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,650
with a lot longer

676
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:29,779
then the lattice house so that's really
why they're pushing lattice big but

677
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:30,599
again

678
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,369
only 32 pages n I'll have more data next
time I dot probably

679
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,739
so where does that leave us

680
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:44,089
the big

681
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:44,790
things that I

682
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,790
took away from my research are I
understand better now why

683
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:53,860
traditional crib talker PRSA factory
type stuff is an incredibly vulnerable

684
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,260
because this algorithm is basically
gonna go

685
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,870
it's going like there's an app for that
the you're done on

686
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,760
their are people really trying hard to
come up with an alternative

687
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,370
to that type of photography what but
there are still a lot of incredibly

688
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,650
brilliant people

689
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,920
who really aren't too sure about it I
think anyone who study crypto gripping

690
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,820
knows that there's

691
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,090
so much testing and attacking and and

692
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,900
it's not just you can kinda pull out
your pocket having a cryptosystem the

693
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,470
next day there's really a lot a
stringent stuff that goes through before

694
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,040
like people will agree that it's going
to be effective and safe to use and it's

695
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,840
just not

696
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,980
I think anything has gone that far down
the path yet

697
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,040
to really be considered a replacement
for

698
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,180
factoring in a quantum thing and the
reason the only big reason right now

699
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,510
that the lattice

700
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,010
and elliptical and everything else is
considered you know secure

701
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,880
is because essentially it would take a
classical computer and a quantum

702
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,060
computer the same amount of time to
break it

703
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,650
so if anyone pops up tomorrow or next
week and goes well

704
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,300
now the rhythm were right back to where
we are right now with the factory

705
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,320
okay so it's it's almost like a a crypto
arms race if you think about it

706
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,580
%uh there's also a big challenge
creating the technology because %uh the

707
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,000
magnetic fields and

708
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,840
extremely low temperatures required you
know as i said you know 39 minutes

709
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,390
it room temperature thats not gonna work
for day to day it's not likely be

710
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,820
carrying the stuff on your pocket
anytime soon

711
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,300
on we're still really far from Lee
having this is kind of a viable

712
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,370
in your kitchen on your desktop
technology anytime really soon

713
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,040
but there are a lot alike really smart
people and really

714
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,960
rich people and countries in
organizations that are

715
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,310
probably a little further along than we
know as far as like

716
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,990
common knowledge

717
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,470
on but it's not something i think is
like really on the horizon yet I think

718
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,320
the last thing I read about

719
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,850
viability was the current quantum
computer the d-wave claims to have can

720
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,130
solve a Sudoku puzzle

721
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,890
that's about where it's at so

722
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,630
him kinda extrapolate from there and

723
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,310
and that's why it took so hopefully you
found it interesting and learn something

724
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,460
and does anyone have any questions are

725
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:25,460
comments are smart remarks ho

726
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,630
were while very much so it's

727
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,970
was just looking at the fact that you're
using physics to encrypt something

728
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:40,830
versus

729
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,480
math or you now on and then

730
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,940
the the hardware and infrastructure type
requirements to actually

731
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,120
have this I'm and any sort of viable

732
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,600
networking type environment are like
super deployed type environment are

733
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,130
are still pretty now there's some really
interesting stuff that they've put out

734
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,850
there with

735
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:05,170
cloud computing where they've talked
about using cloud

736
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,500
that cloud environment for processing

737
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,690
because if you can put it there are

738
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,720
and it's not observed or measured then
you can

739
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,650
put in an environment where they can
calculate in a super

740
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,070
position state because it's not being
observed and then

741
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,970
once it's done when the environment will
send it back with your answers

742
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:32,910
%uh but thats I'm still struggling a bit
with there's a lotta math in these

743
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,260
papers there's like you know

744
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,160
one sentence and three page is the math
and then a paragraph so I'm kinda

745
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,730
struggling through a lot of this is like
make my way yessir

746
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:48,730
re: stretching def define near future

747
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,430
on now yeah

748
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,370
what now I'm I actually had something
come up to me it's you know after I talk

749
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,220
to did some stuff with the way

750
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,800
and eyes can you get me encanta get it
or I was like

751
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,380
I ghetto opportunities probably
appropriate things for that but

752
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,740
I'll he said we just don't know what

753
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,800
knew this stuff's really guarded I mean
if if I'm a superpower

754
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,830
and I have the ability to do this now
and affiliates I kinda having the Enigma

755
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,980
machine you know

756
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,330
you don't want everyone know you have it
because then they can try to mitigate

757
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,570
that even if it's just using a sneaker
net or a typewriter

758
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,960
yeah your

759
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,150
I don't think it's theoretically
impossible I think right now the big

760
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,690
issues again are the magnetic fields

761
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,650
and that the cold the environment but
they've already got it like I said

762
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,750
39 minutes at room temperature you know

763
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,460
I'm I'm sure they probably thought the
phone I have in my pocket was pretty

764
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,930
impossible either years ago

765
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:09,630
so but twenty years I'd say no but in
