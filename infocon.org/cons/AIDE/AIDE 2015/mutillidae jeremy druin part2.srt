1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,560
when yep

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,440
hmm ok alright so

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,960
for the this time around gonna talk a
lot about them it sold a tool

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,240
so we just used a recently and

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,000
presentation for the Soucy injection but

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,439
actually has a um a lot more
vulnerability is built into it

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,630
and if I'm not mistaken I think it's up
to an even 50 now

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,340
were this is the home page at all

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,500
or and so the first challenge of course
would be

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,360
installation the way it's designed is is

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,360
you just download all the files

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,760
when those users may prefer the zip file

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,000
that's up on the SourceForge site but it
also has a to get repository

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,090
as well on the SourceForge if you're
using a Linux system

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,090
that's probably quite a bit easier than
dealing with a zip file

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,090
but either way is OK this happens to be

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,090
a.m. am going to system so

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,040
and this case all you do is either
download the files via get

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,860
directly into your web server directory
or

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,610
unzip them into this directory there's
only one folder for the entire project

21
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,750
the men told a folder so if you can get
their folder into the web server

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,700
should be in good shape

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,010
in this case I'm use and the LAMP stack

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,820
installed on a bit into just the the
default version

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,140
that you can get from a bunch a
different sites instructions on how to

26
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,670
do that

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,420
and for Windows 7 IV's

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,049
the Sam

29
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,450
stack which is like the LAMP stack for
Windows

30
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,909
and some other people have a give me
some feedback today per for

31
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,259
though lamp stack for their Windows
installation

32
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,920
multi-link more easy in either case you
install

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,899
the program though the LAMP stack
program and then you

34
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,019
drop this single folder into the
directory

35
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:19,190
appropriate for that installation once
you get it installed

36
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,440
your the homepage UL

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,760
will show but it's going to give you a
warning that

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,200
it's not connect to the database and
there's a reset database but here you

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,290
would click to

40
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,970
cause the database to be built I'm on
that topic

41
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,269
there is a database but will rebuild the
database at any time

42
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:44,709
and essentially adjusts actually dropped
the database and and reconstruction from

43
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:45,400
scratch

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,180
so inundated and they re you would lose
every populates the database with a lot

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
a date on it sound

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,330
but anything custom the United yourself
for me on

47
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,590
and reason I have set up that way is
because a

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,220
sometimes I get into some good across
age groups

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,220
better pretty fun and

50
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,500
you start to realize that just about
every single page you go to is infected

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,530
with the scripts

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,799
or multiple scripts I'm and it starts to
make the site and usable

53
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,049
but just clicking that reset button

54
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,100
you have a back to the factory specs

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,350
I just couple seconds so get started

56
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,880
purse we have the homepage and it has
some

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,120
articles on it better poster just kinda
get you started

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,350
same I want to click on the what should
I do and also to give you a walk there

59
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,650
at the security modes and help me button

60
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,410
the different kinds are hints that
there's an entire paper

61
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,410
published on the tool

62
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,180
in its use and classroom environments
and capture flags and

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,459
other use cases that you can download

64
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,360
and that's also enter on the left

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,810
and then it also links of two the

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,280
YouTube site for the project which is
the your

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,300
weaponized YouTube channel

68
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:12,300
that has a give or take probably 50
videos on webcam testing that most part

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,370
it continues until the day is the
example

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,329
and there's probably another
fifty-years-old videos on just kinda

71
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,169
random

72
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,500
thought something testing some stuff on
and map

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,150
different workshops we'd done with the
ISSA a

74
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,780
across the broad range earth a network
and testing topics that are not

75
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,900
necessarily going to be

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,479
focused on web each a page I wanted his
help me buttons

77
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,990
and so let's go to page that's

78
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,290
kinda interesting like on C I think this
first one is

79
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,130
my interesting I mean that has multiple

80
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,930
vulnerabilities so if we click the home
button

81
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,330
the the system

82
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,700
has a record of what my own abilities
are located on each other pages

83
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,840
so when you click the button depending
on way pager on

84
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,850
it'll tell you who'll what

85
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,320
tie some attacks you should try on that
particular page

86
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,450
now to attack is not listed it doesn't
necessarily mean that the pages

87
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,200
invulnerable

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,789
just means that I don't have a
documented

89
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,539
and so if you find an extra attack on a
page let me know now I did into the

90
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:21,990
system

91
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,440
so this page has around six

92
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,860
or so major things wrong with it and
that you should track

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,210
after not really sure where to start

94
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,680
on a page as far as to start an attack
it's disabled by default

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,810
because can awesome a law knowing but

96
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,660
if you show the pop-up tents and will
happen as as

97
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,060
when you get the mouse close to an area
that has

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,660
the vulnerability el Papa Hannah

99
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,880
that'll tell you about the most obvious
boner ability for that field

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,780
so this still happens to be wonderful to
cross site scripting and some other

101
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,600
things but

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,840
as hero injection is kinda the main
point

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,040
I love this page it's a it's the main a
challenge

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,720
that the pagers bill for and then the
other vulnerabilities or just sat in for

105
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,280
fun

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,090
so if we had the pop up and settle stop

107
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:26,900
popping those up and so it

108
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,790
it made a claim that this page is
vulnerable to SQL injection saying past

109
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,970
are to work here

110
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,090
normal process size the

111
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,190
field with all kinds of different
characters see if you can get an error

112
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,840
to occur eventually when he found around
a single quote you'll see that it causes

113
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,390
an air

114
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,160
now there's are designed to be very
verbose in fact there's a whole class in

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,830
the project that just does nothing but

116
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,490
emblem and as much for da city as is
humanly possible

117
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,980
a to make the on the end

118
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,750
what you're supposed to do next as
obvious as possible so and that way it's

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,990
its kinda not very realistic because
good web applications are suppose

120
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,250
to keep all their information to
themselves and just give you a friendly

121
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,740
message on what action should take next
bud

122
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,650
suppressing how many sites actually
kinda look like this anyways

123
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,180
her and maybe it's not as unrealistic
should be course once you get there to

124
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,830
curtail do things like it'll tell you
the query

125
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,919
that you're supposed to inject it'll
give you the

126
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,890
I'm in some cases the field names at
least a table names

127
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,960
if nothing else here gives you both the
tells you the table as accounts in their

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,710
fields are username and password

129
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,840
at least the fields of interest anyway
and goes on the stack traces in

130
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,290
and other things like that and sum up
the error messages that are in here

131
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,470
may not necessarily be very useful to
you

132
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,600
but they're interesting to certain
scanners and the site is also designed

133
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,440
to be a target for web scanners

134
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,120
so we've used it to test a.m. scanners
from my

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,200
like burp suite to see what I can find

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,220
and some enterprise scanners like a

137
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,180
abscam and

138
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,639
an app scanner which are actually two
different scanners whether it's back

139
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,039
things like that too kind a test out
enterprise-grade scanners to

140
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,219
so that we have a kind of a neutral site
to compare them against

141
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:26,590
now course those scanning companies will
produce site so their own

142
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,060
for you to this to practice on as well
but

143
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,490
on there's a possibility that the sites
may be biased towards those tools

144
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:40,680
it's nice to have a neutral platform so
once you

145
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,050
them let's go and finished exercise once
you figure out

146
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,050
what is your supposed to do and kinda
what to do I think this page takes in a

147
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,769
very

148
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:55,260
traditional cross-site scripting I'm not
mistaken it's just the old you know like

149
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,779
single clone or something cool something

150
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,940
comment field one ok to think I did

151
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:08,940
I didn't put the comment in there yep

152
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,630
Ste Chinese something that's I am for
shorter

153
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,899
so like here have just picked a two
eagles to

154
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,170
I do not

155
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,420
want to pass her okay are you

156
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,300
and so you can work your way through the
exercise and then

157
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,510
we ventured into conclusion where SQL
injection dumps out that account stable

158
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,070
and you can

159
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,240
see that there's other problems like the
passwords are not hash in

160
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,240
and go from there cool there is a login
page on the site

161
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,920
and main point login page at other than

162
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,300
to login is to give me the option to

163
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,570
to look at some authentication and some
authors asian problems

164
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,890
so the page itself is vulnerable to

165
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,850
process scripting SQL injection as well
some more traditional tax

166
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,910
but not a stir on section to dump
database information but till I to

167
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,690
bypass authentication via

168
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,440
SQL injection so he may get to a page in

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,040
even with the help me button and adding
exactly sure what to do or even if

170
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,449
you're sure to do your not really

171
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,540
positive on how to do it there's a
built-in tutorial system

172
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,899
and that's activated by clicking on
toggle hence

173
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,350
and kinda like to help me button are

174
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,339
the each page has

175
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,860
a record basically a what's wrong with
it and so i think there's around

176
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,970
maybe 45 tutorials that are built into
the system

177
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,080
give or take but only in the ones

178
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,860
that are valid for that particular page
will actually load

179
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,920
and its dynamic so as you go from page
to page then hence bars going to reload

180
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,399
with the

181
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,810
articles I would be %uh ventures to you
on that particular page so for example

182
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,820
if we click on the

183
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,279
a HTML injection hence that

184
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,760
tutorials are broken down more or less
into Canova

185
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,140
summary have what the problem is and
then

186
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,990
give you send clues on how you would
discover that so high if you did

187
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,510
purchase this page bond how would you
have gone about figuring out

188
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,620
that this page had an HTML injection
vulnerability

189
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,320
then across against everyone's favorite
part exploitation

190
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,550
and it'll give you a working example
oven

191
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,550
other exploitation at work and then

192
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,980
finally is going to talk about something
specific to that attack

193
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,399
and give me some examples that you can
try

194
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,790
and and often at all talk about

195
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,920
a the defense itself at the bottom and
this case a small injection is

196
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,970
easily defended with output encoding so
there's not a whole lot say

197
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,380
but more thing you'll notice is that

198
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,459
there's a video section at the bottom
above the tutorials

199
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,779
and if the site

200
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,440
can reach you too it does have a square
kurland

201
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,990
tries to go out to YouTube to see if
they can get a video or not if it's

202
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,770
successful

203
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,610
it'll embed the video itself right here
in to the page for you can just click

204
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,360
play and watch the video on spot

205
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,640
if you cannot reach the network like in
this case we're running this virtual

206
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,240
machine

207
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,250
isolated I'm to go ahead and that a link

208
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,329
to the site that you can click or you
can copy it

209
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,670
if you're like this where iron

210
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,779
offline so let's see

211
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,089
copy link and then

212
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:54,089
I think I'm connect to the Internet over
here maybe maybe not

213
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,280
up area so anyway it'll take you over to
the

214
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,760
video in this one talks about
introduction HTML injection

215
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,350
and and so on well by the way this is
the

216
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,940
this is the YouTube channel a that has
all these videos

217
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,960
so there are

218
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,680
a few on Fisher ka playlists here on the
left

219
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,830
so the web application videos are mainly
in this

220
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,300
web application to invest in playlist
and there's also ones on building a

221
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,920
pentose lab for yourself

222
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,200
that goes be on web and then we have
some videos on Burke sweet and map

223
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,990
as well the MF ones are mainly a
workshop we had a couple years ago

224
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,290
a Adrian myself and

225
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,740
Martin boss who talked about to

226
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,170
and Matt for a day in an aging was nice
enough to record of so

227
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,490
fear Arison other topics my check that
out as well and so

228
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:06,490
say let's go and try hansens were in
here

229
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,430
so it may run into

230
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,540
problems like for the field isn't

231
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,820
big enough and these a

232
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,570
this is not a mistake you're supposed to
solve these challenges you go through so

233
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,430
if you try to pay something into a field
in the fields not big enough for two

234
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,649
fields disabled

235
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,990
or the sales hit and perhaps some other
fields are actually hidden

236
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,660
like the hence themselves had in level 5
so you had to figure out a way to rename

237
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:37,990
on

238
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,649
these are all puzzles that are built
into the into the tool

239
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,620
so you can go through her and try to
figure out some way to

240
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,190
you know the fix it so to speak and so I
think this one we would want to

241
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,180
figure out what the problem is that
field looks like the max length this

242
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,220
only 20 so you know change it to

243
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,620
man and that are just obliterate the max
like that to be altogether

244
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:09,120
whatever you want to do make feel bigger

245
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,520
alright and then you go

246
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,150
work there and try your injections and
see if you can get in the work so

247
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,810
looks like the sites done a pretty good
job defending itself in this case

248
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:32,810
right

249
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,389
France security levels right now

250
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,819
its I and security level 0 which is

251
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:44,619
pretty weak it's not completely and
totally defenseless

252
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:49,179
but the defenses are going to be clients
at controls and things like that that

253
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:52,860
were not the same there and say they are
uncommon necessarily but

254
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,389
they can be circumvented for sure
there's absolutely no way the sites

255
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,189
gonna stop you

256
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:02,249
I'm if you're determined enough to go
ahead and any reason a reception proxy

257
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:04,819
like Mark sweet where you don't have to
use the browser at all

258
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,920
or if you just change the HTML around a
little bit

259
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,570
to see your needs so if I go

260
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,380
wants to secure level 1 it's still gonna
be

261
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,850
completely Bob at by passable but

262
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,790
there's probably going to be some extra
client side validation cited and

263
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,980
typically what it does is there's gonna
be JavaScript validation

264
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,660
on a lot of the pages a lot of arms

265
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,470
and the jobs for validation is gonna do
blacklist filtering so it's gonna look

266
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,860
for certain characters

267
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,870
to prevent you from entering an and
course it's trivial to defeat that you

268
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,230
can simply disable the Java scripting to
rewrite it

269
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,540
for that matter because it's running in
your browser so you have complete access

270
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,220
to

271
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,770
and then there's a security level 5

272
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,170
it does skip to three and four for kinda
future expansion if you will

273
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,940
and in theory scary level 5 a supposed
to be secure

274
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,940
if you find a more billions and lo fi
VIN people have

275
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,100
I am the idea is to let me know about it
so I can fix it

276
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,850
and try to make it scare as we we want
scary level 52

277
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,370
to work correctly not not working
correctly

278
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,750
so sometimes it's easier to make the
site secure than it is to actually put

279
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,610
all these challenges in the making and
secure

280
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,920
kinda funny when you start to try to
make the site hackable it actually

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,570
breaks it

282
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,850
more easily so as Colonel 5 give it your
best shot so I care I think we have

283
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,030
typed in a single quote earlier

284
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,150
and the JavaScript validation is kicking
in and even if you disable that

285
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,320
a some server side validation set kick
in as well

286
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,320
so let's see if we can find that
JavaScript validation

287
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,790
helps now

288
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,559
may try

289
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:17,559
the for know there is that Scott

290
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,260
a javascript function on sum it up login
form

291
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,000
so you have to go change that Javascript
or do something like return true here

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,940
or whatever disturbing just together the
validation

293
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,330
and even then

294
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,850
I'm even if you remove all the
client-side filters scale 5s

295
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,640
supposed to be scared to say has server
side effects that make sense

296
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,470
we had a day I'm and enforce

297
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,050
SSL button this causes the project to

298
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,850
at least in theory only serve over HTTPS

299
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,750
and that was put in there to you offer
up the

300
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,550
SSL strip challenge where you want see
the

301
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,750
machine in the middle the site and the
server are the browser on the server

302
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,990
and then you'll use H a.m. SSL strip

303
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,510
to remove the SSL protection from the
site

304
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,080
even though its enforce SS um no so that
makes for some pretty good demos

305
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,750
and that's kinda fun to do to nail a
challenge

306
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,980
also added analog a lot of the stuff you
do on the various pages throughout the

307
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,540
site

308
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,860
its gonna write that information down to
the law and the idea here is is that

309
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,600
you wanna try to figure out what
information gets locked

310
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,770
and so various things you type into
certain fields are forms across the site

311
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,660
are gonna end up over here in the lobby
so you do the

312
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,220
normal reconnaissance a scanning
activity

313
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,840
are you in make up a random number are
you know put enough

314
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,890
a phrase that mean something to you and

315
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,700
you know put that into several different
fields and then come over here to the

316
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,040
login page in CF

317
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,310
air injection shows up or not 16 that
found a field that ends up in the log

318
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,940
then you would want to write a
cross-site scripting try to infect the

319
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,740
administrator who would come over here
and look at the log and so it's kinda

320
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,390
capture the flag type exercise you can
delete logs when she in fact them

321
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,460
cuz does get annoying every time you
visited you know

322
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:28,340
cross-site scripting or even just reset
the database and then the last button on

323
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,900
the main

324
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,810
menu bar is a captured data page

325
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,270
what why things I wanted to do was build
an

326
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,670
some kind of capturing mechanism that

327
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,900
on if you could just get someone to
visit

328
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,480
this page it would write down the

329
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,920
information that was sent so things like
the URL

330
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,520
any cookies on much course is the main
thing you wanna try to steal and

331
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,800
and this exercise anyway and any post
parameters and and other information

332
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,650
from the browser

333
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,640
and the reason was that I am and then
test and stuffs

334
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,530
I am sometimes it's kinda nice just to
have a real quick page you can fire up

335
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,740
that if you can just somehow convince
people to come over there and visit that

336
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,400
will capture all that information

337
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,790
so if you visit the capture data page

338
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,390
without the D cool then it'll %uh

339
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,870
it'll show you what got captured and in
this case it's couple cookies and some

340
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,690
parameters you can go back to the view
capture data page that we're just on

341
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,530
and you'll see that it gets logged in
there for you and

342
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,300
these pages are even vulnerable
themselves at least until you go to

343
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,940
scary level 5 so you can have some fun
with

344
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,870
with that as well ok

345
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,940
were out-tough and the the
vulnerabilities

346
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,419
about her name you can use the menus on
the left so

347
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,190
have an organized by they lost top 10
have this year

348
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,830
20 a which the 2013 version goes through
2016 so this menu will be good until

349
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,169
next year in theory

350
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,720
assuming a loss but puts out the the
2016 list

351
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,880
and it's got

352
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,940
basically ten categories cuz so lost top
10 then within each category

353
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,029
so say we got on a cross-site scripting
there be the different types so that my

354
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,659
own ability

355
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,450
so for cross-site scripting for example
we have reflect a persistent Dom

356
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,700
the a different kinds a HTTP attributes

357
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,960
a shame of of storage Jason injection
and cookie injection

358
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,100
XML injection and then course we just
talked about the

359
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,850
path relative Style Sheets earlier and I
have also added in

360
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,000
some cross I scripts that work very well
with the framework

361
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,350
because that's a a super funds or play
with for

362
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,690
cross-site scripting and I'm so these
pages all

363
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,080
guarantee that they've got some process
group that played very friendly

364
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,080
what that tall and be talks

365
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,960
these these older men use here

366
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,340
are the differences between

367
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,620
the current oh I stopped and and that a
lost top 10 from that year so

368
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,630
in 2010 there is a few things that fell
off the list if it

369
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,230
as it were and didn't make it into the
2013 so I leave just the differences

370
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,809
behind

371
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,350
and have done the same for 2007
historically you can go back and look at

372
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,360
some of those

373
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,870
vulnerabilities are still exist today
it's just that they're not

374
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,970
relevant enough to make it into the top
10 list anymore certainly

375
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,260
there's a whole lot more web owner
delays in just 10 a las just list attend

376
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,470
their most impactful

377
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,870
and that three year period and then the
web services have been added as well

378
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,950
originally I just sat in a soap
webservice

379
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,110
and then actually expanded out to have
command injection as hero injection and

380
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,299
username and duration

381
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:58,350
and does web services added the username
and immigration after an

382
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,830
talkin with TEM towns little and he was
explained that he

383
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,150
had written some scripts that he used
and his classes

384
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,620
and thought to be just add a man here
kinda had one stop shopping

385
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,299
eventually read some RESTful services as
well and you can do SQL injection and

386
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,000
username mean

387
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,340
generation via these rest services so

388
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,980
there's a test page for those as well
I'm

389
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,990
and it'll give you the West or for the
so Bay services

390
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,010
so that you can load that into your
favor to allow people like to use soap

391
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,520
UI

392
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,440
or some other different roles in they
kinda nato was told to get that process

393
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,929
going

394
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:39,070
so to make it as easy as possible party
at all that and

395
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,270
and then there's also some

396
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,570
a attacks that can I don't really fit
into

397
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,600
lost top 10 great I they can to fit in
there somewhere

398
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,669
but out but a few of those down here the
bottom html5 gets its own section

399
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:55,520
because it's

400
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,710
just really kinda you need right now
right

401
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,240
provides high on that especially the
chase on the Ajax stuff

402
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,419
and then I'm there are some items that
had the bottom the maybe just kinda

403
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:08,919
didn't fit for a while

404
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,940
so you know then restricted file a blood
was a

405
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,279
request I got from someone now for the I
think that is sent to an email and

406
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,220
on them on the support request and said
hey can you had this thing and

407
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,789
and so ta sat in there I a la step down
with XML

408
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:30,230
and and then based off other talk that

409
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,639
on agent had done added and local and
remote file inclusion vulnerabilities

410
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:35,620
into some pages

411
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,809
and also explain in those pages how to
setup your

412
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:42,909
server to make sure that it's actually
gonna pull

413
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,519
because a there's out there certain
conditions that have to be

414
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,429
you know Mets in order to get their
remote I'm

415
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:54,570
follow injection to work and then of
course

416
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,449
filing down to bottom there's a lot of
documentation keep the change log on

417
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:03,279
a but the installation instructions
probably have

418
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,219
I most interest and then a listing a
boner abilities

419
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:11,119
and so these are the current on
abilities that are in the system

420
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,029
and when head and broken down by page

421
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,409
so that you could search for a
vulnerability that you want to try

422
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:23,979
and then use this list to know what
pages are supposed to go to

423
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:27,549
and order to you to find that on our
building

424
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:30,749
it it's not kept

425
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:34,119
quite as up to date as I would like so
it is something I can do in my spare

426
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,779
time

427
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:37,819
but I usually updated about three or
four times a year

428
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:40,879
and I'll kinda fiercely at in a few
things and push a couple different

429
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:41,519
versions

430
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,729
I many may not hear matter from me for a
few months

431
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,389
I'm like Oh tackle some other project or
but a

432
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:52,899
ladue push new changes I'll post them to
their weapon AZT

433
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:56,229
Twitter so it's the same spelling as the
YouTube channel

434
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:59,289
and there's a link actually embedded
into the project here

435
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:02,819
and then the video tutorials just goes
after the same tutorials that we already

436
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:03,429
saw

437
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,249
so there some resources that are happy
out by death

438
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:11,190
I tried as much as possible on the main
topics to make sure

439
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,279
that the tutorials cover all of the main
topics that ur

440
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,309
used and the classrooms

441
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,469
so a couple schools that i no other
reason this

442
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:28,149
I'm I know there's one in Germany at
apologize camera the name I'm not sure

443
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,749
if I could pronounce even if I did

444
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:33,139
but a they may on Saturday the stalls
gray we use it

445
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:36,889
I know University lawful uses it and

446
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,539
sold in university and a couple other
schools and

447
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:45,179
around this area and so tried hard to
make sure that the tutorials for

448
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,509
those items that are in the you know
typically covered in a class

449
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,119
definitely have really good help and I'm
now those

450
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:57,150
if that helps wasn't enough if you hit
the toggle hands but twice

451
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,620
a and I'll maybe I shouldn't tell you
this cursor professors in the rain but

452
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,370
I am it basically tells you exactly what
to do

453
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,390
it literally just says you know copy
this copy this copy this

454
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,400
and you'll get your SQL injection to
work in nineteen have to really think

455
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,310
about it too much

456
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,100
but the idea what these advanced
tutorials: they're only there for

457
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,120
cross-site scripting SQL injection
cross-site request forgery cuz those are

458
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,680
really the big three that are covered in
classes

459
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,460
and course are some other ones that
might be covered as well but those are

460
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,000
the main

461
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,090
ones that are vice on pretty well you
know

462
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,850
references it'll go down into great
detail about the different kinds

463
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,960
a maven show you how to use some tools
to make the job easier

464
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,440
so I believe on this one has a huge
section reconnaissance and scanning and

465
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,530
I wanna say it even

466
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,640
breaks down how to get out the
information scheme and wash it there

467
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,720
I basically the entire and testing
process per

468
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,570
for that that vulnerability again only
in there for

469
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,570
you know the main three or four phone
abilities but

470
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,310
those advanced tutorials might be Sun
News

471
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,940
and that's pretty good over here

472
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,190
I've the project and its free so feel
free downloadable

473
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,310
and use it Harry C said or

474
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,690
it's running local host at least it
should be I'm

475
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,590
hoping no one Asus on the Internet so if
they do thats

476
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,020
could be inviting some some problems but
since it is running local host

477
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,520
here title a tack attacking yourself so
it's legal

478
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,600
and safe to use you can always reset it
if you need to

479
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,740
if you on if you did have an idea to
host it

480
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,970
where others can get to it you know cuz
you're having a

481
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,610
capture the flag event or something like
that I one important note

482
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,810
is the the system is actually vulnerable

483
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,150
so a lot of the systems

484
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,160
the way they work is they

485
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,130
look for you to type in a certain phrase

486
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,780
or a certain pattern and if the pattern
is what you're looking for then they say

487
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,400
oh okay what you did a cross-ice reading
correctly and here's your token

488
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,030
and but they're not actually vulnerable
they're just looking for to see

489
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,850
that you type in what they expect on
this subsystem really does have these

490
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,070
are really is and they're so

491
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,190
you would not want ousted you know

492
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,270
on a your computer or hosted where it's
remotely assessable

493
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,680
because it very easily could result in
complete compromise

494
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,570
have the entire system it does have
command injection vulnerabilities and

495
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,300
some other things like that built into
it

496
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,570
and that would allow compress the box

497
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,580
so just a little more caution there but
otherwise

498
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,840
certainly welcome to use it certain
questions

499
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,880
or he

500
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,470
okay up

501
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:03,690
year I'll

502
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,610
dancing

503
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:15,610
no you

504
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,010
that yeah

505
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:26,010
your

506
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,770
net version that Sen Metasploit a boy is
the version that was out

507
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,780
I am basically on the day that that was
created

508
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,890
and it may not even have the videos in
any way

509
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,040
so i think thats a I wanna say it around
my version 2.4 something like that

510
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,890
the the operating system of

511
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:57,830
found that's just the easiest of all if
you want to set up your own lawn stack

512
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,950
is a vented

513
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,570
works great on that and the LAMP stack
up

514
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,580
pretty easy to install on Ubuntu and

515
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,960
course there's other operating systems
that work just fine I'm but that what

516
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,100
seems to be the most well-known I guess
that

517
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,350
was completely easy and there was no
problems with the site up and no

518
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,210
dependency issues on if you would like

519
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,799
a distribution where is already
installed but has a

520
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,020
much later version may trade Samrat

521
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,840
on my testing framework it has

522
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:37,040
version to 610 I believe in it and i
wanna say that a new version of Sam rise

523
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,309
coming out here

524
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:42,250
maybe just couple weeks or so like very
soon I think 311 is coming out

525
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,429
on take a look at that added a couple
weeks ago

526
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,710
and it looks really nice spaced on

527
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,150
I'm commitment to your average say that
I'm

528
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,770
and it was relatively easy to take

529
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,710
the new version until a day and updated
to and

530
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,660
the latest I went ahead and actually
made a youtube video on how to do that

531
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,020
just for Sarah so when it comes out

532
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,660
humility install it really easily all

533
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:16,290
and just replace the existing merger so
I say about Sam rises that its it has

534
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,290
all the attack tools built into it

535
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,790
whereas on first met spoils a great as a
remote target

536
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,500
because it has all the marble services
are not so it's just awesome

537
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,720
okay me and

538
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,720
yeah

539
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,030
well certainly callous the standard
distribution at our work

540
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,970
its matter fact is the only one we use
period

541
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,290
has its in our opinion this the best one
to use

542
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,550
Coursera has an opinion that I mean
that's just what we GNE

543
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,810
we decide for ourselves and that's the
best once I think that's a great way to

544
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,230
do it

545
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,260
is to use Kali hurt

546
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,429
it's pretty fun

547
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,330
order very well thank you very much
