1
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:07,419
audio levels look pretty good

2
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,769
and from a walk a bit backtrack

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,570
trying to type

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,850
hope

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,320
lol body I'm back again

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,939
this is the talk has exposed to get
descriptions a little bit of

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,179
I actually a free hour class why teach
people um how to use various docking at

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,719
how to get around on and so forth

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,850
by its way to pick a topic to cover and
on something like this

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,969
but I'm basically doing a rehash have a
talking to a couple years ago

11
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:45,950
with a few updates up we'll go over some
the dotnet throughout their someone's

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,800
you can check out

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,140
someone references you know what they
are and

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,160
well here we go love about me well had

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,840
forgiveness talk once before so on the
spot to talk before

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,190
I'm Inc which I when I need to calm im
sick education stuff

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,790
don't know anything stuff especially
comes from the dock at thanks because a

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,229
certain

19
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,130
spots where the eye on encryption
protocols and how things appear together

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,750
gets complicated real fast I am I'm also
seeing information security consultant a

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,900
trusted sec

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,600
that lock I think this giving me fits
for a while

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,100
anyway I and cofounder of Debbie CAI ago
which country byway

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,460
agee underscore ATC okay

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,610
I me talking from two perspectives
disposed of that's a concern people

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,650
trying to stay anonymous

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,689
and also a little bit about how people
tried the anonymized up

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,600
spilled I'm not really a privacy guy I
will these guys like to say

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,829
if I could know everything for everyone
I would

30
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,350
i'd have a distrust the people in
general I suppose a full

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,070
ASI that love people who have a lot of
power

32
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,820
get away with things they wanted people
knew what they were up to

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,270
however that being said having power or
or

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,429
gives you how having power allows you to
buy more privacy

35
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,520
is that way putting that but I'm not
really up a huge privacy

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,630
%uh enthusiast I dislike crypto and

37
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,959
networking and all that's left my
interest in dotnet also I'm not a lawyer

38
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,959
but some things you can do are a doc
nets

39
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,250
you now be yeah I careful where you go

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,379
technically he usually some cuts
contraband

41
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,510
arm strict liability meee if you

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,160
if you get a look at contraband on your
hard drive doesn't matter that you're

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,950
doing research

44
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,950
you got it just up I got a man into
legal trouble if it's found

45
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,989
so if you see something called a Chan

46
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,079
on dotnet reply want to avoid it
anything that says lally

47
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,610
keep I want to avoid it anything that
has a little bear dancing around

48
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,750
one avoided any references to Julie
Burkhart tight

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,440
Junie B share all captain picard you
want to avoid that too last night and

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
all that late on I can

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
I can give you T up be careful you surf

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,880
like that contraband awaits i nuovi such
a want to is looking round of nets

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,329
and he found a paper who actually got
picture himself there

54
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,389
because he just we know paper how did
the on on my son type dotnet

55
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,940
so his picture was there a tells me the
spec child porn here

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,269
the you do jimmy circuits yeah

57
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,420
easy to get contraband you don't want on
your machine soap Disgaea that

58
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,060
global warning look the background how
would you define your docking at is

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,299
essentially a doc net

60
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,269
yes a private not my thing network

61
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,400
at the network tries to make it so that
you don't know who's serving something

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,609
or you don't know who is accessing
something

63
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,980
there's a couple other different uses at
the time doc net for instance I think

64
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,269
when the

65
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,060
earliest which will use is worth unused
IP space or actually IP space

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,030
you could get a message to because the
routing we come back

67
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,280
so cock a black hole that is the early
days of a net

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,120
addenda 10 also can't give it to be used
for IP space that you own

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,390
but you set aside MCI Michael using the
actual service in here

70
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,549
so the by tries to beat those I P
addresses we know it has to be a

71
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,420
legitimate traffic

72
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,210
that's not his docket but that doesn't
mean I mean is just

73
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,920
what time fight for space that to me is
less

74
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,600
and biggest and dotnet just happy we use
terms like Deep Web this is doc net

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,650
and the terminology gets a little messy
using deep web is

76
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,720
anything that's not service web anything
that is not select indexed by Google

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,460
or something behind a paywall a behind a
password talk savage a cat

78
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,030
some is not easily serviced role via
Google

79
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,340
all a similar search engine would be
about definition uva

80
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,870
a deep web and that way

81
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,980
sometimes toys name Deep Web with all
such engines for it

82
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,090
anyway I liked some cyberspace know that
we had caught on

83
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,510
be I so it's okay but these documents ap
Privacy enthusiasts who worry about

84
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,270
censorship

85
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,230
would be one firms word about up policy
compliance and Lee

86
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,190
data also sometimes be interested in
step with keeping up with competitors as

87
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,950
a start talking too high a bike I

88
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,790
we talk about using toy 2 I'm
investigator

89
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,979
competitors without them knowing where
you're coming from the notes in

90
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,060
investigating presence if target sees
people from Walmart IP space

91
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,729
checking them out they know something's
up using tor

92
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,310
they hope they don't know that %uh law
enforcement also cuz

93
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,080
what I think most people aren't these
dotnet a crypto innings like mean just

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,780
enjoy it

95
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,680
on dollar-some CDI elements

96
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,270
what so for ever since don't just might
be

97
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,550
well peer to peer I now granted still

98
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,070
to come pick up my material still
illegal but on

99
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,880
hey you not nearly as likely be busted
for copyright infringement

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,070
if you're using one of these networks
also

101
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,960
censorship issues you can publish
something I have a tight back to you all

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,070
and so you can actually get a message
out without it being tied back to you

103
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,160
privacy in general if your stuff around
the web 31 is doc nets

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
you can keep least most information
about you from going out there

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,460
does some precautions remade and Franks
talk we mention a few phone threats and

106
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,780
if you using tor don't I configured all
yourself

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,620
if all you're doing is surfing use the
toll browser bundle or something better

108
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,420
yet like tails

109
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,510
I tales actually can I still be shut it
down it also tries the right memory

110
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,400
either um have you ever her the Colbert
attack

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,350
it but some you have but I went gold
what is cobra attack since a is

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,590
into its been pulling chignon memory

113
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,700
your computer has a little bit of life
span before Tony dots

114
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,190
so the Cobra attack the system has a
machine locked well

115
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,690
pass within such a still up in memory so
couldn't the tactile

116
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,150
hope to stop the laptop data am spray it
down to get cold

117
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,140
pull it out put and device and the copy
all the memory of it

118
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,940
in that brief not hot that's one reason
is that on things like tails

119
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,350
whites minutemen we we shut down
properly also just learning some is dot

120
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,040
that's actually

121
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,730
well someone's gonna be out almost
purely for educational purposes

122
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,750
to learn about IP routing without
without on

123
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,780
what happened with a major corporation
corporations like a like I said before

124
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,190
see what rates it was really doubt they
are the other is pace been like sites

125
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,370
in doc nets also to a person I've

126
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,650
then for information someone might have
a complete 0

127
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,160
law enforcement like exhaust some
criminal groups out there they all

128
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
family some terrorist group that that
does of mean fair number pedals out

129
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
there as well

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,230
so first got him talk a little bit about

131
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,410
is a not a net and DN forty-two

132
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,410
and ponies together cuz I use to connect
on on that

133
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,780
and I it has hearings with the in
forty-two

134
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,700
so you can access both which one feels
troop I

135
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,470
what what is is a non that I

136
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,930
and they've taken what and our site also
Rd and 42

137
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,550
the ticket IPSS sets done on only rival
internet

138
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,580
now I'm not that took won something
something something

139
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,500
1/28 that since been aside but when they
first %uh do the it it was in the side

140
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,680
but that's what they use ot as not to
conflict with much anything on the

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,180
internet

142
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,510
and you set up pairings and VPN tunnels
to each other

143
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,470
you can actually set your own BGP router
and bakes they have your

144
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,700
overlay network %uh in that on a cup
internet to you a lot about BGP routing

145
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,180
protocols

146
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,060
that's one of things that these kind it
works great for and actually deion 42

147
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,080
is on very much geared towards that it
was a different IP space

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,849
but on this appearance between the two
so to access the nine at

149
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,270
you can get on deion forty-two

150
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,469
as what hacker space in such also hooked
up over this

151
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,540
because your line that kinda layover
outing I mean initial working with them

152
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,290
big network gear oh yeah the mound lot
IP space upon having a chat have that

153
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,250
kind of experience

154
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,470
and most jobs but here you can use it as
a virtual lab

155
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,970
for now

156
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,520
at most about housing internal services
but you also can get out to the public

157
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,010
Internet to all out proxies

158
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,220
so you could use it fun announces
serving the public web as well

159
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,970
are you gonna do it by configure Open
VPN

160
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,779
on latex I accepted the Stetson Kyle X
it's super simple

161
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,200
those he's install notes out there but
the simple thing you do is

162
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,550
at get install Open VPN into doing W get

163
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,990
the VPN settings this byways just be a
client if you wanna Sep a full-time pay

164
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,370
a

165
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,279
that's a little bit more effort but they
have information on the website or not

166
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,650
to

167
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,870
then you can open VPN points config file

168
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,910
and now you can access all these

169
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,740
won something something something that
works and 172 networks that on on on

170
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,000
that

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,500
n the m42 this is a old old image

172
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,820
up how they had things peered at one
time i'd this 17 years old

173
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,060
I believe it's a much much more complex
right now because more people have

174
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,770
joined up

175
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,170
I what time we actually tried to in map
a

176
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,589
all the non that came over interesting
little on shot

177
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,040
love how thanks trace routed through a
lot during

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,400
updated this still I tried to update
recently I had networking issues going

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,050
into work

180
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,079
Alex coffin question the fence put this
one together for me up

181
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,530
those something to see on-air like the
CGI proxy dot

182
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,600
post yes I dot 800 and that may or may
not be down to try to visit a little bit

183
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,060
ago

184
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,470
and yep that's right now it's down

185
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,190
basically the public out proxy but you
get on the public Internet with

186
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,550
and Missy looks like my connection

187
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,580
I don't say my connections

188
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,510
dropped so was at

189
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:54,510
gonna does not connect

190
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,380
you do that outbound public approx you
can use the exit

191
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,470
the public Internet I am well I got this
most often on that

192
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,760
like this web page is a wiki but they
host the shipments of 2 I'm

193
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,560
other services go out there information
how to setup

194
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,140
BGP routing and all that and tons more
tips

195
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,570
I have records

196
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,770
such information for this is a good
search engine for Guardian forty-two doe

197
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,500
can see that the in forty-two we can go
and such wells available

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,950
they also list the internal services on
this particular site

199
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,060
and you can find things like IRC service
we did check

200
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,080
announce the people not

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,360
this no cuz race pros and cons pros are
it's fast I mean basically it's overlay

202
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,710
using open BP and its like BP an anti a
home network

203
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,690
the Denby be in the mail home that we've
gotten someone else's its it actually is

204
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,810
relatively fast and just like any IP
based protocol to be flown over

205
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,700
the cons to add however of the peers can
happen know each other because how to

206
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,530
set up a routing

207
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,610
so it's not as anonymous it's not like
the particle itself

208
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,810
I mean your VPN tunnels coming cryptid
but the people you're passing through

209
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,590
its hot

210
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,940
similar traffic is encoded by something
else in the middle

211
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,770
Smith I like using HTTPS or not people
would be able to take a look at it

212
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,810
also is na services out there and
services drop N Out existence

213
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,580
but that's premature followed up that
someone will host the webpage for

214
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,600
few months then disappears or maybe a
few years now and this goes way you

215
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,510
never know what happened

216
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,870
what is the traffic look like but gently

217
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,290
choosing a and I think I have a tape
adapter having the sport I

218
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,610
5555 TCP and 55

219
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,030
50 TCP though this may have changed
sometimes 422

220
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,660
up with this we have opening a VPN
clients and servers are configured to

221
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,530
use so

222
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,810
those the ones I've seen in the past
them being used

223
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,340
on a similar networks like up

224
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,170
dotnet conglomeration thus far as I can
tell this one may have got away

225
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,840
the a net chaos a VPN as other people
who have AC done this

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,420
will all appear to give a via VPN San
experiment with a

227
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,430
networking but but

228
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,360
that's a good note to go out and learn
on house post Dennis free.net

229
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,210
I'm 3.net and I like this croat it can
makes me think about how free net and

230
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,870
some toys and I to pee

231
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,030
I like networks at work all the world to
be you and me

232
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,780
press without enemies when they catch
you they will kill you but first they

233
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,550
must catch you

234
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,660
worship down his book about a.m. SC

235
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,120
bore cya boa graphics apply technology

236
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,220
anyway I think if we neck I think it at

237
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,120
croat not sure that's why they chose the
rabbit logo but if we not project

238
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I was starving in clock it some

239
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,540
I'll give you the definition why credit
free notice free software which lets you

240
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,970
announce the share files

241
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,709
browsing published free sites is a
website only accessible for free net

242
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,500
and chat on forms about beer censorship
base in a way it works is

243
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,850
you have documents you can inject in the
free net and

244
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,519
its always like a strip is almost looks
like a network in like a distributed on

245
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,550
distributed storage system

246
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,269
at how I love it is you have a local
proxy

247
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:20,389
that you use to interact with it you
actual results accessing your local host

248
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:21,089
but jury

249
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:27,360
requesting documents injecting documents
out there solvers give you example of

250
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,870
that

251
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,959
you see like here yes a document know
someone local host

252
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,259
this a particular document I've
requested

253
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,759
long name there

254
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,800
and this is this is a document has links
of two other documents

255
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,540
the way free networks is you inject
document

256
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,870
into the network it spread out amongst
up a host in a quick the form

257
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,149
something some called meeting saying
that even if you have a contraband

258
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:54,810
machine

259
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,779
while you're storing poor the file USA
know with in the file

260
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:02,079
yeah that some bad stuff out there as
well I

261
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,509
but you inject something out there
biggest distributed amongst the

262
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,100
the clients and you can disconnect
network and %uh some

263
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,329
I there is

264
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,920
somehow be done see in there so

265
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,149
let's say you talk to set out there it
spread out there we try to request the

266
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:19,800
file

267
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,980
it gets passed back to you each hop
along the way well

268
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,360
I got a picture for that that's a

269
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,689
up a request something out there's a hot
cup for how many hot so go before it

270
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:31,459
doesn't find it

271
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:36,129
well you go up to the network and hope
it goes all in the connections between

272
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,459
people in quotes a small-world model

273
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,699
way up a path of note note you have this

274
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,339
oh you don't

275
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:45,779
james hot count gone the next know till

276
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,470
find stuff and then that gets we turned
back for the network

277
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,339
two-person and he spotted return through
caches

278
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,850
that particular bettah data that way

279
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,879
summits request the whole lot gets more
redundancy

280
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,069
stuff can't slowly but surely disappear
out free.net

281
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:06,220
if it's not ever is not requesting more
if no one

282
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,889
request on for a very long time
eventually pine and notes will have it

283
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,249
but here you see the ad

284
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:16,559
the outbound path take several of the
people who didn't have it

285
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,230
that fight on someone who did have it
then goes back

286
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,439
to measure requester and all notes on
the way

287
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:28,319
make a cached copy what looks like

288
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:32,739
like I said before use have a a browser
point the local host

289
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:38,699
port 8 8 8 and you can check out couple
and excites you can take your

290
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,999
key and give to people so they can
download stuff and a soda

291
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,899
types the keys out there by his example
where you I would look like

292
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:51,189
this'll all US K I think that my
actually the 1i por up in the Browse a

293
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:52,100
bit ago

294
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,939
the chk content has keys these keys the
static content

295
00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:59,949
and the key is a hash the concept help
me find it

296
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:04,860
on your distributed hash tables I would
it was a couple good

297
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,409
image to describe how distributed hash
tables work but essentially

298
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,919
some ppl networking site some peer to
peer file sharing software also uses

299
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,309
that like if you ever used on

300
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:19,130
I track a list a bit what

301
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,319
you looking west a distributed hash
table

302
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,589
basically you go okay why has today to

303
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,049
this is my hash this hash is closest to
this person's identifiable

304
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,590
grocery store information about the hash
I give to them a gift to a few others

305
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,929
and similar nature so this redundancy
also if someone

306
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,179
chance which is basic when people come
on today of it

307
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:45,470
then I have input costs like okay I'm no
longer go take a ti skis these hashes

308
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:45,760
you

309
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,870
passion on someone else but this is the
way I love hands distributed database

310
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,390
throughout the network was no single
point a failure

311
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,870
that's the core idea net the Clyde also
between toys on

312
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,260
a tracklist system

313
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,140
so you'll have to have a single says
that the parfait with people can take

314
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,030
that out and then

315
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,340
the networks busted first SKS us

316
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,990
SK sign some states keys used to sites
that

317
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,290
could change overtime it assigns but
publisher the content

318
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,460
likely supersede see the body I US case

319
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,860
so basically if your doc maybe what the
change over time it doesn't have to be a

320
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,400
static document that's out there

321
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,630
I US K

322
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,410
updatable subspace keys willing to spend
the wrappers for SS case the handle

323
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,110
visions a

324
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,610
a document and KSK ski Woodside keys
easy remember because

325
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,910
up simple keys like well K

326
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,040
SK my text but on

327
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,480
they can be the name collisions the
payoff was injecting what at wanna posit

328
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,890
naming it give us the No

329
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,200
who's actually been 20 docking in sight
the

330
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,890
your oils ugly right doesn't have a
problem between

331
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,970
having convenient names you can type in
having something secure because

332
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,570
yet to give you trust somebody up

333
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,970
you have a simple thing like antiques
that i2p this the way I TP does it but

334
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,250
you have to trust the people

335
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,049
you requesting that name from to give
USA and public Internet

336
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,370
let the e-bike in changing DNS entry
they wanted

337
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,419
what would happen your treasure ISP

338
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,559
to be honest how to do DNS look at a
duty

339
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,870
show you send you to add site with some
do and bad such as those

340
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,490
bogart IPO's um take something that they
say is

341
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,559
taking it to a bank but actually
directed to your own site

342
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,679
that kinda thing we have the same
problem ought I to pee

343
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,030
well the problem it made things not to
trust those people because of people who

344
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,750
do have

345
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,910
essentially amounts to a DNS service

346
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,030
but how much in acetic just as people
keep it

347
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,160
updated and not to take over someone
else might be malicious

348
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,460
us of us without that's one reason onion
addresses all what they are

349
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,150
I'll but those many mods operations this
does

350
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,640
open net which you leading by Pierre
with you this dot net

351
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,390
well you basic can have a friend the
friends connections where

352
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,340
your share things amongst yourselves
which is a little bit more secure

353
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,670
applications for this particular network

354
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,430
would be things like Jay site J site
allows you to inject content into the

355
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,320
free network

356
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,410
like that before nice thing about it
unlike me hosting my GP

357
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,720
um site that which i'd give night to pee
site I had to keep the server running

358
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,220
I could be set to be there you can
inject something into free.net

359
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,590
and that document stays out there even
if your machine goes way ok

360
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,010
this cream ale which basic and email
system

361
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,900
on top of free.net across so if you like

362
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,950
Usenet for Mike functionality and thaw
for file sharing

363
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,420
I we have pros and cons

364
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,940
what you inject something in the network
its stay there for as long as it's

365
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,090
routine request it like that every time

366
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,400
it's not amounting to its okay I don't
have the doc I don't have the docket

367
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,860
allied with the doc pass it back each
note on the way back

368
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,780
get a copy of it so with a summons a
question %uh

369
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,640
nice to be faster to get it it's going
to be more reliably arm

370
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,240
cashed places and got more done see
citizen job keep even on this

371
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,830
also for posting documents about having
to pay mister so someone was just 12

372
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,030
release in for the public not going
though who is leasing it

373
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:34,340
its problem why deal on solution in
something like come to light EP

374
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,530
cons it's dog slow it's recommended you
start it up and leave it running

375
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,880
I actually have a connection on right
now it's okay and that's gonna have

376
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,270
money last few hours

377
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,800
jetted know but appears um appears also
told you

378
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,100
by the distributed hash table may get a
few we initially installed says like to

379
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,870
talk these guys and he's got to tell you
about

380
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,059
other people who are using free.net

381
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,910
so even if the server that helps the
stock goes down

382
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,250
because issued hash table you're still
be a stay on the network

383
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,670
SUV paste on and that sometimes that
causes problems with a

384
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,400
if you behind a NAT box it will be the
issue

385
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,490
doubly baton Universal Plug & Play It a
handle itself

386
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,160
I don't recommend that texting report
said using and going this point for

387
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,940
those particular ports on your net box

388
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,710
I it doesn't use for accessing the
public Internet

389
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,170
like toy is i2p also but doesn't us

390
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,530
focus much on Nextel on that though it
does have the capabilities

391
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,020
also it's not meant like standard IP
protocol she never gonna be able to

392
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,540
really

393
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,570
I don't can say never but is nothing you
be a bit

394
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,570
SS H into a server inside the docket on
it's more

395
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,200
like I said distributed storage system
breast a lot you can do it

396
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,250
as far as what chart looks like local
you access to everything

397
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,530
over 8 8 a adlai the system itself is
controlled with this is on

398
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,480
3 3.net control points or FCP was

399
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,770
I'm not sure on that now walking to but
then slide on

400
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,120
94 81 as far as what you TP ports
talking over

401
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,160
it's supposed to be random also
understand

402
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,470
that brings with it or we just covered
up two networks

403
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,700
well technically three networks that you
may not have it up before

404
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,700
toil I hope I didn't have to write

405
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,220
okay the hood

406
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,549
bit it was first on came out of a US
Navy

407
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,909
Research Lab denik EFSF took it over

408
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:37,909
and now toy is its own 503 see

409
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:40,919
nonprofit you've got more info about it
ought

410
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,240
at the top of the dialog now the Y a bit
out issues

411
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,590
once again no wise for why developed at
toys

412
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,150
free software and open network that
helps you defend against the flood

413
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,340
network surveillance

414
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,990
that friends personal freedom and
privacy confidential business activities

415
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,200
and relationships and state security
known as

416
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,280
traffic analysis the whatever it is

417
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,760
you can access no internet sites with it
boy accessed or hidden service

418
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,860
so is there a hidden inside up

419
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,630
toys network and people who are using
the toy

420
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,059
engine up how you can access it

421
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,659
is Jerry over local socks pocket you
point your browser at Aug

422
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,809
IRC client at law whatever it is you're
trying to

423
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:28,640
proxy fruit or now toll has by
directional tunnels the way you're

424
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,130
sitting there

425
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,490
out is also the way it's coming back to
you so

426
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,750
but adult toys like a over it has layers

427
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,330
so I was hoping I had a icon there

428
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,549
no doubt okay tore it is a somewhat
directory service also

429
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,919
so we have a central player failed to
agree folk keep information

430
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,520
about the system I'll while back what

431
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,940
China blocked it or directory servers
and this caused the problem for people

432
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,390
trying to access talk they couldn't get
less %uh notes to connect to

433
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,760
that's one reason is that thankful %uh
like was 00 ish

434
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,770
hitting up we're heading out as

435
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,559
out there where you can request a few
done not announced publicly

436
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,640
and used em configured to about the use
those instead

437
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,919
same the block the directory server you
can still get to some the store note:

438
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,830
kneecap posse block all the store

439
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,309
route is out there Alco does that
morning bit

440
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,900
but okay toys like ok it has layers

441
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,039
so they will send a message to talk for
questing a public internet site

442
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,730
you but I thought you had like three
levels on kryptonite

443
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,090
well maybe four that's also paid CPS on
the fall that

444
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,409
first layer goes to the first hop

445
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:43,490
in your proxy chain and

446
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,440
you exchange keys at them but they'll
have to build big dick whipped that one

447
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:47,990
layer

448
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,400
and they don't know what what the
messages a with it initially going to

449
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,500
that puts them acquitted

450
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,600
biggest rip off a layer and stand on to
the next

451
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,330
node this person doesn't know which he
said in the network

452
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,299
doesn't know where it's actually go to
go in the the final run

453
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:07,289
what's actual destination is echo only
the crypt it's one liar

454
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:10,510
then if I guess the exit point

455
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,980
dock at the cryptid and whether there
was supposed to be

456
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,470
get set out on the public Internet and
the whole process

457
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,530
goes back tops direction re
encapsulating at Cal like I

458
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,630
Russian nesting dolls people but by
using these

459
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,000
mobile hot and what was that was a
question knowing

460
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,150
totally no one knows both who sent it
individually

461
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,440
and/or what it was

462
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,059
that was being set borders what was
being requested assuming everything

463
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:42,740
works right

464
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,649
you always can get screwed up on so here
I sit on my that

465
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:53,460
and your caps at anyway docket

466
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,220
sites work a little bit different let's
a go make a torsion service

467
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,450
it's a bit different so first step is

468
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,049
Alice you with the talk I to take the
list the poor notes

469
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,509
from directory server and

470
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:11,950
basic establish the connection out to
the public Internet

471
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,350
that's what this one is I see

472
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:21,019
I separate much already covered this I'm
up go on to him so is one cuz

473
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,409
my previous life covered it okay
screening hidden service

474
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,759
bought pick some introductory points and
build circuits to them

475
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,159
bob is hosting some kind of hidden
service this is using their website

476
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,129
it could be a soviet SS a sin to tow it
could be an IRC server doesn't really

477
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:35,639
matter

478
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:39,750
but this service introductory points and
then

479
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,240
they said that to DB whichever DB was
posted on the directory service base

480
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,440
pair and they do use a distributed hash

481
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,039
system up sort forearm keeping a
database

482
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,990
up hidden services that are out there so
bob advertises the

483
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,110
any insight Alice hears about this

484
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,629
and or she goes out requests

485
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:02,750
from the database justice at the
rendezvous point

486
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:09,750
through it she can a have some stuff
that up to connect to and Bob

487
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,270
so it's getting up info

488
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,150
open the database to be able to contact
Bob print up three points the bobbitt

489
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,780
chosen

490
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,020
doesn't key information that's changed
and

491
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,260
the rendezvous point is a told to Bob

492
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,670
be the duck introductory points and then
they can start

493
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,690
communicating for the rendezvous point

494
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,790
the money point keep in mind also

495
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,520
has several a hot between a in this
illustration looks like you've just

496
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,270
talking to one machine and i wanna see
when I would two people communicating

497
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,390
in reality this actual mobile hopson
that and then

498
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,730
a conspiracy to communicate with each
other that make sense

499
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,420
the body follow it's better to be the
text text that description and disc

500
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,690
folly way through it

501
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,190
on does didn't have two nodes inside a
toilet

502
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,890
does the client node which issue just
being the average user thea playing the

503
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,020
toy browser bundle

504
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,150
does relays and these ones that we lay
traffic by default and toy

505
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,190
you are not to be late unless you choose
to be right actually some reasons to

506
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,230
choose between a cuz you're passing that
was traffic through you

507
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,240
in may confuse traffic analysis attacks

508
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,310
cuz a thing that's been since onto of

509
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,190
from your node businesses your stuff so
it may confuse people

510
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,250
an not have me know what you up to
either

511
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,540
do it also might draw attention bridges

512
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,750
bridges on no I mentioned before I
wasn't come up the right term

513
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,720
when mission to China blocked UD or
directory service well

514
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,500
bridges are meant to stop that and I
most or no gym go and look

515
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,630
out there on the drug users in five all
the torneo juneau

516
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,030
all the point where people someone might
be getting into town to look and block

517
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,560
them all

518
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,000
three bridges work is there's no set
repost or have

519
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,630
all of them well not exactly at least
nine where the public can get to it

520
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,620
BOJ can do is you the sensors used a
request just a couple bridges at a time

521
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,320
used those bridges and so some stop
blocked or you have to manually

522
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,070
configure your to a browser to

523
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:18,630
use this particular bridges and then you
can still get out make sense

524
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,320
I'm you can used to be a our site you
can look at it from others also

525
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,559
email address you email and get a few
these bridges also took guard nodes

526
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,179
the weight or set things up it's not
completely random which a first top is

527
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,419
there's a certain set up notes it
considers more trusted

528
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:39,059
idea behind God knows is if the poorest
person you change a proxy is

529
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,120
is controlled by the same us at that

530
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,450
first proxy is controlled by the same
person at the last proxy

531
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,980
thing to a traffic analysis attack more
easily so

532
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,490
friend thats everybody Dom if I am let's
say marshals

533
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,179
hosting mobile core routers well have
you the first entry point

534
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,600
be wanna hear it marshall and exit point
B one hit Marshall

535
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,389
would be a bad idea because they can
easily collaborate to jump in go

536
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:07,940
well I see to make their coming here to
make going out here

537
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,919
when they coming back in what may going
back out here and quickly no ok this

538
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,419
must be the same connection

539
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:17,630
so does act also possibly I wouldn't say
let's not have

540
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,559
tonight hops be to close the given IP
space

541
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,820
but got no demented make sure the first
hop is likely

542
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,470
a more trusted one up introduction point
to help us to make

543
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,450
text consumers Android 2.0 usually
laying in establishing connections to

544
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,260
hidden services

545
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,289
what it looks like well this is a little
bit older I'm

546
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:42,190
pic but no only the way you are access
it is being a total browser bundle

547
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,740
its nice was that point or configured to
use tor it has a bust-up disabled

548
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,850
by the thoughts in privacy mode and

549
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,510
it just as extra things to keep you from
doing some filling in yourself

550
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,470
compromised

551
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,760
a better step would probably be used
tales tales that Linux distribution

552
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,639
rutan but earlier

553
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:03,899
it as extra firewall rules to make sure
thanks in general

554
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:07,440
can't go any place unless they're going
over tor so

555
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,000
a big help to a browser here fired up

556
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,730
top Firefox already running lovely

557
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,120
I we may have to come back to you in a
bit

558
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,510
close it down

559
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,520
ok so I actually have the talk about up

560
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,260
we bring that back up I don't see that

561
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,549
but so use have

562
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:41,679
your own little special browser that has
been configured in Hardin

563
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,100
to hopefully I'm make it less likely the
things that have been bad for that they

564
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,250
won't necessarily easy let you click on
a word doc

565
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,630
open a Word doc can also have the word
doc start requesting images

566
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,299
of a public internet site not using tor
and we feel what you feel I P addresses

567
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:00,020
if you look at all I think it's a mock
stake a spot it to me docs

568
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,730
facing some people would docs and I'll
text documents

569
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,830
and they will contact you out over the
public Internet and tell you who open a

570
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,520
document

571
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,549
but talk about about it does some things
to keep you from doing that

572
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:14,890
by accident and you can get around on it

573
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,880
and is also its OVA site you can visit

574
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,890
Missy we got we having good ones right
here at the top

575
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:27,660
every

576
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,580
any call relays and

577
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,149
them to make the cut at the OL to
actually visit but huge I'd witnesses

578
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:35,340
and talk browser

579
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,840
that's prolly gonna be a lot safer I've
gotten the configure your own machine

580
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,860
and you want you to go eat

581
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,830
is also up by Dalia which is a little

582
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:49,799
Greek in Fig for using tor know it's no
longer pause the toll browser bundle

583
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,149
application site you might want to use
with it a checkup tales

584
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:57,510
that's at least miss you talk about had
extra precautions in place to keep you

585
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:57,929
from

586
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:01,890
going out in public and that we don't
mean to the total web proxy which

587
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,029
hopefully still exist

588
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,049
these various parties go coming in and
out on

589
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,589
it allows you to access the

590
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:14,409
toward network from the public Internet
so if you wanna visit ticket .in site

591
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:18,020
you flash point at this browse at the
site and proxy into it

592
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,570
the downside is this person knows your
real IP address whoever they are

593
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,919
so you know you may not want to say to
do that

594
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:31,849
cool at me escape out this axis even
visit this

595
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,720
site assuming that

596
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,280
here at masa we actually got the network
completely functional I we're gonna go

597
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,510
back here

598
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:49,510
she or check back on if it in a sec

599
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,940
but you go to the hidden wiki it a point
off to a bunch other sites you may wanna

600
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,570
check out

601
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,970
I also give you information about torn
at work

602
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,630
stallion you if you over I'm way if you
are so so quote address

603
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,390
you know it's like this you can't give
it covet exhibit I actually silkroad

604
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,180
the way they did that is this has to do
with the criminal password crack was

605
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,220
to be able the brute force a name

606
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,380
that would have the first only kid is
actually wanted if you only do like

607
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,010
eight characters its feasible to do I

608
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,450
sky let's do that like I could generate
a key for I E

609
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:29,010
some gibberish dot onion as all songs
that unkept

610
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,830
with cement allow you to a proxy more
things overt or

611
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,440
I and outfit onions at 10 but my insight
so I'm toy in general

612
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,770
go check out onions but being fat
mountains in the oven

613
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,970
various got any insights gotta keep in
mind a lot he cites coming go

614
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,100
yo w/ out a loud and disappear okay
hidden wiki

615
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,350
it moved and its hofer go take me to the
hidden wiki

616
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:58,040
inside and this is what toy address to
talk to an address not only looks like

617
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,880
not exactly very user-friendly but
inside here

618
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,320
you'll find links of also over
information I'll

619
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,880
find such energy Muse inside

620
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,160
SC find financial services

621
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,390
someplace in his prolly unless the black
markets hosting

622
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,860
and a weapon sites and files and images
and so forth

623
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,870
some forms are in here prize in Chan's a
backup copy a quickie links for anybody

624
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,550
wants access it not a public Internet

625
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,730
just a ton insights you go visit

626
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,090
and the soft dock markets after earlier
great

627
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,580
as well oh yes grams is a search engine
I'm not mistaken for

628
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,500
but docket market I have a link but

629
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,070
that in one my slides now opposing
conduct or

630
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,870
if you can't I'll miss a SOCKS proxy you
can make it

631
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:59,040
work with this protocol pretty much %uh
Esprit levels a proxy by default

632
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,190
have I guess more that we've got home I
hidden services

633
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,370
so it's relatively anonymous

634
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,790
this means our tax mostly attacks have
involved things on the client level

635
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,710
because the I

636
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,400
the person who use it isn't stupid on

637
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,080
for instance the be all book hit the I
was running the vigil silkroad got

638
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,540
caught

639
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,790
because he was asking you asking for
advice on

640
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,160
doing various things a bit coining using
his

641
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,210
email address I'll gmail actually had
his real name in it like

642
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,900
all brick he was doing various things
like that but

643
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,240
and that can lead to his downfall just
do you think that fine up with one name

644
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,010
but 10 change it to something else like
frosty has one healthy use

645
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,410
but then something but use names on a
box

646
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,330
that was hosting a so growed

647
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:53,950
also had frosty as the username some the
code he was asking for help for

648
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,990
on Stack Overflow

649
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,660
with the same code that was found on so
proud so on so forth

650
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,210
basically he left a lot about cookie
crumbs thing back to him everyone's

651
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,700
heart attack

652
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,530
let's play core they got on it's not a
hunting clear to me any go back insisted

653
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,190
the court documents have come out sets

654
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,820
but I somehow get the impression that
they busted one with admin

655
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,330
and give accessed it to the server
whatcha actor that you actually

656
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:23,060
that P the server more likely then you
go confiscated make image

657
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,500
get my state as you can from it also he
I'm

658
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,580
how you connect connected directly on
the service from a coffee shop nearby

659
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,410
were here

660
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,660
we lived

661
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,310
cons can be slow though it's in

662
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,310
proved mass lesions a speedo last
several years

663
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,400
at the semi fixed infrastructure
presence

664
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,250
but yeah in seventeen before the Great
Firewall child blocked a percent of

665
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,180
total relays

666
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,710
because their lesson directory which is
why your bridges on point have around

667
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,720
and it's fairly easy to tell someone is
using it on the server side

668
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,930
I have scripts all my site the essay
tell me if you're using toward a visit

669
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,250
me

670
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:09,250
so you visit my website

671
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,920
today we're not using toy I TP it
changes with the logo is

672
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,920
me do this he also assuming as a scout
proxy

673
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,670
K

674
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,780
remain that failing anyway here's me
billy goat or

675
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,020
and your easy spot someone was using toy

676
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,069
how does actually a guy and oh no it
wasn't Wednesday at Harvard it was

677
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:44,589
who issued a bomb threat aidid over toy
and cuz you want to

678
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:48,530
get outs class your head I think I final
something on it to me when I get outta

679
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,079
class

680
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,980
so try to put in a bomb threat it raced
down the old personal email this

681
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,380
was doing overt or they traced on who on
the network which isn't what the time

682
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,059
and a cat pin it down him if you do the
coffee shop down the road instead of

683
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,440
using the university's wifi

684
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,250
to access to or if I wanna got caught
also if you just

685
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,410
did admit to any man I caught that the
madness other people on the harbour

686
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,079
network

687
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:14,450
using toy at the same time this is the
one you were talking to you

688
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,730
that's also true

689
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,559
a tow truck look at this into
perspective

690
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,640
now okay localize what do you see

691
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,490
local you gonna have put 9050 9051 open

692
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:34,630
but these 0 in committed by a hundred
years the toll browse a bungled the way

693
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,089
they do this is you can I have a fixed
in place to talk host you can service

694
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:42,920
but you're using the browser bundle for
your personal web surfing

695
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,390
I might be one reason why you do this
remote most traffic seems to go over

696
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,880
4438 eighty

697
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,670
mostly and you may also see some service
the listening on port 9100

698
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,170
for directory information on on I

699
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,180
9030

700
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,970
more information about these about how
to detect or so forth at my site and

701
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,630
movies has

702
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,040
some on his side as well there's also
some any distance more time researching

703
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,059
the toy or up traffic if you didn't know

704
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:14,859
a tickler sir via comtex contacting us
for the tone at work

705
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:19,240
you can catch out store traffic because
love the way the packets looking not

706
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,670
acquitted the certain sizes you can look
and say oh despite or traffic

707
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,160
who's actually looked on on of ops few

708
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,359
proxy but to make toy traffic look like
something else

709
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,670
I was at yeah up obfuscate biopsy proxy
Triesman chat like something else this

710
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,140
could be something HTTP traffic sky
traffic

711
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,480
just make a little bit less obvious
because the people know

712
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,880
how does the term for this particular
dilemma if of

713
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,579
if people know that you're sending
traffic even know where it is

714
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,770
disaffected China may not amiss may
raise some flags

715
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,160
some people a place in the sea

716
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,559
as it on a different audience I thought
you could visit caught on years ago

717
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,530
index page

718
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:06,010
the starting point at or directory
hidden wiki which we visit earlier

719
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,280
unless it is something similar toe links
or just something similar

720
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,150
those new york strong box if you want to
submit some up kept the newspaper

721
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:13,940
anonymously

722
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,510
and then does grams which is underground
well

723
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,150
on about black market search engine

724
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,299
is the best thing this call call it US
search for something that the contraband

725
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:25,619
a

726
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,700
something like the drugs Aug guns what
might be illegal

727
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,420
have like a great great spots Great
Britain depending on type a gun

728
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:39,089
you can go out there and may be fine on
gramm's lot of things the stock market's

729
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,680
use big point for exchange because look
beyond my abilities explain

730
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,750
in the sub talk but to take a quick look
and see

731
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,660
it uses prove work to had essentially
generate value

732
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,829
who work with that I did everything came
out a

733
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:58,109
as an idea to stop spam back in the late
90's

734
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,150
the idea is you to ask the person who

735
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,030
stressin email to solve a problem for
you actually accept email

736
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,050
this might be some long lines up well I
know it

737
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:13,370
password here's a hash find you a
password is

738
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,090
that maybe approval work thank it will
quick to take a pass when fine hash

739
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,280
no one that I got the right answer takes
a long time to take a hash

740
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,580
and turned a password to be an example
approval work

741
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,170
because I know will come true for work
you have addresses and private keys and

742
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,010
you can basically take the pic once you
have

743
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:34,630
exiled others always keep track up in
this big block changes ledger

744
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,930
everybody keeps other whose exchanged
what

745
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,350
the space got tumblers the cap confuse
who's actually exchanged

746
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,640
bitcoins on it so it's kinda like up
money laundering away

747
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,310
s follows its redirects transaction so
it's hard to trace who exchanged who

748
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:55,840
bitcoins look at the iraqis expand
Special

749
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,170
my time left: am Not sure I be able to
expand nearly as well as bob

750
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:04,520
why scan but I have a talk has out there
from %uh b-sides delaware in 2013 Jeep I

751
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,300
check out

752
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,520
tons up more talkin services out there
besides web services

753
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,690
those are I'll see said you may not want
chatting with

754
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,860
sent people on the internet was also
I'll see service

755
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,870
those people who made her own private or
net based networks

756
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,540
like anchi I'm not sure this doesn't
mess on the monarchy's before water at

757
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,890
least

758
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,120
they don't wat network that you could
use

759
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,720
and this is the week doing it all on
commercial service in hello more

760
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,700
juice to it at the time at least it was
faster than the public tour

761
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,640
not sure that's true at this point O
everything I do P

762
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,810
i2p it was developed by

763
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:46,990
got aim Jons and chair and hacker idea
behind it is to act as an ah-mazing leon

764
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:47,500
internet

765
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,650
it focuses more dough on hidden service
element

766
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,690
dan out talks in the public in it there
is now a proxy on Easter has been the

767
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,270
past

768
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,150
it is not currently I'm working right
now

769
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:03,570
but its main focus is think they can
services in the case a website that be

770
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:07,490
excite but also to allow peer to peer
file sharing and so forth

771
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,870
it comes built and with the web so
odiaun for saying a peep sight

772
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,190
only has the software never doing peer
to peer and what not

773
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,220
and how how to access that is locally
red foxes you can connect to

774
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,849
and control via a web browser

775
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:24,539
and it allows you to set up i2p tunnels
and communicate over them

776
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:29,069
and in like I might or which is that the
directory server for some thanks this is

777
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:29,499
all

778
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:34,079
distribute hash table so if the course
it was went down it could still function

779
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,950
and they call the Lord stupid hash table
net DB

780
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,359
nothing so different about i2p is

781
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,720
the cuddles of not bi directional

782
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,069
you will send out a request 31 said a
titles in this case

783
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:51,229
we have like three hops that charlie is
making a request

784
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:54,779
because in the entitles the person by
actually hosting something

785
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:58,069
goes through like duh number pops
buddy's number pops a completely

786
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,829
configurable

787
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:03,049
you can choose be more private of faster
depending what you want and that

788
00:46:03,049 --> 00:46:06,049
actually travel back to the person via a
different

789
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:10,569
set up connections this causes more
problems are doing traffic analysis to

790
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:12,249
figure out who's talking to our network

791
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:17,869
and a slight I have no I don't think
I'll be able to get to as a mission

792
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:22,099
but its not bi directional

793
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,749
your anything out tunnels not missus
same the not thinking the same pass

794
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:30,849
yes

795
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:32,620
all

796
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,270
out actually contigo to stop and get on
it also you that something similar to

797
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:36,790
the way

798
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:40,310
toward does onion routing it does what
he called going we can

799
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,350
mixed messages the events in the on
Mustang technically doesn't do this

800
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,920
right now

801
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,660
but the protocol could allow for the
future is you might assume the message

802
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,200
through a tunnel and posit go to
different people

803
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,610
all nite mixed traffic other people
together and then send it on

804
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:59,900
go how ask ZZZ that the developer right
now apparently this is not an accurate

805
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,680
depiction of the way it works

806
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,220
but this game I similar to toy and
mobile hops

807
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:10,360
happening but I'll how missus traffic
flow at different the several layers

808
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,190
encryption you could end n 17 kitchen

809
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:19,640
you encrypt it all one title and off the
next title

810
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,440
we didn't have a question each hop along
the way has own level encryption

811
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,460
a combination of el-gamal ATS and

812
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,170
more AES using diffie-hellman exchanges

813
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,520
was it look like

814
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,740
jelly configured via a web browser you
consider how about long what it tells

815
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,270
the be

816
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:41,670
you can set up things like to our host
the website you can get into the

817
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,700
built-in

818
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,680
could be a file-sharing software based
on BitTorrent now by default addresses

819
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,040
ago look something like this

820
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,460
of naming services out there which
basically about 20 distribute host file

821
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,880
with that in a public Internet before I
am DNS took off

822
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,910
actual people maintain host files that
you exchange each other

823
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:05,520
to Matt names to IP addresses the
party's name services

824
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,590
services is there any you take over
someone bad

825
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,760
they might be direct you to a different
key there's also basically two addresses

826
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,380
that look like this generous right here

827
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,440
that you can use without having to use
to zens almost if I can actually

828
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,500
access antiques

829
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,820
dot i2p I may or may not be able to
depending on what all is blocked here

830
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,950
may not be added as this Stephen you
jump service to get to it

831
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:39,950
open a few tabs

832
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,720
see meals on

833
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,010
to connect that may or may not work
depending on how does no good

834
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,510
here University setup I could be pros
and cons

835
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:58,339
pros not support applications of people
poured thanks

836
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:02,230
to book i2p and it comes built Innova
but applications like I said the web

837
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,730
server

838
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,119
and up housing server and links of

839
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:09,369
since they do your I two-piece email
system if you want to use it

840
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:12,670
I you can create just about anythin
services if you can

841
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,920
proxy it overstocks tunnel but I thought
using

842
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,790
ATP titles HTTP proxies for most your
excite surfing

843
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,760
but you can configure Sox parties as
well in the past

844
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,760
me it seemed fast and talk and services
that's not so true now

845
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,200
toys that a lot of work and is improved
that a whole lot no single point of

846
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,450
failure see all the way about

847
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,260
so much about the on issue with fed
directly so being taken out

848
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,480
NP not being a big into the network no
tolls as inkatha measures that

849
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,200
as well const limit out parties not only
for public 7 the public Internet

850
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,260
and as you saw earlier the fall out
proxy

851
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,410
he would down I just can't connect to it
right now and

852
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,569
also possibly more prone to several
attacks

853
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:01,560
the advantage of having a centrally
controlled fan light or issue my peers

854
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,119
spot

855
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,140
bad actors Billy accursed this one said
if people can say oh

856
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,030
yet doctors and bad deadlines and bad a
similar attack is where

857
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,680
you have one entity controlling multiple
nodes and using them

858
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,140
as the sock puppets

859
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,810
could control the way the network works
and ferry it. /p might be a lil bit more

860
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,750
prone to that

861
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,680
consummate sites out there including my
own to antiques .it p

862
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,930
which shall not be to bring up and I am

863
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,570
money at a time so I won't be recovered
base attack strategies poly but

864
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,940
would be god bless this alters I'll see
both into it. PS have to

865
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,130
points I'll see Klein at it this show
you do that

866
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,860
you go into your identification and make
sure it doesn't have something you don't

867
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,550
want their

868
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,270
but despite a fall classic on I was
using choose my username of the local

869
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:48,920
machine

870
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,240
that was Adrian a by who did I like a

871
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,540
by clicking fingered me and figure out
well look at my information would see

872
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,340
0 he signed in as Adrian they get a
little bit too much information about me

873
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,990
and Susie males already built in there
for sending email

874
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,130
bit tort a you down on email client if
you want

875
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,350
ok Tahoe up LA FS that's a distributed
file system

876
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,460
sort of like a well stocked with
free.net and actors tunnel plug in out

877
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:14,850
there

878
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,950
now I don't have time for the
correlation attacks Coast

879
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,190
you up at on you for three right

880
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,590
Jason your 30 ID

881
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,190
I think i'm ok I call action on covers
real quick

882
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,710
you know my okay well

883
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:37,199
I belong to now some basic attacks on
dot net

884
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,619
those correlations up in points exit
points what you might do is just watch

885
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:41,140
how

886
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,439
the tracks Wallingford and what all in
cryptid I could give you keys

887
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:48,839
every point you if you see someone make
a5 mega quest

888
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,189
into the network and you see 8 make me
spots come back

889
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:56,619
through a sicko for these two nodes at
think at a pattern

890
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:01,079
before the timing and sizes you can use
a cast signals intelligence to know so I

891
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:01,699
might be

892
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:06,390
who figure out who's talking to who I

893
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,829
time correlation also about when the

894
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,369
communications happening along with the
sizes you do things like

895
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:18,029
docent service you suspect to be in the
flow the traffic and see how that

896
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:22,459
cause the reaction to the top track
going over the i'd network

897
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:26,209
but says he suspects that server may be
hosting a

898
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:30,369
talkin server you can try to attack a
deed of

899
00:52:30,369 --> 00:52:34,349
its public Internet facing side

900
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:38,130
add CBC reaction to traffic going on the
docket

901
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:43,419
or see that fight just disappears you
could also possibly pulse traffic

902
00:52:43,419 --> 00:52:46,839
as it was going through let's say you in
the hostel on the way you can try to lay

903
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:47,559
the message

904
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:50,599
sorta like tag it and did you see that

905
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,589
timing difference later on down the line
you might be to figure out who's talking

906
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,619
to whom

907
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:59,729
but change load up after possibly do the
same kinda fun

908
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:02,969
modification %uh timing so hopefully
maybe a spot that

909
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:06,539
over down the line that's actually a
whole lot of weddings snowed in

910
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:07,169
documents

911
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:12,089
where there was a two-layer talk nothing
is called a match near

912
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:15,859
that was something similar this both
have a height of course hammer

913
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,130
asked that question every single time I
did talk like this

914
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,309
motion here some along those lines

915
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:26,299
with Sun something along those lines
other flaws

916
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:31,009
DNS league CPL configure talk properly
it's not with these top

917
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:36,469
well you want me to be done if you don't
use it

918
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:40,669
to a browser bundle or you don't
configure your rather properties I got

919
00:53:40,669 --> 00:53:41,599
DNS leaks

920
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,449
where it will make a request for the

921
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:50,630
up I hadn't site your DNS server first
try five IP address

922
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:55,019
even though it's not the public Internet
none today you want to send that network

923
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:55,979
is actually

924
00:53:55,979 --> 00:53:59,199
being sent your DNS server but a DNS
server

925
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,999
still knows that oldest person tried
access the Silk Road

926
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:06,089
it all summer long this

927
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:10,049
if you have your socks party not set in
Firefox to say

928
00:54:10,049 --> 00:54:13,749
do DNS lookups role over proxy

929
00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:17,019
in Mason of the public Internet so in
that case

930
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:20,829
you requesting so growth something that
onion

931
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:24,409
that DNS in toledo go study it

932
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:27,849
s server at your ISP and they have an
idea

933
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:32,680
who are you trying to visit yeah

934
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,869
but talk about but I only have
configured by beginning you can

935
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:36,579
configure it by

936
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:40,329
in Firefox yourself but this to be a
client you talk about the bundle all

937
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:41,160
IOU's tales

938
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:47,119
see you can also do things like to make
a hidden so the contact your the public

939
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:47,540
Internet

940
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,200
have a demo of this I think my show me
con assessing via Web

941
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,589
flaw on a our website on

942
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:58,579
talkin service are excite expert at
Florida State command injection

943
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:02,010
have it pain you from its real IP
address and then listen

944
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:08,190
for the traffic and figure out a who the
real person is behind it all

945
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,310
so uses expert code and have it shovel
shell back to you over the public

946
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:12,770
Internet

947
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,560
to know who they are they have anything
like a any flaws long lines of command

948
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,490
injection I have time or sites on Doc
nets

949
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,700
these might or I GP notes to try to
access the

950
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,550
excite version up but I can't seem to
get out on the snow today a

951
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:32,680
I also have a class on dot net is about
three hours long if you are washed and

952
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,050

953
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:38,260
I have overview uva dot nets attack
strategies

954

decided for various comp says if we send
a good F Khan and Shah Mikan last year
