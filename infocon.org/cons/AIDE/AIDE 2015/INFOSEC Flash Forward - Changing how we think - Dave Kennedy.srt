1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,360
well thin

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,429
well access get alright megastar here

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,830
prosze coming outs I'll the stock when I

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,059
when I created it sits my seems kinda
run along the same lines out

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,020
know hey I i show you kinda where we're
at as far as an industry goes and kind

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,910
or we need to head to you but also the
same time I break a lot of stuff and

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,170
ensure like 02 so it's like i neva in
between

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,760
on those types of talks I just prefer it
has to myself

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,110
I'm dick and im the founder a trusted
sec which is a

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,610
informations get a consulting company
out including Ohio I start another

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,770
company called up by nari defense which
does 24/7 monitoring a texan looking for

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,770
attackers in

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,660
things like that um prior to that I was
a chief security officer for

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,559
for the bold our industry program had
about fifty-four people are so on the

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,110
team

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,210
it really bothers /url crop the house or
to trust a sec

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,620
as the smart now Martin in the morn ones
camber last week

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,670
on but prior to that i've testified for
the congress I got a few times I

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,540
money News quite often I do like a lot
interviews on my CNN and Fox I was just

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,150
on a CNBC on Monday

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,460
not talking about the whole FAA stop I
guess on

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,210
wrote the book mess with the penetration
testers guide I will ask author

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,880
about that with a much older folks from
the carolinas group and then I also

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,920
created a social engineer its okay its
artillery and a few other tools out

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,390
there

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,540
and then I'm I was a marine deployed in
Iraq God that took

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,540
put iraq for not to jurors just about
two and half years over there

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,159
and that's mister sick stuffed

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,060
and so if you look at what our mission
is in and security are trying to do

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,899
if you look at it I guess it's about ten
years ago our our goal was like stop all

31
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,549
attacks right we're supposed to be able
to

32
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,880
now stop attacks from happening because
the attacks themselves

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,220
we're still pretty low as far as Brian
goes and we could do things like you

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,570
know

35
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,880
Antivirus is a beast detecting a decent
amount of a VOB

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,039
signatures and things like that and the
volume really was out there and so you

37
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:57,130
know it ten years ago we were like okay
we need to protect our company's 100

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,750
percent

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,670
against attackers but that's no longer
the case that the the hacking industry

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,759
to hacking scene has gone so much larger

41
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,950
on that's impossible in RI in order for
us to the stop a lot of those so we've

42
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,780
had to make a lot of changes in kinda
change your mind sets the say

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,620
okay you know our mission now is to
protect everything in our corporations

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,130
are to protect our computers are protect
our environments

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,440
it's really to try to minimize the
damage to the company

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,130
in the event that we get are getting I'm
and also that act as it's happening

47
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,489
I was just a neon it's in response for
extremely large fortune 1000 company

48
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,069
and I'm they got the reason why they
they're down to go down if I that there

49
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,739
are compromises that the FBI not I know
it's okay

50
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,900
you've been compromised a man in we're
not sure how long or whatever so we got

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,260
are brought in to do a lot of the

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,510
and send response and I is not good when
the domain controllers are picking out a

53
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,120
command control service from China

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,569
I am and has been for two and half years
I it's probably not a good thing right

55
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,260
I'm so you know we got to get better at
detection and looking at

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,150
what you know is actually occurring in
these these types of patterns that

57
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
attackers use

58
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,609
I mean that the same methods that these
attackers specifically use are the same

59
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,480
techniques that i use that Martin is
that everybody in the pen testing

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,319
injuries I mean

61
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,600
if you don't know I mean the threat
actors are using me cats and using

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,400
Metasploit interpreter and they have
their own custom stuff i mean here's my

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,079
plug axe and a few other ones but

64
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,310
I mean it's just general run demille
stuff that we use on a regular basis as

65
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,350
do they as well

66
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,500
I'm so so I think sophisticated it's
nothing crazier

67
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,100
are you know I easier day related it's
it's always the same type of stuff

68
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,430
they've Fisher some sort of

69
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,329
you know on campaign was to document our
website the compromise and then from

70
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,040
there they do

71
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,730
lateral move

72
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,989
since the rest the network I in
compromise everything else and so

73
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,080
now that the problem we face right now
is that the industry you know as move

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,250
towards you know we have to focus on
this advanced actor stop with the focus

75
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,849
on this advanced persistent threats when

76
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,480
really it's pat down to the basics I
mean if its organization is working with

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,290
had you know

78
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm significant never segmentation they
did education awareness on the user's

79
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,590
they had a de semana texan program

80
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,349
specific IP addresses that they're
beginning out to you are known IP

81
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,519
addresses for two years

82
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,480
so they're known bad IP addresses you
know from command control servers for

83
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,150
two years

84
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,170
so I mean he just had basic controls in
place and also that's also a server that

85
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,420
I

86
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,989
that I wrote had those IP address never
like four years so I mean it's like you

87
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,250
know what I like to hear but

88
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,120
I embosser but that it has secured
coding practices you know

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,150
secured integration just a common
concepts that stop a lot of the things

90
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,280
that we see out there

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm gonna be a much different story then
you're trying to buy a product lines

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160
actually got fixed thanks

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,610
and so we see these breaches happen and
you are still trying to figure out now

94
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,280
what's the secret recipe

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,500
aren't actually stop a lot is a tax that
happening the major problem is you know

96
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,510
when you see a bug like hardly eat or

97
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,250
ob Dennis of fifty no 30s was or 38 I

98
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,260
or any these big ones that come out that
happen accompanies knee-jerk reaction is

99
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,120
to go out there just like

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,210
okay we need to fix this because we're
gonna be targeted by it and from there

101
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,120
we need to go and buy something that's
gonna fix it like out my favorite is

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,070
like that APT prevention stuff like fire
eisin

103
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,590
you know all those great things right me
know how easy it is to get on fire I'm

104
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,260
never tried really needs eggs are you
know it's a mariner hacking at across

105
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,050
right we we we broken a customer ask a
month and a half ago

106
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,000
and you know had access to everything I
K did you know how to how to get around

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,889
a fire I might

108
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,950
and even know you had a damn I'm sorry
up mean it's really hard right

109
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,160
on APT stuff you know that they tout
their DOB doesn't let you look at what

110
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,280
other than maybe giving it a more
visibility which isn't a bad thing

111
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,030
I'm if you have a program out there CC a
lot these things happen

112
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,560
I am and then you ought to make you head
by APTN a shine in China

113
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,620
you know it's what's interesting is is
it a mixt analyze on them our our that

114
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,580
was published in an hour from that the
north koreans Sony breach

115
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,719
at is as I like the elevators mean like
1985 a drop like nine different binaries

116
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,449
I really noisy is commercial and product
to inject into that actually I'm wipe

117
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,249
the hard drive our

118
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:51,779
something that literally a bunch of you
know high school kids could coated in

119
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:52,599
the locker room

120
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,879
you know over over weekend in order to
destroy what happened to Sony and yet

121
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,369
that was

122
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:59,629
sophisticated and it was a known actor
and it was

123
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:02,589
you know heavily targeted and all those
other things really so if you know like

124
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,789
how to code in bash

125
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,360
you're now a sophisticated actor of
China that's what we've created in this

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,259
industry so few

127
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,999
not a program your sophisticated so
congratulations your sophisticated year

128
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:15,639
you took a C-plus class you know it was
it was it was classes are also now

129
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,990
a threat actor that can original China
North Korean destroy entire company West

130
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:26,180
horrible horrible code so that's a wrap
look at that the exportation methods

131
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,499
I'm nothing's really changed he still
sees are compromises you know from

132
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,789
exploitation impending post exportation
ya

133
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,860
user compromises what's been interesting
is that

134
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,949
job is actually I'm been reduced
significantly over the past year so

135
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,979
I job was by far the number one most
attacked of her brother exportation

136
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:46,449
obvious change now set to more job he
and most specifically

137
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,830
of flash but doesn't mean it does any
better you look at the update cycles for

138
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,419
Java

139
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,680
has like you know it like he fix like
270 bugs and we also fix like 970

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,009
security fixes you know so

141
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,029
the coding still horrible on a job it's
just people are actively publishing

142
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:06,499
on those active experts out there on
these a compromise is always action 62

143
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:09,680
I he's funny being discontinued to get
run to close for that

144
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,080
after work I'll

145
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,729
dollars the moving a Spartan right as it
was the whole you know Halo theme or

146
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,830
whatever your cart on spark now and
everything

147
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,870
I'm and so if you look at IEEE exploits
II exports rose 32 percent from usher

148
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm so just goes to show you I mean you
know even I i company that has a good

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,909
on secure coding practice typed up and
I'm like Microsoft has got a lot better

150
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,580
probably won the most sophisticated

151
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,809
I'm still has significant exposures up
especially when

152
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,090
now in its use of complexity

153
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,300
up but I mean you know the two men
expert said as British methods we

154
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,210
typically see

155
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,450
now you know user gets finished sent an
email compromises on

156
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,620
and it's usually through malicious
website those use the easiest because

157
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,020
you can coax make things

158
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,160
I'm in a pretty believable when it comes
to web site especially to make it some

159
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,660
ugly one summer should perform

160
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,290
something click link and compromise the
attachments are still out there but are

161
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,190
much less

162
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,410
are prominent you know it you know it
would give you like five or six years

163
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,580
ago you had the

164
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,010
you know files in txt inside a bit and
people are sheltering an answer summer

165
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,930
open up a zip file and open up an EXE in
america compromise right

166
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,470
on now it's more sound like document or
file format bugs

167
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm so i cant Adobe things I you know
office

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,060
product lines but those are still are
less common up from exploitation

169
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,260
a lot less come as well i mean the white
when you can go in and fish individuals

170
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,350
it's a lot easier on set to target
individual in earnest to try to hack and

171
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,790
find sequence action and then from there
compromise

172
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,810
but a lotta cases on the CMS is are
being hacked but we're press for example

173
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,440
urging la

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,410
as mostly on the the formal plugin
extensions on the lotto sites have a

175
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,520
ladder an extension that has a
vulnerability on it

176
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,830
and getting compromise in the website
out what sorts of pickup becomes

177
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,490
compromised

178
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,250
and then the pivoting oppose equitation
again I mean

179
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,580
to of this case something arching crept
into to make a payload

180
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm not get picked up by Endpoint
Protection is is extremely trivial

181
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,880
I and so if you look at like Symantec
Endpoint Protection or Mac if you're so

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,120
close are all the different you know an
embarrassment as you see out there

183
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,320
there are extremely trivial ought to get
around and you can buy a program online

184
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,030
for $30 box we can just find free ones
that are online that kept them for you

185
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,590
as one out there called high Perian on
which is a really great once its

186
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,760
are you can see before you die it takes
to execute a ball

187
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,870
and it encrypts it in Naas a container
okay so the

188
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,730
the your daughter show code is a cryptid
a memory right and NAS container

189
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,480
and so in order to get access that it
has to I'm perforce a key so actually

190
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,640
brute force itself

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,780
it uses a week a S key in amber forces
up until it finds a key and at the crib

192
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,610
sets of a memory

193
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,620
such a unique one every single time it's
kinda minutes and concepts I'm really be

194
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,340
found at an open source one the new
version is came out as a lot more

195
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,230
obfuscation techniques on the Trillium
those are are easy to get

196
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,300
an impending approx post exportation you
know

197
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,200
compromising the sites and from there
going into one hacking into the rest

198
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,209
you know kinda a trivial our challenge
and so you know

199
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,950
we have the same problem ugh the initial
focus on technology verses was really a

200
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,870
people problem

201
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,200
focuses on expanding the ski program
making a large urn getting more people

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,310
and you know game or technology support
those people

203
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,410
on and being able to try to get to a
program to where you can identify

204
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,079
threats

205
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,420
of faster a problem is that security for
me isn't a

206
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,350
job technical problems a social and if
you've ever seen

207
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,760
I was an ancient aliens 48 you know i i
watch the show for the first time I ever

208
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,790
saw the means come out this this guy as
a cancer

209
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,040
I'll but I think he was explaining how
like Franklin donna del roosevelt had

210
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,040
you know architect at this triangle in
downtown Washington in DC that that

211
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,410
could be a sign for aliens are coming
that were the focal point in essence the

212
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,750
focal point account I lost all respect I
put them in every one my powerpoints

213
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:49,329
on but security is is something that to
me is is more a communication issue

214
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:53,610
than as a technology or I what we have a
senior technology to do to prevent

215
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,440
technology

216
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,000
but in most cases a security program
inside a corporation is unstructured

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,880
hot to handle what we see out there mean
you look at any type of %ah chief

218
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,810
security officer in most cases they're
dealing with business things and then

219
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,529
you have the team is kinda underneath
them

220
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,130
and they're fighting fires every single
day not structured in a way actually be

221
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,380
successful because the company's
understand

222
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,910
what they do or what they're trying to
do I mean most companies that you see a

223
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,170
successful program they have a very good
presence

224
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,529
on for older people and so for me when
you let people focused on

225
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,160
on you know during specific technology
things are much less solutions an

226
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,260
industry that hasn't focused on products
and

227
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,380
on what's interesting is that is a big
conference going on right now called

228
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,199
RCRA

229
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,740
I haven't gone our I want our say once
I'll never go again

230
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,160
I walked into the vendor area however I
got sick to my stomach job because of

231
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,269
what they're doing have

232
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,149
no booth babes in your people like cash
in his little things you try to grab

233
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,470
cash and stuff like that and it was like
it was just a complete show I love

234
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,839
are trying to coax you into going to
their their bussey you can buy their

235
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,510
products

236
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,100
and that's exactly what this industry
has turned into which is

237
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,990
a pretty scary when I mean granted an
interest in the technology is really

238
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,470
great

239
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,900
but it's usually put into place before

240
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm actually on its establishment just
for me it was it was I literally got

241
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,000
physically sick to my stomach

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,150
and had to walk out of there I'll never
go Darcy ever again and so if you are

243
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,460
from at the purple team I i saw this
castle a couple times

244
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,440
I but it's a combination of the red to
blue team us working together

245
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,270
am a huge fan of it because um as
anybody on the defense

246
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,410
I protecting anybody on the offense

247
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,960
then you're not a security at all
scariest okay that there could be

248
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,820
and I i have that effect so

249
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,220
you so if you have

250
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,380
via people I defense appear on the
offense I'm coming together to

251
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,320
understand

252
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,190
1i was really important part and out we
talk about the purple team

253
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,340
the concert that talked about a lot of
on but it's something that

254
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,170
that I've been focusing on a special %ah
to the last year's and show you are a

255
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,170
couple examples that

256
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,730
so lately

257
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,670
on we've been having a lot of fun like
you know we will go into an assessment

258
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,550
will break n

259
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm and you know after that we try to
build something our editor tutorial or

260
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,140
do something like I'll show you when
you're just a second rosanna Pentastar

261
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,960
yesterday

262
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,670
and on you we had compromised the
external website or single injection

263
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,080
okay

264
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,450
got access to the online operating
system we're running as a very limited

265
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,230
I user account so we had this guy is
never service which is very little user

266
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,310
account happening system

267
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,270
and so we we couldn't do anything to
prevent escalation been trying for

268
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,930
price three or four days mara's work had
to be I mean the work that we've all

269
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,030
been working on trying to try to get out
get process patients she because any

270
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,470
compromise machine a DMZ

271
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,480
the hope is that you can leverage that
the piggyback and and deep having a

272
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,740
letter released into the environment

273
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,220
so when I to figuring out is that saddam
that the domains run to separate them

274
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,920
and CNS

275
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,840
you had a a domain that basically US was
inside the DMZ in another domain which

276
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,930
is kinda corporate you know
infrastructure right

277
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,290
demand so two separate didn zzzz very
good infrastructure

278
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,390
on that one way trust between the two so
the on

279
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,420
internal domain trusted

280
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,180
the DMZ the main okay I'm so I was able
to do from there

281
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,460
is a %ah

282
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,450
%uh there's a technical recycling that
allows you to enumerate users

283
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,440
and if the one demand going after and a
query the other domain if it has a trust

284
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,180
established

285
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,200
I think where those users and cycle
through end up a whole list of user

286
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,120
accounts on Adam and the ants I
corporate demand right

287
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,330
second of all the those users on inside
and from there are brute force all the

288
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,040
user accounts

289
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,200
reversal user accounts across a fine one
that's like summer 2015 another one up

290
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,140
after one

291
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,370
you know on those are things I find two
or three I legitimate user accounts

292
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,589
saw define three user accounts I've been
logged in through OWA OWA

293
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,649
how's that going to be a server on on
the outside logged in and I sent an

294
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,260
email from this individual

295
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,690
to a couple people on this team actually
spent all last night I was up last night

296
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,360
so probably

297
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,640
your laptop o'clock going through
individual emails to find the perfect

298
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,430
one day when you find that perfect email

299
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,420
like that's the one you know that's the
one that's going to get me in because

300
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,140
they already have a communication
establish a party talked about it

301
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,550
and so is you know it was %uh person
ninety in a compromising and they're

302
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,310
talking about

303
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,750
you know changes for the environments
and you know going through some process

304
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,330
or whatever

305
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,089
and so I said you know hey know can you
can you check out this and had been

306
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:15,650
accepted

307
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,800
saturn ion I Excel spreadsheet source my
back is it hehehe updated Excel

308
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,810
spreadsheet islamic servings good

309
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,630
now this a technique that just if he
just knows I i release a new version of

310
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,060
the unicorn after hitting a car now
oxman in a second on

311
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,500
the Unicorn is a %ah partial injection
tool

312
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,459
if you didn't notice yesterday did a
update to it because I do a fantastic

313
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,570
night come up with something cool I
usually write

314
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,850
you know call code into it and I update
the code in a published author s world

315
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,440
on so to do with unicorn ominous enough
to merit that

316
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,380
also behavior of Sharia

317
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,380
be so unicorn

318
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,920
if enough for me

319
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,100
your PowerShell is like amazing right as
the course dance ever happened to both

320
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,310
the defensive side as well as completely
the opposite side as well

321
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,910
survivability on to do anything when I
called to say anything like I for the

322
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,889
bill to do any type of

323
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,250
recover mode command injection or remote
code execution

324
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,600
PowerShell is by far my go to you like
number one I don't drop binaries on

325
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,209
computers anymore I don't install
malware any think that I just use

326
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,630
PowerShell completely I'm even

327
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,260
touch you know you generally buyers
market power cells are most affected

328
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,040
and so this technique on in this you can
get this market upside as such I get a

329
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,029
comp such trusts act such get home

330
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,560
I uses an almost every single pants s
that I do so effective and what this

331
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,949
does is if Parcells installed which by
default it's going to be installed on

332
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:41,940
anything when is just an above anything

333
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,459
I'm Server 2003 service pack 2 but I
believe on but def by 2020 12th

334
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:51,360
and so a partial we can do is that you
can on basically called on at assemblies

335
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,490
on you know you have a full-fledged
programming language your fingertips

336
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,010
and we can do with this one is there's a
individual name at the greater that came

337
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,130
out the concept of being able to do you

338
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,589
job I me to show code injection inside
it a partial so many special code or any

339
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,980
show could you have assembly code

340
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,640
you can check directly into memory and
so I took that I rewrote it to wear on

341
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,120
doesn't call an x86 Dondria tax credits
compatible 64-bit and 32-bit not gonna

342
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,709
go on a detox is always our body

343
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,030
on but one site what's at once you run
this command

344
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,559
on executed and I i

345
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,079
it gives you a command a text file that
you can basically by copying patient

346
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,690
anywhere you have a command prompt a

347
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,080
so as important as you can about this
into Excel documents

348
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,320
you whenever you're sequence action you
can use this whenever you have a payload

349
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,169
can I use this

350
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,360
so anywhere that you have the ability to
when you compromise your system

351
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,000
to be able to run a command you can
execute this and it gives you a command

352
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,840
prompt and it doesn't touch desk it
doesn't

353
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,940
you do anything it doesn't make any
modifications are historical data

354
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,230
the only way to detect this is if you
were to be looking a memory friends

355
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,380
remember now says looking for mature

356
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,419
dropped my memory socially with this guy
looks like

357
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:02,970
was gonna go my IP address real quick
answers my IP

358
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:09,110
some 192 168 1 30 for 171 and I run
unicorn it's going to be a cent tax on

359
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,659
every call hacker tool estaba ASCII art

360
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,210
I'm so I put in a corner amazing our
address the runner

361
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,330
Paris aggressor as in Iraq I'll it's a
very big unicorn

362
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,630
so Iran unicorn I would ask for is the
payload the you want to specify some

363
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,799
this case riskin user a mess but payload

364
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,389
and then on the IP address and and so we
need the IP address of where r attacker

365
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:35,000
machine is at a frat Metasploit that's
our I'll host

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,929
and and the poor thing is communicate
with us on OK and then what was added

367
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:39,659
yesterday

368
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:43,990
I was in a proven onto the Mac attack so
this automatically generate macro curfew

369
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,909
the you can embed this into a Word
documents and a PowerPoint and Excel

370
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:48,899
documents

371
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:52,510
and I literally as soon as they open it
in a house at the new macros but few

372
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,240
do get free texts not a problem it's
going to inject PowerShell

373
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,529
on into memory without touching this is
not gonna do a dollar an act that's

374
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,139
gonna make a compromise machine

375
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,919
an impact them to get surround
anti-virus & and everything else out

376
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,289
there

377
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,820
I'm so I'm gonna run this really quick
ancestry 22

378
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,820
on Raza doing it guys are hard

379
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:21,490
summers gonna

380
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,440
first one now what's interesting about
this is that I was funny out whenever i

381
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,640
right tools I sometimes I forget to tell
my team is publish an Internet gonna pay

382
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,240
attention

383
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,270
Sollers outage in a black hair last year
and I was showing this exact emo

384
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,360
and other like and I'll teams have meat
is like when the heck did you release

385
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,740
this week it uses only forty different
anti-semite

386
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,200
autumn an anti-gay I'm sorry I forgot
but know why I saw everybody

387
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,110
up then here gives you the arm the
instructions on what you can do but you

388
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,780
notice it at it creates two files okay
creates a powershell underscore tax a

389
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,420
txt

390
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,179
thats order code: and asking to use
unicorn RC which is a or a car resource

391
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,340
file for Metasploit

392
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,760
on that's going to create our listeners
our listeners gonna you know be sitting

393
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,350
there waiting and waiting and waiting
for connection when for connection

394
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,070
we execute the command in Windows
machine and it can expect us know we

395
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,720
have a connection back and forth at the
door are good stuff summer Lodge menaced

396
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,370
by real quick

397
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,740
in order to do that just type MSF
Council space dash are and then unicorn

398
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,330
RC

399
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:27,330
and then I'm gonna go and open that the
code up now this is the command that

400
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,820
you're gonna run

401
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,040
now the corner right may look like a as
I can cook dinner whatever it saw its

402
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,410
base 64 encoded in the reason we do that
is a

403
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,410
I gave a talk at I'd like Def Con like
16 yr

404
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,950
for I think that I'm fortunate I
remember as when PowerShell beta first

405
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,179
came out it wasn't in any operating
system

406
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,570
no one to talk about your from like a
defensive or secure perspective

407
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,890
and I'm actually gonna claim to fame to
us of my career as being able to govern

408
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,580
talkin

409
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,600
about hacking power saws the first one
ever gonna do with Mike coworkers Josh

410
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,030
so we went up on stage during at Def Con
we talked about how you could have harsh

411
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,770
on to of course tougher released a %ah

412
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,040
a way to you I'm dump the Sam database
Europe are up our shells call paradigm

413
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,929
professed company

414
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,240
on but up rested like her shells and
things like that

415
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,000
on but it was a really cool way ought to
have partial 1i think so identified as

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,490
that

417
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,179
arm when when you use power shows were
called saw first Russian policies

418
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:23,179
and there's restricted under strict at
all signer notes I'm even in its most

419
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:26,850
restrictive sense if you have partial
lockdown to its most compartment a

420
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,950
potential capacity

421
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,390
you can still bypass all those execution
restriction policies regardless just

422
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,490
bypassing at the encoder command brown

423
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,470
her which is a built-in back door for
Microsoft so

424
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,400
you know basically be just passed this
and this code here has to be an AA

425
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,770
Microsoft specific format which is just
casita code in base64 encoded

426
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,870
base KB copy and paste this into a
command prompt Nuria Roca man execution

427
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,300
can inject into memory connect back and
you have access into the

428
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,309
entire computer so I'm going copy basis
for a quick

429
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,309
evidence

430
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,300
copy paste into

431
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,770
bronte right as I partial code I'm gonna
go I miss our listeners are a quick

432
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,800
get this he right

433
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,140
hit enter their show

434
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,840
can just a second text sec Amendola
belonging to pay and how

435
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,080
much to do it or I must have something
trigger

436
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,620
dork tower

437
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,620
and my network mister credit here

438
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:46,910
right and wrong 17 1

439
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,310
that's right well

440
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,090
this post work their leaders were

441
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,190
Paris a compliment sometimes there's a
long line of job in Misrata before

442
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,650
on but basically never shall there that
pops up now the second method you can

443
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,360
use

444
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,610
I'll show you this one network hurry but
this character

445
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:14,270
actually I can't and won't happen
assessing it before

446
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,419
yeah I like for our shows open that's
why you

447
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:20,390
or assessing before sidelights

448
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,770
30 different to should do

449
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,360
be again

450
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,360
me

451
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,460
I'll and other

452
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,059
so nearest magic the next morning you
also uses the

453
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,179
I A macro attack I get that work

454
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,230
so set up just specifying I am

455
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,260
the court the reverse and on the court

456
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,590
you specify macro n roll copy and and do
all the Mac record it for you and basic

457
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,649
I capture macro why wouldn't that work

458
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:16,929
gonna redo

459
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:22,010
has rebooted today some show in a season
on

460
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:28,450
another is generated here

461
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,610
belly fat again you Sears on a macro
code

462
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,840
and I need to do is in bed that into a
new macro

463
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,150
and then as soon as someone opens it
enables it to compromise the machine

464
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:44,680
some ish example that real quick as copy
this

465
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,890
I go into office here Avant that word

466
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,620
as an example which

467
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,470
and I

468
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,360
if not for mayor is using macros are you
have to enable on first and this is for

469
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,860
for Mac but to me if the same thing and
as well

470
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,400
obviously going to you on your
preferences sci-fi preferences

471
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,400
her work preferences you going sir I
hear you gonna ribbons

472
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,400
there's a job developer tab down here
that you have to add

473
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,990
wanna hear I want these ones yeah

474
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,310
where another artist thank you

475
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,860
Saturday highlighted and that gives you
an additional tab on to mess with macros

476
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,230
inside a meat ax our work

477
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,550
and seen as a pier Avenue Developer tab
so good Robert 7 have macros

478
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,980
and I do auto open as my name

479
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,910
and it creates during all this code here

480
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,630
pace of new stuff here then

481
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,320
and yet accident here and receiver
document

482
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,350
now

483
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,020
in this case but I save it on you and
miss you save it as a macro enabled

484
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,730
document

485
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,020
so da cam safe very good to go

486
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,740
you just created your your you know
fully malicious payload data soon as

487
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,130
they open it compromiser she know that
took like what

488
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,320
30 seconds are two minutes like that
right I'm so sorry to go up and what's

489
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,690
cool about this one is on

490
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,860
there's an individual that that sounds
emitted this %uh the Mac or PC

491
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,710
this is awesome I'm when he did that won
the cool things he did I just

492
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,930
are changed around a little bit when
they open up the %uh

493
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,240
document enable a box is gonna pop up in
the box I was gonna say critical

494
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,480
microsoft office air

495
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,580
as he this document appears to be
cropped missing critical rose in order

496
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,100
to you are properly open

497
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,530
our not gonna close application please
use a recovery are you know how we met

498
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,260
on recovering at

499
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,150
and actually goes in close the
application so the OpenOffice as a

500
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,570
spouse

501
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,120
you know it possible ices box is crafted
you had OK to close the whole

502
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,070
application so

503
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,410
people don't usually see what actually
occurred and actually compromises

504
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,400
machine you get access to the system

505
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,470
and all that good stuff couple minutes
to mess with us

506
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm a try that again across Africa know
it works

507
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,480
and i know i sacrifice that for chickens
the democrats earlier so

508
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,480
try us again so wanted to 168 134 171

509
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,300
134 I'll 170 my IP address changed when
I was doing the presentation

510
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:29,230
last post: do that was me

511
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,700
a record

512
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,660
was a major change

513
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,130
always well I am think what I to

514
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,200
see I did I

515
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,890
config as 171 my dive began as 170 like
literally they change it right in the

516
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,710
middle of me

517
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,590
but has a messed up go

518
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,340
now you are so handsome lowers against

mites Iron Man time whatever floats your
boat up

531
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:40,690
mister coming out a gym membership body
all

532
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,090
as they become 0 crawl started

533
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:51,090
are so much as loathsome gonna get my IP
addresses changed

534
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,770
on right

535
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,940
an Veritas

536
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,260
your show yea same here show again on

537
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,930
but super show also Metasploit based job
but anything that supports

538
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,050
%ah you know if you have any service and
the code you want to inject into member

539
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,960
you can use as it doesn't have to be a
mess quarter per

540
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,100
I could be any some because they want to
just take a look at the source input the

541
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,290
code and they're all that's you know
open source and everything

542
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,410
on but you know what I think that I
often use it on is a

543
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,840
three from the earth up yes exactly
estoy Mary's up for

544
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,590
I'll probably PS exec in Metasploit an
internationalist it's on its way if

545
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,500
you doing past the hasher she had normal
credentials you pass the hash the

546
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,780
victims and you can upload your own
binary

547
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,620
onto the file system in a compromiser a
problem with that is that you have to

548
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,500
either use your own custom binary

549
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,690
refuse the one has built in a mess but
it's getting a snack ban a virus

550
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,650
in RB Knowshon not some and sediments
were to actually are used as exec

551
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:58,650
scrambler quick

552
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,460
you actually have

553
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,200
of a drug that that's our show danced
she showed vast

554
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,910
there some some additional settings you
can do in their and I want the ones that

555
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,890
I often used by I'm gonna use this and I
want to use a %ah

556
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:17,050
a custom EXE is all you can do set space

557
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,930
XE Khong con custom you get the
passenger to a binary

558
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,000
internees a custom binder that you've
already packed instead on us both a mess

559
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,490
boy

560
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,530
I'm often times as get picked up by a
bee in things like that she can run your

561
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,210
own custom one

562
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,800
but this attack with ombre partial
injection I'm you can actually use the

563
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:39,800
on PS EXEC commands one which is a very
good model

564
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,720
as an auxiliary so he's ok sorry

565
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,570
admin SMB his exact

566
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:50,850
command you sure options on that on you
can actually do set

567
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,280
command you just paste the partial
injection coder

568
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,610
and then was also nice about his it
commands beer from a PS executive going

569
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,830
to one house at a time and I supports
our hosts

570
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,510
in this case P is a command supports our
hosts which your entire site imitations

571
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,520
seeking to spray PowerShell throughout
the whole never credentials and then you

572
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,470
to shelter any backup got 100 100 shells
from customers were

573
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,330
rear brake in an office tonight at 9
shows are on and again doesn't touch

574
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,120
destin trip anything you know it's a

575
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,860
complete the on you know harmless now as
far as hell bomb

576
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,160
traditional detection methods would
would typically see and was asked about

577
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,570
his ex man as well as it supports on
hash house

578
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,730
so for the S&P pasick just pace that
element and and John hash

579
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,520
and then boom you know you have access
to those are not the crack the ashes or

580
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,530
anything else is out there

581
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,890
he's all time and if you're familiar
thought the social engineering toolkit

582
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,550
on the sexy all built on the site
already I A

583
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:45,060
got senator yeah also so I

584
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,430
in this ocean here to look at I'm if you
go to option number two

585
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,370
you can just do number six and it'll do
anything for you to create the partial

586
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,200
injection Co for you in a crear
listeners we automatically

587
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,400
on middle on ask you the Rangers you
want to specify in detail ask you for

588
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,990
reading his name and/or password hash

589
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,920
general going to spray the on our free
on a Mac is ok creates all the stuff

590
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,380
really commands you need to use

591
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:13,380
icon doesn't automatically

592
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,740
so it was fun so that's that

593
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,890
VC on the arm the offense of Cyrus or in
the the purple team theme

594
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,429
those that knew so the one of our guys
rode II Jeffrey Walton

595
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:25,720
um who I'm it so-called ships

596
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,400
anti-semitism chipset I if you have an
expressway is open sources for the blue

597
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,890
team

598
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,440
and that was funny about these acronyms
is that you know you I think like these

599
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,640
acronyms are sophisticated like when
they come out on

600
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,980
well ships are we ended up are creating

601
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,890
on because one of the guys in the office
I'm we had a chips better at the Mexican

602
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,370
restaurant

603
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,070
see how many back to chip zucchini and
so you end up getting nine answer in a

604
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,210
tool after Mr caught chips but we can
find an acronym for C

605
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,530
I'm so into calling it ships because it
sounded kinda parity in america love an

606
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,350
acronym for that

607
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,470
that's how we can agree on her name
centrust the second it comes to our

608
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,990
tools

609
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,960
on but here you can see our ships is
kinda a blue team

610
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,050
effort where I it's a really easy Ruby
framework

611
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,679
and what happened is a lot to see
compromise an organization and you go

612
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,309
after 'em

613
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,840
know what happens is you compromise
wanna she wishes say it's a I use a

614
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,280
machine

615
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,470
right you get private escalation again
ministered about machine and you

616
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,500
you grab the using a password hashes of
that system a lot of times at local

617
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,020
minister counts as the same on that one
system

618
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,250
as it is in the rest the organization
right or you got compromise one server

619
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,970
a member server and then member service
administrator password is the same

620
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,309
across all the rest the

621
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,929
the service themselves very easy lateral
movement for us attackers

622
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:40,440
so we decided on the ship's fronts on as
a cream or architecture you could

623
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,070
support

624
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,740
that supports unique passwords her
implementation of a workstation or

625
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,350
server

626
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,420
or Linux machine or are we sports is
gone now

627
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm so you can do is is you deploy ships
server answer

628
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,660
no Ruby our web server that runs on
minutes you know it using cryptography

629
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,440
sound everything in August often

630
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,220
open source you can take a look at
yourself on there on the web server

631
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,990
and it supports extractor integration so
let's just say I'm a in a specific group

632
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,150
that has access to

633
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,540
workstations servers right I log on
using a password

634
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,800
I can then do a search for a specific
and point that I wanna login to

635
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,659
administrator

636
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,560
and has the unique password that gets
created every day inside there are you

637
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,300
have every hour 10 minutes very idea

638
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,600
what happens is you know it you makes
the password on every single machine

639
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,469
completely unique in a central I

640
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,480
essentially man is a

641
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,600
in the ship's infrastructure so it's an
points the server everything has a

642
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,690
completely unique

643
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,669
on local password needed us have to be
at the local admin could be any

644
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:35,440
passwords

645
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,179
on that our caps on those machines our
servers of and what's it what's

646
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,899
interesting is that the and points like

647
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,020
I what happens is it kicks off you know
a script that that that

648
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,580
I'm creates you know through server
policy whatever on creates the

649
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,820
the rotation of those passwords but
nothing's ever store on here

650
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,580
on that communicates the ship server it
generates unique password again using

651
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,290
narcotraffic sound you know up here geez
and everything in order to create all

652
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:58,710
that

653
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,910
and they automatically arm deploys that
new password to that individual system

654
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,609
and all the Sun you have unique on
implementation across your entire

655
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:06,340
environment

656
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,640
how we have this deployed are we seeing
customers apply this that have you know

657
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,619
twenty forty

658
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,720
50,000 m.sc ob so it's been deployed in
a very large scale below environment

659
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,230
already

660
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,420
our numbers cable environments are banks
have implemented this

661
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,310
on its really cool you know open source
projects %ah that's more the blue team

662
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,790
and trying to stop a lot of our pivoting
impose exportation serious

663
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,869
gonna look and feel

664
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,150
I will continue to get it get a better
as time goes on but that's kind of what

665
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,940
it looks like

666
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,990
as far as a general mom you know look
and feel to be able lookup job-specific

667
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,740
shields

668
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,800
and so on connectors can be written

669
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,250
there's a good documentation on how you
create a connector but all a

670
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,710
all it is is an ACPI ISPs request so
they really you just generated

671
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,440
chris-craft and yes supports its

672
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,710
yes we have catchers Rd for Linux for
you next for Windows

673
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,109
for a sax on and sis was re-written

674
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,859
that's your policy at a bit here
supports its BS calls you can have the

675
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,350
passwords be unique on this machine sign
has a scripting language that he be your

676
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,400
power shower

677
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,210
you know basher anything that can
support each yes you can create your own

678
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,450
connectors for

679
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:15,030
and have it automatically handle ob-gyn
follows back on the right team sign

680
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,440
iris im really stuck commenter
progresses H

681
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,270
I as a venue issue I have seen that lot
times the

682
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,330
of 1st Asia Metasploit I is fine but the
second stage and the beginning

683
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,400
%uh snagged especially like things
apollo autos & and things like that

684
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,680
observer told that saddam text message
was so code

685
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,320
it shows in the memory in it wraps
around an assist someone tells us a

686
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,150
shout the company

687
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm so it's an expert on all on trucking

688
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,840
process about open source you can see
that you don't spend a lot on that

689
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,820
artillery they haven't seen that saddam
it's an active honey pot again wore the

690
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,680
blue team side

691
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,190
I saw it so that I right job that
focuses on Aug

692
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,960
developing kinda honey pie
infrastructure that no can detect

693
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,500
attacks and from there on

694
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,750
you know I'm help are also does a file
monitoring

695
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,650
on all that good stuff on operating
system looks for you know of it as a

696
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,200
compromise on the system's

697
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,520
things like that you can see the ports
running their won the most recent things

698
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,980
that I at least versions

699
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,740
I was the originally created officer at
a point auto to servers and honey pots

700
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,110
I'm kinda all across the globe I got
some really weird places Donna Scott

701
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,340
there's gonna wear but %ah

702
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,510
are razor burn a credit card I know like
Russian signs must stop but %ah

703
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,640
butterworth I have on the GPS is now on
told you i think

704
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,070
but the but I have these on automatic
feeding back and you can actually

705
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,200
download speeds

706
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,390
route cycles out every two weeks serious
go to you by our defense I com slash

707
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,630
band as a txt

708
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,740
these are known IP addresses are that
Tom have you know that our attacker so

709
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,500
you get known

710
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,670
your feet so far different actors on
sensor deployment customers we get those

711
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,540
speeds as well

712
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,090
so you can a real time arm now says an
enzyme that we're doing the cancer

713
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,740
response

714
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,100
we automatically updates on the ballot
as well but also most recently I had on

715
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,900
additional feeds that according to their

716
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,490
ob so like I'm command control box arm
you know bad IP addresses and identify

717
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,270
bipedal Abu tracker

718
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,360
on a lotta love the mail code I P
blacklists it takes all those actor gets

719
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,880
back into balance as well see get a
pretty good she

720
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,280
on a la voz de France on active IP
addresses that are out there s

721
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,660
on for the most recent Roberson

722
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,840
working on it I

723
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,750
wanna listen next the next couple weeks
I'm actually finished with it I just

724
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,250
haven't had time to clean up the code is
it really ugly

725
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,300
and that there's never stops me for
leasing things on a wide is now but

726
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,510
on that practices framework I miss

727
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,260
to keep kinda are put into perspective
cemeteries Kelly Lenox are you know yet

728
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:41,900
i right

729
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,640
on callous phenomenal I use at all times
it's a great so on

730
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,720
but there's also things at that are not
sell the updated as fast as I would like

731
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,850
I'm like for example are the tools and
salsa specials like Metasploit or Satter

732
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,340
especially you know tools that I i
continue see often a regular basis

733
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,910
we also have internal tools on that we
use that any repositories for tarmac to

734
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,690
keep up to date like

735
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,170
larry one of our guys me up they want
this code bases and I remembered updated

736
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,720
and then I forget about it or whatever

737
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,930
so I I created a sink all the pen test
this framework

738
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,550
and it's a it's a mess plate feel aunt a
framework that allows pan testers

739
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,530
to create their own real kinda their own
tool sets no distributions

740
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:23,180
of four other teams and then share that
so that you can continuously keep other

741
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
stuff of the day

742
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,660
Aug and so like for example mom you know
when you go into it

743
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,480
you can add your own modules and you
want to be a programmer disregard your

744
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,330
modules religious create your own

745
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,500
I'll show you in a second but limits of
thirty seconds to 25 minutes maybe it's

746
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,270
a decree role model to create it

747
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,160
then your own tools and they're gone
repose or your own arm you ever

748
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,520
structure own tools Eagle Claw from the
rest world

749
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,030
an automatic keeps all her stuff up to
date real time I'll show you an example

750
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,810
this

751
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:56,420
so

752
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,920
to

753
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,670
for some Python as anything right on me
run again anything could have asked dr.

754
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,170
right and then so you get into PDF

755
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,690
and I make attacks were platform you're
on so if you're running Debian or Ubuntu

756
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,970
a red hat or whatever you end up running
a scheme to detect that platform

757
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:16,030
on a Mac the associate that with you
RPM's or whatever you're doing for

758
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,880
officer package management or for not
using it all of its thought boss up

759
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,270
early

760
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,260
but it's gotta that type you know to
question mark for help it'll tie

761
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,310
somebody options

762
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:29,790
beauty shops are some models can see
here some that have already written

763
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,990
arm but these are the tools that are out
there that I wanna keep up to date

764
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:37,500
as a mayor anywhere sir contesting with
backtrack RR while picture windows I was

765
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,160
right so ever remember the slash Penta
structuring

766
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,560
remiss the pan to structure a beginning
or a pata stretching back

767
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,910
okay here's a little sad I would use for
numeration results is a use for

768
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,930
exportation

769
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,240
well they they switch that around to
what's called deficits compliance which

770
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,390
is all other tools an hour are the
launchers are news or ban and the

771
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,000
date is actually in use or share to no
longer have those treacherous its kinda

772
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,070
you know we through the menu structures
and everything so I did as I I created

773
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,080
on recreate that pen to structure again

774
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,550
and I kept in line with the the
penetration testing executions tenors a

775
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,660
methodology for

776
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,640
or installs from but almost all these
things in different directories like

777
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,600
it'll start under

778
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,900
flash pen test slash
intelligence-gathering slash dictionary

779
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,110
no such ban te such intelligence young
century can I G

780
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,520
here's also was an April 10 offer models
already and wattle what this will do is

781
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,690
every time the run it

782
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,870
it is not there to install the first
time the run again if it's not there

783
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,730
automatically update all these tools for
real time so you have all the latest

784
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,690
crystals

785
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,490
on update your real time an industry out
using a modular

786
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:43,490
I read it yet really easy programming
language behind it

787
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,369
so

788
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:47,710
notice here that having broken down into
different categories so we have you know

789
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,859
exportation told us getting part6
petition you can is add a new tractor

790
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:51,839
gonna create your own like

791
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,819
day school stuff and make a directory it
automatically pick that up in a row grab

792
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:58,839
all the models inside our so-called
dynamic at all nappy imports in real

793
00:41:58,839 --> 00:41:59,400
time

794
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,200
and I say go to exploitation I'll show
you the model so here's a couple of

795
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,430
models here a FB

796
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,550
Metasploit ready nom on Sat responder

797
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,140
so vigorous Potter is open responder it
requires an author

798
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,050
okay are who wrote the model description
%uh the tall

799
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,140
what type of insulation scheme is going
to be get St Ann Arbor Street file

800
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,050
downloader support file downloading
download the files on a rabbit

801
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,260
repository location saw location

802
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,810
and then you know they are WN and I
create some called after commands

803
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:34,050
on which is like you know sometimes you
know when you download a file is not

804
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,420
just a script it's a national
application if the run you know

805
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,859
configure may cost of

806
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:41,490
after commander something that you can
run after you've downloaded the file

807
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,069
and automatically I'm do those commands
afterwards he can do installs things

808
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:47,890
like that seek a little crazy seem like
an easy way to create a model like you

809
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,430
know the dollar path location

810
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,359
they're just copy the same pace then and
it also takes about 30 seconds to a few

811
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,960
minutes that actually created

812
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,089
seeking Craig your own own modules your
own on you know are told to keep them

813
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:00,050
up-to-date real-time

814
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,540
and discuss how is it is like I do him
make sure my by PETA struck trees

815
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,449
you know clear

816
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:13,859
check like four times and I do an arm SR
star Treasury drescher to do that

817
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:19,009
on soyuz module was it did you install
or update all

818
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:23,910
to do both but jobs buddy like modules
are doing easy one assist you I unicorn

819
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,029
to complete its kinda working any defect
that's one thing and fix before I get

820
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:28,410
done

821
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,949
about the unicorn soyuz's module

822
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:36,759
and a show options you can see here on
acix polls the locations that you made

823
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,160
for that specific framework

824
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,599
then when I wanna go use it at a citron
gonna go on clone it

825
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,219
the bill is done another gonna bend the
structure is gonna be interposed

826
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:48,119
exportation

827
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,059
and I talk now this is how I keep it
up-to-date

828
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:57,349
I does it run again see automatically
notices that I already had installed it

829
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:58,809
goes on and on about the updates it

830
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,739
but you know you want to do this for
each individual tool right because that

831
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,809
kind if it's a purpose

832
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,349
so I do show options show model sorry

833
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,969
I do use modules

834
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:15,330
stall ok

835
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:19,040
cycle 3 mission at all it's all secretly
have installed a reader a in solder be

836
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,850
updated so

837
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,430
guess the easy way to can essentially
manage all the tools you typically use a

838
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,430
pen tester

839
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,510
I make sure they're all there and time
management ca going to be on a couple

840
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,080
weeks

841
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,530
prior week an airplane right martin here
so probably

842
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:40,020
koran airplane hell ASI no set obvious
equal to or

843
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,200
arm I'm almost all aversion 631 there is
a that last version 63 IRI hold a large

844
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,480
portion the code like i dont got rid of
like

845
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,350
probably around two thousand lines all
coterie wrote it on because it was just

846
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,900
so called need to rewrite it

847
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,190
I'll but Saab after my son right
governor three thousand at like

848
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:02,560
on the icon 50 on such a good day um but
I also created a lot of different that's

849
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,040
for the payload delivery systems

850
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,600
of for example I meant the smart
selection now where are the compromise

851
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,570
for the job app let

852
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,660
protect the most reliable exportation
technique on the actual operating system

853
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,680
and drop it there

854
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,910
and it won't drop any other methods and
this is the text that are successful

855
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,970
so for example if it does Powershot
quotation no compromise that and won't

856
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,660
drop binaries on top of that comment and
the prominence

857
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,410
I'm working on a new hehe action
technique through an explorer

858
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,670
of the other ones I had a fix but about
to introduce the new one man you could I

859
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,070
see

860
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:35,980
matches new bugs obstetrical others a
unicorn Rd

861
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,010
already passed that not really row

862
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,230
there's a good blog post that one of our
guys Larry just did are many wrote some

863
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,130
code 42

864
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,110
which is our when you compromise a job
organization right

865
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,510
that the biggest thing that we look for
is is privileged accounts or

866
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,950
people that are ministry tarzana
machines he is usually a lot times if

867
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,510
you go to the ministers machine

868
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,130
your eighty may have a Kerberos token
that we can impersonate or B they might

869
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,330
have credentials on a system that we can
use in order to do it

870
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:05,560
I will they rewrote is a an automated
way I'm the sweep the whole network

871
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,610
looking for Prabhas tokens Boker plus
tokens anchor text passwords

872
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,900
obstetric primi cats uses an
undocumented feature the alsace

873
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,240
occurred II something called double
digest extract clear text password

874
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,740
remembering

875
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,480
of it does all that for instance the
whole networking and gives you basically

876
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,390
a tax file

877
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,230
all the credit in the privileges that
they have and it'll hunt for specific

878
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,430
tokens that maybe

879
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,330
elevated

880
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,540
give you those tokens that you can use
those tokens on Tel Aviv

881
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,950
missions in an environment for lateral
movement this is pastor hunter

882
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,960
this is go through and dog I got your
passwords

883
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,890
others also token hunters well I was a
blog post a bond that we just google

884
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,620
of you know pastor hunter and trust that
sack you'll find it oz recent blog post

885
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,800
we did in January but

886
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,110
act wash if you all stops away media so
that was our

887
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,530
I was a lot lot of no offense and
defensive type stuff me know it's

888
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,610
interesting at the La those attacks that
we do

889
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,750
I mean the the the techniques I get

890
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,320
access into environment isn't
sophisticated right if I

891
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,510
if I compromise one machine and that one
machine can only communicate I like 18

892
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,160
443 to the data center

893
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,190
and to not any other people next to them
like new workstations

894
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,050
is a very hard for me to pivot in export
the rest the environment yes

895
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,160
right sonar segmentation alone makes it
much more difficult for me as an

896
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,150
attacker

897
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:26,830
to compromise arrest an organization I'm
doing things like removing a minister

898
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,050
Paul writes from users

899
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,710
no probs escalation is a very
challenging one obvious you're fully

900
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,650
passion up to date it takes a little
while for me to get through it again

901
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,660
writer make it impervious portray make
it a lot harder sure you can disallow

902
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,250
PowerShell from regular users

903
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:45,070
our shows how one the most used methods
right now you have Server 2008 or Bobby

904
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,400
Heslin called app Locker

905
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,590
ap lot yess offer such a party issue but
ap lockers basically application

906
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,130
whitelisting built into Windows for you

907
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,990
you can specify a disallow PowerShell
for all users

908
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,780
so no user does are impartial it doesn't
work as a no reserve ever need is

909
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,390
partial

910
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,330
no right that's one thing we should be
stopping right now is dis my

911
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,330
partial-birth already a user population

912
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,830
you can also do %ah ninety percent a
most power

913
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:14,020
sections use a top drudgery to drop an
hour into just literally I current you

914
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,370
know I'm

915
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,450
with allies are for my you're being
asked when I E the dollar the stager

916
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,630
gets dropped into the tent rectory then
it gets execute from there

917
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,040
with ap locker you disallow execute it
was in the contractor is not granted a

918
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,740
couple coming applications are still

919
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,930
you sell a Java for example is at the
white list those on but aside from those

920
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,400
I mean no literally

921
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,380
disallow those you stop ninety percent
in our factions any stop our shawndresh

922
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,710
in which the 10 most prominent I
affectionate

923
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,030
advertising see other so those are two
things you can do right now the little

924
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,730
the hanger

925
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,980
allowed the something which this is the
other by those two things alone

926
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,369
stops at like to stop by

927
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,369
as by actually without us up that that's
I am

928
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:55,099
a macro injection to just by doing this
we think through things

929
00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:00,369
I'll you don't you shut down right basic
principles

930
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:03,599
minimize the damage like data center
segmentation does a normal user ever

931
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,359
need to communicate on Oracle ports are
armed Microsoft segal courts or anything

932
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,740
like that no or hate so why do we have
to open to our sales force

933
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,200
walking our sales force communicate on
Microsoft's Eagles when I compromise one

934
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,740
box

935
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,099
as in the past the for got the change
has direct access from sales machine

936
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:22,180
doesn't make any sense right
minimisation a porter protocols you stop

937
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,380
here's one thing to be careful of my
talked about like APT's and and you know

938
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,060
hackers breaking an amusing all the
sophistication

939
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,240
as if you folks in this industry right
now and in the security issue that are

940
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,380
prominent people

941
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,510
on they're talking about adversarial
simulation as a message for trying to

942
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,869
on understand how attackers work that's
fine and dandy if your program is at a

943
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,810
point to handle adversarial simulation

944
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:48,040
and let's talk about adversary summation
is basically trying to you on

945
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,839
%uh mimic an advanced attacker advanced
persistent threat right

946
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,700
well what people fail to realize is that
advanced persistent threats

947
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,220
like most to them like ninety-nine
percent the group are too terrible at

948
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,760
hacking

949
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,540
her absolute horrible using basic stuff
to resent same stuff to use on a regular

950
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,310
basis there's nothing advanced about
that now granted

951
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,380
every little group Hazare they're
awesome rock stars right that have a

952
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,950
user days are burned her when does your
days things like that a very small group

953
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,599
is targeting government contractors and
things like that for intelligence

954
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,160
purposes

955
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,020
the not burning oh days on Fortune 1000
companies it's not doing it messes

956
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,250
you know I'm military or government
related so

957
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,460
these advanced very %ah simulations I
should do know a lot of harm I got one

958
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,349
the biggest ones that your heroes like

959
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:32,680
you need to simulate the the curb rose
gold ticket because that's going to be

960
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,200
one in advance actors gonna do to

961
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,000
as a man you still have password one is
most in your path for thirty percent or

962
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,500
population every user accounts

963
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,890
the last thing you need to be worrying
about is golden tickets trust me

964
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,190
get nothing to worry about you know
where your pastor ones first re:

965
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,910
or that Ms 167 it's still on your
environment you have a segment of you

966
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,910
can get all your thing or the 2003
server their passion two years because

967
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:53,530
the business

968
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,470
let you those are the things that you
need to focus on not the golden ticket

969
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,160
right seem to be careful of what type of
level have assessment you get

970
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,910
you need a simulated vans right actors
burnings your days in a requirements

971
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,530
because

972
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,440
that want all that you just buy you need
to show value on right because just

973
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,840
bought a fire I see need to make sure
fire as actually protecting its ABT's

974
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,270
when

975
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,350
you know the the passer for the fire I
serve as pastor one

976
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,400
right so those are things that we need
to focus on

977
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,610
instead of focusing on these advanced
things that are out there also started

978
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,130
the years

979
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,550
on there's a major pandemic right now
around up

980
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,020
up %uh the youth when it comes to bring
it on an issue what

981
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,210
what happen is that the skirting trigger
sooth so fast

982
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:37,300
the people that had a lot of arm
experience

983
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,710
you know it's already very quickly any
credence gap in the middle

984
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,100
where there's people with no experience
right many people with you know no

985
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,820
experience that people with a lot of
experience

986
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,810
and so is this gap in our companies like
hey I need somebody with experience and

987
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,160
i wanna hire them but there's no one to
fill those shoes

988
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,750
and so they don't make investment on new
folks coming its initiative and focus on

989
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,310
the people that know stuff it's a
ministry so there's this gap in between

990
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,090
right now

991
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,890
on the really have to fill and you know
it's interesting because you know a lot

992
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,750
of schools near focus on teaching
relevant topics

993
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,540
around security I'm around you know
whatever did if its penetration testing

994
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,890
rx for research or

995
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:15,110
SF response you know those topics need
to be relevant and up-to-date

996
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,120
I with what's actually happening out
there also knocking ever fill that gap

997
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:18,830
out there

998
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:24,320
on there's a individual um name model
Paul has his son is Ruben is I got he's

999
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,080
a nine-year-old

1000
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,620
and I we had rubin over at Derby Conn
and your room and I'm sitting on a nice

1001
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,670
gonna go eyes went to the class into the
support monica is a nice guy and

1002
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:32,530
everything i said im

1003
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,660
sit down and I'm United hadn't
experienced in you know this nine year

1004
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,320
before he gets on stage in ok to give us
by the Derby Conn

1005
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,100
he gets up on their knees use and said
he's back into computer system a fully

1006
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,910
passion is aimed at breaking anything
Scott shells and everything like

1007
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,500
wall that's awesome right and so
everyone just keynote are saying

1008
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,470
like you know there was one other big
you know talks are say when attacking

1009
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,540
the computer system so

1010
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,380
you know it the we gotta teach our youth
rate we're going through things and

1011
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,420
doing things gets the most important one

1012
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,510
I it's really really happening out there

1013
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,800
and that's really all I got many
questions

1014
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,030
brenner

1015
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,370
talk to start talking last

1016
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:17,370
at two cups of coffee so that's that's
better me testing framework

1017
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,690
yep

1018
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:29,630
yep actually yeah I know I am

1019
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,830
I gotta run running an airplane ride one
time sort our

1020
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,220
as money what's funny is like a

1021
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,760
whenever I i cud projects I call get
like

1022
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,560
seventy eighty percent on the project
that I forget about it and I i don't

1023
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,830
touch of like two years the Mac OS or
cocoa he rushed by finishes up

1024
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,060
and select mature progress is a shy
written i three years ago

1025
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,220
and totally forgot about it and then I
am I going to sign a pen test we did I

1026
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,340
write something about that I

1027
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,360
then grabbing for my folder like looking
for all the code I call this new

1028
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,190
collection published

1029
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,220
their community so that I publish and I
forget about it so actually have a

1030
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:06,130
folder messenger

1031
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,450
just for here this is all my life oh yes
getting

1032
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,310
well that secret for

1033
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:17,550
to school right here this is all the
cost of

1034
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:21,070
that i really wanna release but every
literary by blow up the internet types

1035
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:21,460
of

1036
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,990
so I don't know this guy because the the
Internet can handle its like

1037
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:28,230
one other things that I wrote is a way
to do better progress H

1038
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,340
over a CPS and its proxy where so I
clearly can't on all

1039
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:35,230
you know but super traffic over SSH over
its PS other networking is falling crop

1040
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:35,680
the right

1041
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,480
without blocked the internet so you know
I don't wanna really seconds gonna blow

1042
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,520
DNS is a lot of stuff in this tough
order

1043
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,290
data is like really cool but I just
can't use it for probably another like

1044
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,619
three or four or five years

1045
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:49,330
so I forget about my call mister
