1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,280
in the pope's renewing its are with our
talk

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,719
I'm son Jordan I am

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,640
in Somerville were both digital
forensics majors at Marshall University

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,490
and for your students I'll

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,600
so we created a networks Cal

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,300
Twitter handle you have any questions
comments concerns you actually

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,439
tweet at us yeah it's a pretty quick

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm it's a good way to keep keep in
touch

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,140
if you have questions a my name Shawn
Jordan there's that word

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,040
handle I graduate this may you home
inspections on a

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,820
as I like a side business a didn't know
anything about by

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,500
going on into the said and

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,539
there's much to handle I'm pretty proud
of it because it was there um

14
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,600
I work as servers last post: latest Asia

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,119
so if you ever wanna your Chinese Pixar

16
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,130
donesies on Third Avenue see

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,229
sport at that

18
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:17,170
I

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,619
for we get started talking about every
step we like to give a special shout out

20
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:21,490
to people

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,600
funded us including martian ever see in
college science

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,020
the Dow Chemical Corporation

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,520
and capitol building

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,189
and we were actually able to present
their months ago

25
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,659
his very very very is big privilege to

26
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,549
we actually got to me while the Dell now
guys

27
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,110
doctor about networks Cal he was
fascinated with that

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,409
so think they're gonna keep investing
money

29
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,950
in the stem grant so fellow students
keep applying

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,030
mmm and then special thanks to bill

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,960
he kinda issued the question that
started all over

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,810
and helped us get a grant things like
that so now

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,869
networks cal

34
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,819
so first thing I talk about us lie

35
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,920
that we even do that what is the need
networks cow

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,079
and one other reason says there's been
an emphasis on parameter

37
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,120
defenses so we have our firewalls are
blinking boxes

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,060
on the edge in the network but nothing
inside so

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,530
order you know if there is something
inside it costs a lot of money

40
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,069
so we wanted to take something that you
could deploy

41
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,780
across the network and report centrally
up

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,030
talk about cost this is open source and
we ended up a

43
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,810
keeping the cost fairly low and then we
wanted something that was easy to set up

44
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,379
to you

45
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,480
SEM am what it is

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,139
it's a he's a state kennedy's artillery
that

47
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,200
IDS and honey pot

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,480
adds an additional the fence layered

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,970
additional layer of defense under the
network we have a

50
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,810
last

51
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,200
the subnets report sexually so the
skylight

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,680
how it has up lol that report back

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,400
server servers written in Python second
really run on anything

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,540
but I we've been these are as great by
stay the course

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,750
thus we have like 20 raspberry PIs so

56
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,040
it was just what we had and
eighteen-year

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,599
arts right art side iight for a good
start with this part might give a

58
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,980
special shout out to the actors for
charity

59
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,440
and their record by design that we based
I think we have one going on now

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,910
we base our design of the and

61
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,989
it's able to survive in

62
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,540
mall school like environments and its
water

63
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,739
we made to be waterproof dustproof and

64
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,920
basically can store it wherever you need
to do in forget about it

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,120
art or acquired tools

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,549
and here's %uh parts is that we have

67
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,730
you can find them all on Amazon their
all very cheap very

68
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,220
easy to order and have shipped to your
house

69
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,530
on

70
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,669
yet this is what I am

71
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,000
your think they're still

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
they only close a thousand store say no
well

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,720
I guess they did declare and yet hands
for

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,300
deftly Amazon alright is there a check
Amazon for everything

75
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,500
a there's a picture of our

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,840
designed to be used we have the LCD
screen to display

77
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,289
the IP address and whether the server or
artillery is running

78
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,320
on the device the server will

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,270
pick up all the communications from the
nodes across a network

80
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,650
we added the button in order to turn

81
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,880
the pie on and off and run the scripts
that way doesn't

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,150
does it I'll shutdown

83
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,470
like in them wrong way in that picture
is the raw

84
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,470
the raspberry the plus

85
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,320
the place

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,120
the only difference is it really is the
smaller SD card in

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,460
more processing power we haven't played
around with the

88
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,080
the Raspberry Pi in Syria yeah but it's
cut off

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
quantum processor but quad processor
your

90
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,480
ancestry here I caught him on the line
last Aug

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,790
am yes okay

92
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,070
but yeah but it's all the same price 35
bucks

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,740
arm the cool part is its able to be
built for under 150 dollars

94
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,750
and actually saves a lot rebuild the
second

95
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,020
machine because you have a lot of the
parts left over the first bill

96
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,990
safety bill to which me it depends on
your network configuration you're

97
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,720
looking at about

98
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,710
C 120 bucks and what what that is

99
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,080
get you Rs 35 server and a raspberry PIs

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,530
a honey pot IDS so

101
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,560
gender but compared the I looked online

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,390
last night and they were 5 10,000 this
is all open source

103
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,590
available on upset what and then here's
the

104
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,000
price break now we also have a how-to
guide its

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,190
available on up actually download it for
you got some rights whatsoever

106
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,250
you 1

107
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,570
so this is available already up on get
up

108
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,870
has noms the breakdown interstate
minutes

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,860
how we built the in the air where drill
holes

110
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,180
how to cut how we cut the plexi shortly
I'll

111
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,760
learned early on you don't use a dremel
on plexiglass Hill Ottawa

112
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,380
up you still the building Phil funny
afterwards assists not good

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,460
yeah if we had to take a break after
then at the church we built them in

114
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,790
it wasn't really happy that she answers
he left that this will say if that's

115
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,120
that you know how it went about

116
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,520
bill that a also give you the commands
and

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,870
late so this is already up available on
get up

118
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,860
so its get have slashed networks Cal

119
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,670
its yet no proper problem in

120
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,870
and there's also an would include the
wiring diagram

121
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,080
the LCD but it's available on a a
deferred

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,770
you don't have to worry about the
software side assist

123
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,380
watch flood gates where also bill tell
you

124
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,720
he gave me wonder bill right but
dyslexia kicked in

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,830
love him possible

126
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,550
up he

127
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,430
likely it's ten dollars ugly we were
well

128
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,180
on it so we had more multiple me
Raspberry Pi semester out with and also

129
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,630
are happy to announce

130
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,020
a we're actually gonna be building there
regardless you're so you can come

131
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,270
all what you do other grill plexiglas

132
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,870
the plexi glass cutter sessions

133
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,100
come join us we're gonna set them up or
going outside a mosque so

134
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,860
will do it the right way ship then we're
gonna go over

135
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,120
suffers it again special thanks to Dave
Kennedy who is this year

136
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,650
before he gave his talk about artillery
explain it way there than we could ever

137
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,030
ok to achieve but looking at his arm

138
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,030
open source software taught us how to
use Python

139
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,650
in this way and also it's interesting
team

140
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,800
and I guess binary defense and there's a
get up again

141
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,570
if you for missed it the first time is
right there gives you all the

142
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,770
instructions on how to download the
software in

143
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,080
installed onto the Raspberry Pi zur
anything really that you wanna use

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,810
and organic get through it the program

145
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,650
tag get their house set up cuz like a
the gold that's

146
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,810
is to make a open source where anyone
can take it and run so we're gonna

147
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,330
I'm get you code out structure and that
way if you guys wanna take it deploy it

148
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,920
you can do things with the maybe we
didn't think up for

149
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,650
you know do you cut some things like
that I'm and I talked to conceal that

150
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,540
one point about

151
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,840
getting it to top-tier firewall

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,990
maybe walking things doing things like
that so

153
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,990
everyone make opens

154
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,130
you your tap the like that they are
noticing your network a

155
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,899
Scout setup you have a for older sup

156
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,200
start-up the source in the website I'll

157
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,270
all this report back to that server that
server generates

158
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,680
a a table with all the incidences

159
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,760
so come a then we have your setup we
actually am

160
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,130
after we built the scripts we found out
that's really hard

161
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,399
you are a to get it all setup so we
gonna

162
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,890
a simple setup script so that solves
everything or you're the only thing you

163
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,620
have to do is tell your clients

164
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,180
IP address server and you're done so we
want to make it super easy

165
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,670
a set up there some controllers for like
the shutdown button

166
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,240
LCD controller we also have a
configuration file inside

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,580
which is where you point the server

168
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,660
than a man's gotta go over the server
part

169
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,990
right we also went to point out that

170
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,290
one of our clients said called a central
point I'm

171
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,820
they tried to set up on artillery on the
server

172
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,690
which made not work so if you ever wanna
download

173
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,279
or use that worked out be sure that the
server doesn't have are jewelers taught

174
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,579
on its sister

175
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:10,050
recording device alright use the Python
script days to build the

176
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,640
server I opened TCP connection

177
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,990
with all the other nodes able to connect

178
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,500
I'll kid communicate with up to four

179
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,440
different ones at a time it can be
increase to up to about 10 I do believe

180
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,259
and actually

181
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,549
the MySQL database inhabited

182
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,979
the the logs as they came over the
network

183
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:42,739
and then this user table was inhabited

184
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:45,779
directly close at the database and

185
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:51,519
uploaded it to the website Rd

186
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,109
like client was kinda a

187
00:11:55,109 --> 00:12:00,509
were my kid I guess so what this does is
it creates the

188
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:04,229
networks can make sure it's it's
installed and then in the late Bill

189
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,689
actually checked the log file

190
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:10,999
um I believe you can set anytime you
want I think it's up for a 10

191
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,589
are a minute so every minute the saint
exercise log pile

192
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:19,019
if you have something written to the log
its gonna send it out to the server

193
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,499
and I we set that 10 a bets

194
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:26,199
and mean so that that's anything like it
threatened to it

195
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,919
and then we had a um then we have it

196
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,449
connect to the server central also
whatever's in there it sends

197
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:37,769
and then it tries that for so if it's
not able to connect to the server

198
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,129
it won't erase the log will keep it
until I can actually connect

199
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:46,529
and if there's any airs anything we
print that out

200
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:51,209
and then I i must say the good send a
server script Lee bill

201
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,889
so it's just something really easy opens
a socket connects the port

202
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,899
sense the file the log path

203
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,640
and then it closes at so and some other

204
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,830
challenges some we ran into you

205
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,470
when we started this project 18 had just
did an independent study on Python

206
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,980
I didn't even know Python like I was
like that's language or business um

207
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,040
likely and I took Dave Kennedy scared
from artillery and pretty much studied

208
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,730
until

209
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,220
understood the syntax and all that stuff
and then we ran with that

210
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,790
am we also ran into the

211
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,920
IP address not shut down so if you tried
to do a port scan

212
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,420
running artillery it will catch you know
block you

213
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,240
and then you your IP address that your
blocks he can't SSH or anything into it

214
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,990
sowwy built in the LCD screen and out

215
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,590
well days I'll show you the status up
the server and the client I'll actually

216
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,450
tell you if the

217
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,690
processes running and also tell you that
the address and then the shutdown button

218
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,810
if for some reason you have to do
maintenance and supple in the flood

219
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,810
gonna a button in there so you can turn
down properly dole

220
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,050
perk that seek art a

221
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,080
another thing funding we rain and tears
artillery logging

222
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,120
so we started the project are telling us
mister dialogue

223
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,690
all the events that happen and their
space already have the server function

224
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,370
writer San a.m. we couldn't get it to
work

225
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,910
so what we ended up doing is a I create
a script

226
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,710
searchers a a

227
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,790
artillery file for the sender

228
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,750
the create law and I would inject code
under ni

229
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,780
that would create another long in our
directory

230
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,820
and that we'd actually have all the
events

231
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,070
already recorded ready to go a

232
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,070
says pretty neat here's the

233
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,540
how we answer to that so luck ever hear

234
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,430
so it modifies artillery file

235
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,180
opens it up and I'm looks through the
whole file

236
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,010
adds a underneath a underneath the

237
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,490
I'm code and then it's called warned the
good guys is what are

238
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,339
date can we put in there so will search

239
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,970
inject the code and then save

240
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,859
the file so you up when you're on
artillery and actually runs our code

241
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:25,549
a a low but other and other that was one
way we fix it

242
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,939
him

243
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:35,939
alright on this next I we're gonna go
back to the server arm

244
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:40,009
we are trying to find out what's ever
work best for raspberry PIs

245
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:45,679
and we found that the Linux Apache MySQL
and PHP

246
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,609
arm the open source software for the
servers work the best for us

247
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:53,479
in this instance arm there may be others
out there that work better

248
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:57,319
again that's what if their contact
information just in case like you guys

249
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,659
knew anything else a.m. lead to get in
contact with us

250
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,429
um the setup was

251
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:08,149
it's not difficult per se but we try to
make it as come

252
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,759
as a easy as possible and we went to
give

253
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,979
a special things to just poor we found
him on get up he

254
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:19,519
gave it was a code that used to you

255
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,279
downloader are set up the script else
are set up they'll Sanskrit for you

256
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,289
automatically

257
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:28,470
so without him widow what I've been
working on this for another

258
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,109
couple weeks at least sale I can

259
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:36,169
were the first time we got this time we
gave it to bill

260
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:40,049
I was like filling up to do yet to do
these ten steps

261
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:44,609
and a you know bills like

262
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:48,589
students work will ADHD woodall we miss
part of the steps within

263
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:52,579
so there's this problem getting it setup
sounds like you know what bill inspired

264
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,470
me to

265
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,559
right and install script Ohio make it
really easy %uh

266
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,809
make a bill proof yet gonna lesser

267
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,679
the moral this teen's mother is make it
bill priest but

268
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,129
so well it is we set up artillery

269
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,169
at ask you what you wanted a sick
actually set up a server

270
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:16,049
you get set up a client I or you can

271
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,089
exit or uninstall you can uninstall
networks cal

272
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,280
and then you also does have the X option
in case you get loose

273
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,940
what to run it but are so

274
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,660
run so does the options and then here's
what then saw looks like so if you pick

275
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,130
a

276
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,510
option to you here you can see that a we
kill artillery

277
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,860
we moved into its own folder and then we
insult

278
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,110
a GPIO which is what he is for the LCD
screen

279
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,310
and not button so damn lies that for
Python

280
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,970
when we get there we modify artillery
and then our

281
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,340
and then

282
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,150
I'm there was the sub part where a I
couldn't get

283
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,640
I'm we ran and its grips a candy like a
service

284
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,049
our networks calstart our scouts top all
that stuff I can get them to work

285
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:08,110
set like a day trying to figure it out

286
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,059
and I don't know there's too many
programmers but then you realize its

287
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:12,880
permissions

288
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,880
and you just wanna cry because you're
like us today trying to get this thing

289
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,789
to work

290
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,120
and yes so

291
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,539
appear yeah ran into permission problems

292
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,220
and on the server that's where the just
four script came and I'm

293
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,960
forget up we r he and lets it has a
automated land install

294
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,020
so we plug that in and then a is pretty
easy to create the server as well

295
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,690
and then to uninstall it just gets there
and deletes all the files

296
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,440
its which

297
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,820
then there's the permissions that I just
remember leaving that day and I was like

298
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,440
man I don't understand I was like yeah

299
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,440
I a teacher middle school kids Python I
found a mean it's like a

300
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,130
I don't know why this code works like
the furious pace or whatever

301
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,010
that's like I don't understand why it
doesn't work you have both sides

302
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,260
and then thats uninstall

303
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,840
and I'll years

304
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,940
so your dollars are

305
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,149
upset way all you really have to do is
type in a terminal command and I'll give

306
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:27,690
you

307
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,210
he all the scripts you need for either
the client side

308
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,049
or the server node soon

309
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,860
says something like I am

310
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,929
else the website is all the MySQL

311
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:46,299
almonds setup on the server you don't
have to do

312
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,220
anything so when you're running the
setup script there's no need to worry

313
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,179
about your sector

314
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:55,390
server configuration anything like that
we spied on

315
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,059
automated all other so when you take
your little

316
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,610
yellow box like it then I'm

317
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,410
he just install what you want

318
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,300
how to fill I'm they set the goal
simplicity and this is kinda like the

319
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,550
setup so once you get it off a guitar

320
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,930
you run the

321
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,670
setup that workout set up measure
options you just take it and then you

322
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,340
let it run

323
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,750
if you do the server does take like 30
minutes thing I tell you go get a cup of

324
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,520
coffee

325
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,780
you know enjoy life's and then

326
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,240
you have to you tell each

327
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,070
individual client node the server
address love

328
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,160
this a server I am chard

329
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,590
the server pie so that way they can
report back century to it in

330
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,670
update the website so that's just what
they can take files for

331
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,790
as you can see here he just a can edit
it with your favorite text editor

332
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,060
change the IP address and then we're
gonna

333
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,180
deal slide a it

334
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:08,180
action here is here this is a

335
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,410
the website on the server and I did a
port scan

336
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:17,310
season my Mac takes a couple seconds to
get the

337
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:24,310
a log data now

338
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,100
and after waiting about 10 seconds

339
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,140
it updates automatically another five
seconds

340
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,750
as you can see it tells you the attack
number

341
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,820
there you go Ulm the time the attack

342
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,290
and a message does the alert status

343
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,100
what happened and hopefully what you
need to do to fix it

344
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,400
like generally don't wanna see anything
on the table

345
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,410
H it's all about you know making sure
that no one is doing anything

346
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,530
um on and inside your networks are
generally that tables empty

347
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,900
and that's a good thing for another
thing is I am

348
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,240
ill tell you that the address that
picked up so they'll tell you

349
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,180
where your incident is so find that
computer

350
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,880
or from your network and then a

351
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,460
highly we're gonna hang over the future

352
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,010
network scale there's a lot of things
that need to be done by some security on

353
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,960
the server side

354
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,090
%um even some PHP ramps and stuff like
that

355
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,280
there's also some ideas that a

356
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,820
expanding Italian no bill can talk about
maybe making it the there

357
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,480
it wasn't just respond it would also

358
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,820
kinda like figure more out I guess a.m.

359
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,130
yeah

360
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,850
home his side

361
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,610
za hopefully mean being free still in
future

362
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,750
we came into contact with some people
they want to use it Encana privatize it

363
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,210
that was a really are dr. deal was to
you keep it free to the public just in

364
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,950
case a any small businesses

365
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,890
or local corporations when tip like an
actual air defense for

366
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,570
basically for free cuz we landed
appealing to keep it for reasons who is

367
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,770
open source from ghetto

368
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,830
uses be at which point a nature's

369
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,320
still that way and nothing is this is
that like a

370
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,920
and when we spoke at Terry Connor we're
kinda

371
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,410
trolling a little bit I guess the target
wish they would have had it not all that

372
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,150
stuff but

373
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,590
a honestly the the goal this data later

374
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,400
just another I'm you know someone that
can identify an attack at someone's on

375
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,750
your network you wanna know

376
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,000
goes back to like Dave Kennedy talking
about the lutein

377
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,710
like a lot of people are making red team
tools week we really need more

378
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,250
lutein polls T displaced identify if
someone

379
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,580
has made in your network and when we're
talking to the dow guy we

380
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,280
we compared this to you mean this is the
buoy system

381
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,540
on the Pacific coast you have a tsunami
you should get some reading back

382
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,160
a something's happening you need to look
at let's

383
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,210
a and that's the goal this is we what we
wanted something

384
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,370
that was easy cheap he had put out

385
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,440
you know the past thirty five dollars a
module

386
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,120
so something goes bad and it's not you
know

387
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,790
a thousand dollars to repair this you
can replace sd card on

388
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,640
10 seconds with another ten dollar micro
SD

389
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,370
you can buy a pie for 35 so

390
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,840
you know we're not no it wasn't
something know you know we want to make

391
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,160
some extent something that we can make
tons of money off we wanted us to go out

392
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,090
in the community

393
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,400
and really be a benefit

394
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,560
what that were will take questions and
it's a shortstop

395
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:00,210
apologize that's is less out barry Kelly
had like 20 minutes for questions

396
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:07,210
yeah bill he

397
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,100
and there with some

398
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,780
the weekend of Sept 26 cuz I that's my
birthday so I'll be down there

399
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,950
and I don't know the Casa training I
don't think they've announce it

400
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,200
but it is there's 15 slots

401
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,420
for training and they had 76 applicants

402
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,400
so very fortunate to get selected

403
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,470
and we like to encourage people to get a
lot of fun very connors

404
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,680
an awesome culprits oregon is awesome
today

405
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:53,680
family-friendly environment K yes yes

406
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,400
so you know it's coming every aspect I
love it well yeah

407
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,900
and you get a bag at your table

408
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,110
yeah anyone else having questions

409
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:17,110
that's the idea what we really want to
take it

410
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,300
there some improvements that need to be
made like that on the security side

411
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,670
and there's some ideas that week Adam as
we talk to use that land wasn't

412
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,150
necessarily the best option

413
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,610
so we may look at other service cuts but
I'm

414
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,510
its current iPhone so it should work
socially cross-platform except for one

415
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,030
that's

416
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,360
love after reading all the file that's
another thing we I'm a look at it

417
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,740
you know when that sets see if we can
get around st.

418
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,470
and but some people ask about that
afrikaans

419
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:55,470
he

420
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,440
yeah one when it sends a log will say
what actually happen

421
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,810
from which I P and there's also an alert
level

422
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:18,160
some and lots hasn't been implemented
yet

423
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,500
so may modifier tell a lot more

424
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,890
to get something out there's also image
is available on get up

425
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,960
up a both the client and server

426
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,450
if you wanna I know some people actually
ask for direct high-caliber

427
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,040
Etsy card and just images and then go so
that is available as well

428
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,780
so and any IP address

429
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,810
suspiciously on the network was added to
like the blacklists

430
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:49,300
and basically he couldn't access the
server or the quite know if it was on

431
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,970
that list

432
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,430
and it was universal so wat legacy as
you sent to the server sent to the other

433
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,270
client note as well so that way that one
night the edges would be isolated

434
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:05,270
you can you can communicate with your
network which is yet

435
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,390
is

436
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,910
yet any other questions

437
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,840
comments concerns who

438
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,300
right thank you all so much
