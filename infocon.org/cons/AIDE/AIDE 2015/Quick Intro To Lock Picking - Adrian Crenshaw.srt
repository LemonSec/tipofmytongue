and modify the slide at some or not I

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,790
think about it

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,200
dos man from women think polls that a
lot organization Bloomington Indiana

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,630
I he's come a mentor to come to lock
picking their

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,320
a deviant all of last me why it's

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,280
pronounced all of it is um he's out
doing lockpicking as well

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,840
well with a good book called up 0 the
practical lockpicking

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,509
that if you interests at the check it
out channel osmosis technical editor on

27
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,150
that book

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,720
he does not work on on well great like a
good deal I work on the coating a bluish

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,380
legs and weak evil system a couple years
back

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,829
and Doug a how will a and Jeff Moss da
to Cleveland Loch sport

31
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,950
and they had on little channels %uh be
that one

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,469
his dogs his show you how to make some
homemade lock picks West

33
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,740
what is lockpicking basically lock
picking and choosing

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,450
imperfections the lock and you
understand how it works you can actually

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,829
bypass about using the correct key

36
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,310
a technically we can make some mom
distinctions between

37
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,269
picking and bypass

38
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,849
picking usually involves today directly
manipulating the Pens a lock

39
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,170
or the wafers or this time blows

40
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,120
and bypasses the using some other
mechanism besides with the keyword

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,400
interact with directly

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,239
to be able to unlock it I'm gently
people may I ask I am

43
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,519
business kinda sketch epically to teach
people this

44
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,519
but the average criminal tribes bebop by
breaking in through a window or

45
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:37,360
something like that

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,260
I lot easier lockpicking from a contest
the standpoint well you can get and and

47
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,650
up

48
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,530
open a server room and take out the
server you'll need to attack

49
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,390
across the net will comply with the Data
laws also vary from state to state I'm

50
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,660
not quite sure what's going on West
Virginia have to look into that but most

51
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,260
states

52
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,430
of what's known as out they have to show
intent

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,950
for possession up pics to consider extra
charge a burglary tools

54
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,220
a couple it more than a second also
nothing it's a Pinterest

55
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,010
for people who pump what the box what
you wanna win at your front door lock is

56
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,660
any good

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,959
my purse the front door lockset some
people ask me this question it's just

58
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,970
the cheapy quickset because I have
windows

59
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,380
at windows right next to my door lock so
if someone really wants

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,920
smash grab we true got the latch China
and come on in

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,959
okay

62
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,319
lock bypass look different uses it
involve a

63
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,230
mclean the keys is also survived
subgroups in bypass I mean

64
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,989
shaming we are trying to push oxide the
latching mechanism

65
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,019
shipping we might be reaching inside the
lock to try to pull side locking dog to

66
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,069
try to explain a bit

67
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,870
a bypass drivers loading which is its
name from

68
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,280
a celluloid for basically going through
a door and

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,840
hitting the latch and putting it aside

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,450
I you use it deadlocking latch is that
close

71
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,329
and lock behind you way to this post a
hong

72
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,109
on modern ones as a little button
slightly depressed goes

73
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,630
in most people hanging might that
doesn't get pushed an

74
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,160
so you can Lloyd the lock or use a
credit card to get in for many of them

75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,250
on in with pop on the other side the jam

76
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,570
was like the Special very tough plastic
film driven by

77
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,790
to reach the end through and get past

78
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,550
but the molding an actual open the lock

79
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,740
I got past other some caught i think is
referred to as GM mama

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,950
by some people where they put a special
metal plate there to keep you from being

81
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,190
able to get do that

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,300
something this long I been able to get
around that before and

83
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,570
still get into the lock of the door
should say

84
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,260
at all so slim jims like autos and so
forth now

85
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,590
a question might be asked is is this
legal or not

86
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,880
apposition the lock picks can a base in
state to state up

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,580
on here pretty much if it's one the a
regular green

88
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,170
fix a legal statute state must prove
criminal intent to use it because im

89
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,070
that being is an extra charge if you're
caught with burglary tools

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,230
up but possession in about himself

91
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,750
is not necessarily illegal so basically
if you're caught breaking someplace

92
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,070
and you have locked pics as possible
extra charge tacked on

93
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,669
position itself not so bad %uh

94
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,810
just want that ok and the bluish green
which may not be really reading well on

95
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,500
the screen

96
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,770
does of pics

97
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,910
Aug legal duty black any statue
whatsoever

98
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,180
about tools One Direction researchers
information about this and like five

99
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,460
thousand dollars on lawyers the

100
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,330
the look at the Penn State lost figure
out what they work so some things may

101
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,510
have changed in Russia coming years ago
guess was

102
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,360
utmost the I be nada really like green
States

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,410
pixel legal but up ole law should be
noted

104
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,400
I guess various states where you can
have lock picks you can't transform

105
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,190
Selam

106
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,200
and I've been told recently in
california you can sell them

107
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,979
but you have to take name and address
also up information about them

108
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,290
other one state in the Union it's really
important about is Tessy

109
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,140
by the next actually did a few other
extensions but on you going to be a lot

110
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,040
to have them

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,500
but that's what we publicly as the on
licence locksmith these people the

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,820
protectionist thing for locksmiths in
Tennessee then

113
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,160
antibody fag and I i've been told
various things about Virginia

114
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,360
but does the state with the promise of a
what a

115
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,790
base yet to prove a good reason why you
have them about its shown

116
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,000
it's seen as intent that you plan to
commit a crime is that more less the

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,610
region works

118
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,819
okay now force worked a complete bitch

119
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,860
look surprised by this book when I past
times when I'm on a plane is the

120
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,509
lockpick

121
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:38,189
tote I've never had a problem my pics
get on nope well

122
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,389
no problems whatsoever the me look at
the case go OK and put it back in

123
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,900
that the main things ever gone
confiscate for me well technically

124
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,669
this to go back and check it but that
would cost too much waiting to believe

125
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:49,139
God

126
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,289
taking wake me up wire strippers and
soldering irons

127
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,419
starting out in half we see

128
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,749
the wire strippers which he referred to
as a ranch I'm not sure what I do that I

129
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:01,629
suppose I could like

130
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,789
threaten to click something goes up and
it

131
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,089
down I'll anyway I gotta play at all
times for bob this can take it

132
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:11,270
and sit there and pick locks and people

135
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,389
okay this keep going not your mileage
may vary in this

136
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,289
Chris Nixon actually a after the turn
the plane around but some people

137
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:29,210
freaked out when they ask saw him
picking locks on a plane and a

138

freaking out because they had pics I've
never had that problem

142
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,939
like Texas

143
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:50,610
well I salute you before going to try to
break a window not pick

144
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,330
10 gridlock is this give you a good idea
%uh

145
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,319
it looks cool on physical contest in
general we would break into place

146
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:58,969
basically

147
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:03,029
we getting through piggybacking we fall
someone else and after a smoke break

148

00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,379
so good also dislike lock I dislike the
mechanisms a

152
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,029
the chemical components a fun to play
with now tool has a couple warnings that

153
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:25,709
that's a big ol by the biggest
organization block sporting

158
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,930
well you don't have permission from the
wife owner I do not pick a lock you rely

159
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,300
on

160
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,140
jealous beginning you can pick a lock a
whole lot before it will be on

161
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,610
destroyed in on top only ones I've jelly
bust it all with a cheap Chinese ones

162
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,810
these mas a lot more threes I have all
over the place a

163
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,460
I would much back then the kits up
whether

164
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,440
bad locksmith staff or security actually
pretty robust as far as being the pick

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,760
'em

166
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,900
for a long period of time in not have a
bus tonya

167
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,390
will call a little bit about did
possible lock

168
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,110
we have the shack only for two for this
are padlock

169
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,330
the locking lever all Paul or dog this
base you're talking groupies

170
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,040
that fits into the shackle itself not
all locks

171
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,820
have this necessarily some have ball
bearings in those cases you can share

172
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,130
from

173
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,170
much hope you'll get a chance to show
you have the cylinder the lock

174
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,620
actuators a drivers to help move these
locking dogs aside

175
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,740
and that is the general body at the lock

176
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,600
I have a few cutaway locks around you
can actually see what's going on

177
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,280
up but the basics how most logical
encounter America

178
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,380
this is how they work a motion
accountable be pin tumbler locks

179
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,430
at 10 come a lock box on the the basis
up

180
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,460
you have Springs which up here drive up
and the one

181
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,850
some blue thankee pence some be with his
top bottom pens

182
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,610
think a lot can be Hong the opposite way
that we use to

183
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,890
United States its better column keep and
these red ones and drive up its

184
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,490
now when would you can pick a lock is
those imperfections

185
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,060
like this with exaggerated by the way
this all a call came from debt

186
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,890
Devin all if a in these

187
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,880
stacks menachem put create Lee drilled
right those imperfections in the

188
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,310
pins this allows you to do things like
below their tension on one

189
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,339
and lift the Pens up

190
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,260
try to get just the drive going to
publish airline

191
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,500
and you'll be able to turn it now
sources put a lock picks

192
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,290
want to use the cell of from 7
specialties but on

193
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,370
you can buy cheap Chinese thats that
mixed results in MI say a lot of them

194
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,560
use with the young crappy

195
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,370
welcome still good for some thangs but
unit Gillard best lock picks a lot of

196
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,570
stuff that said not so great

197
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,210
some Chinese manufacturers South Pacha
Khan as usual you find someone to all

198
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,770
selling um

199
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,000
almost two locations I sing sing the
song I'm a

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,030
want to come south Fort as I some some
specially

201
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,339
softening or directly they have some
decent pics I like them all right

202
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,970
and you can also a something special is
directly some stuff order from and

203
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,700
sparrows I liked a lot stuff gotten
spells lock picks

204
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,959
they set up a desk on every year pic
types

205
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,700
we have a hook using a pen lifting
halftime and this commuter raking

206
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,500
of single can picking if you want i
think is on very small water lock to be

207
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,160
a picket

208
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,130
no use of an essay on how you can do it
i lock you hate the flats at this

209
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,209
putting a lock holocaust Inc out the
number pens falling

210
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,760
the force offset halftime in

211
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,400
this is by my favorite picks for most of
them Loctite make a lot a lot

212
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,200
ok with this this is combat Coronel make
a possible for two as I think it may be

213
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,970
a city rec

214
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,610
said a ballsy referred to as a calm rake
which confuses things as Akamai get

215
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,130
something

216
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,030
highly different all tools like bogota
rupaul rave breaks

217
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,540
and those essentially on well

218
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,570
be a puppet of it has to be able to use
the tension tool to

219
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,730
but on this pattern this a free hot
pattern

220
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,740
getting into a whole lotta locks would
be probably talk

221
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,080
got me something more along the lines of
this where

222
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,820
you can use one at the tension tool

223
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,550
well use the won the pic sorry

224
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,079
you be apply a little attention

225
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,449
and breaking out with 01 and hopefully

226
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,320
get fan pic in short order if one
doesn't work

227
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,420
switched around try our way

228
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,519
and

229
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,850
well not be a dozen yet so much time you
can do a lot a LOX

230
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,440
with these bogota's these originate got
designed by God I'm a bun no

231
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,529
thing keeps on like blocking 101 forms
but this particular status from see a

232
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:55,990
pic

233
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,639
the me now somehow titanium alloy which
is really overkill

234
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,800
its the titanium thing is more fun the
gee-whiz factor it doesn't really help

235
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,360
you any

236
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,540
I have a buddy been given if you're not
hidden family they make

237
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,769
because the knives the movies and such
he's actually working on making some

238
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,579
bogota lock picks quiet with what we can
get a lot of Damascus steel

239
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,040
pattern welded so you have all that wood
grain its beautiful what the actual get

240
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,970
some produced

241
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,410
but on yeah that is some basic picked
accuracy

242
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,079
out some other ones I've cell I usually
have no

243
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,899
I have have a no handle on directly
that's fine you can use in that way

244
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,910
but and i'd get on that way cuz a
cheaper you might wanna come down

245
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,480
but to improve my music warrants heat
shrink tubing and put that on time and

246
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,899
put three layers in this heat that

247
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,850
treaty that up and shrink down to handle
that makes it good comfortable handle

248
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,550
you use one how to handle for a while
you have stock in store

249
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,750
that that's good I use hot glue to mod
my own handles

250
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,670
and summer the lockpick should get
special in China email or text them

251
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,740
thank paper with very fine grit

252
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,069
and a kinda smoothing of some cuz they
come

253
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:10,170
a little rough at times one was born
thanks

254
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,380
is the tension tool the test was used to
apply a little bit tension to lock

255
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,550
and which I do is get each one love

256
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,250
the the drive a pencil luck about that
she relied on like a little edge

257
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,579
created a climate little bit attention
but I mean you won't create

258
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,720
you won't put very little tension I
should carry

259
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,870
more up teaching tools I do anything
else about the show you

260
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,230
a/c my actions that I me actually a more
pics

261
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,310

different purposes

262
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,810
cuz so I just need want to lock into
lock just the right spot

263
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,010
to be able to get it open

264
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,870

transparent locks here

266
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,590
act right explains little bit

267
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,190
earlier and I have the most Asians a
second actually you know what's good

268
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,100
I have alterations in the next one 0
four sources for

269
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,830
kitchen tools give old wiper blades when
selectors

270
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,360
take apart you can find a good medal in
that for making pensioners

271
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,860
I buddy my mixes sometimes out a bomb
pop up campers

272
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,080
if the same the spring it's flat and up

273
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,670
tricks who wrestles you go looking
around on the ground various places

274
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,500
that's what the mitchell bogota's were
made out of my standing 02 about picking

275
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,550
this all looks americana Lee you try to
pick a lock

276
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,860
the key on tensions to be very gentle at
least at first he had picked

277
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,570
the matter you relaxed attention ought
to be able to turn that dipping out of

278
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,290
spring it

279
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,570
but on my body Mic we was first being
taught how to lock pick

280
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,930
his teacher told him this little arm
analogy which I really like my house txt

281
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,840
me put on a

282
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,570
on attention to in europe et and you
dearly loved it

283
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,370
this and has poison all around it you
want mister anti to walking the boys

284
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,310
because the guy

285
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,740
but you want to put too much pressure
top ant's head that's a question

286
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,440
so ethnic can't up

287
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,630
way people practice lot people um
practice on lock house like someone to

288
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,540
have the back here

289
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,150
a couple mass not much reason to the fis
were padlocked a nice the practice on

290
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,160
so you get these progressive sets like
you see right here I

291
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,360
much just the film this was the United
it's good for Pakistan

292
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,720
picking door locks but holding hands
that were realistic feel I have some

293
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,240
moms

294
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,390
locks backed it up smiley faces on them
thereof different complex these two

295
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,120
padlocks

296
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,080
week even have diff numbers appearance
saudis progresses relic 1p and 2p and 3p

297
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,650
in

298
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,120
you can practice harder harder locks
losses transparent locks

299
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,260
these trips are not good for practice
not like we have the same

300
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,500
feedback that a real lock does but the
night with a mystery how

301
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,050
works ok checks also fuck gun out locks
if you want some the pack is on

302
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,160
good habitat for humanity also old
locksmiths

303
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,380
I saw locksmith sometimes I want to
throw out and sometimes hard with those

304
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,990
Excel all partied out locks

305
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,700
dispatches from Habitat for Humanity

306
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,000
impulses says the senate to me but your
final ox they have like three bucks

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,280
entire door lock except the key the keys
missing but

308
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,490
all purposes not having the key is not a
huge problem

309
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,860
also the lock types I both have been
talking a pin tumbler lock so far

310
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,620
but this also awarded locks were
essentially this peace in the Middle

311
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,069
keep you turning like a screwdriver in
it no pin lock we have some has the

312
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,839
right cuts in it

313
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,320
you can turn it no problem up in time
the locks which is most what you are

314
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,920
seeing whatsoever comment so far

315
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,160
way for locks with you look down the
keyway you see little flat piece is a

316
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,690
metal

317
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,830
you find is unlocked cabinets
technically it caught might be a way for

318
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,540
Locke also got the better version of it

319
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,770
that is very cheap to manufacture and
other debt a lock switch with a

320
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,780
combination locks

321
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,900
but they're having to turn the dial left
and right left and right the key itself

322
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
as angles cutting it

323
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,820
that miss you do the same thing this be
a representation of awarded lock

324
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,280
and sexy you set pieces amid on the way

325
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,110
keep you from turning the key attorney
in your piece metal

326
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,100
on me give an example love awarded lock
you can tell it on the Warlock you look

327
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
on the keyway

328
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,600
even see it doesn't have kids well

329
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,750
the setup 5

330
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,880
what pics

331
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,050
to open up most-wanted locks a/c is that
if you got which ones which

332
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,429
but this is the cheapest locking fun at
Walmart you must take

333
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,190
the keating for this particular variety
cut down every thank the very tip

334
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,730
and then used it as a key but this is

335
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,980
potentially these um what pics

336
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,790
look like a skeleton key for water locks
these things are very

337
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,340
crappy not this one the mountains
getting one from Walmart I

338
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,190
master locks all a little better but not
a lot

339
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,530
on the reason people still use warlock
some places though

340
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,120
is big cocked up the get like good and
I'm and you can still operate 'em

341
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,560
they've messed up some you can still
operate up to the very robust

342
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,000
standpoint %uh reliability but they're
not really

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,640
critically secure locks you but

344
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,660
you see what's next you you have a
warlock

345
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,870
have should have some more aborted pics
bacteria and somewhat lost the election

346
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,780
was a try does

347
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,640
I this the said the water pics which I

348
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,330
or showed way for locks with the locks
work on these look

349
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,420
up stepped out wafers that when the
right key is put in

350
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,680
it moves the wafers outta the way the
cylinder

351
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,080
and you can't understand it you find
these on all sorts of them

352
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,120
was cabinets in such I need

353
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
the very cheap to manufacture actually
was at a a a bank what's

354
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,560
and had a lockbox all the keys the high
security locks

355
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,420
but the key for the lockbox whether
peace crap like this

356
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,640
you can tell it's a way for lock which

357
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,940
well it's hard to see in this lighting
but sexy pants

358
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,510
you see Desplat pieces %uh medal in
there

359
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,560
which ID but life you actually be to see
well

360
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,570
but I'm texting a pot you and show you

361
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,750
what I mean by wafers going pull out the
way now this is the in a cylinder

362
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,140
plug you see that is no way for us

363
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,720
nominees wafers woodlock in to does
grooves

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,150
you see and you want me to turn the lock

365
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,790
however seven-fold in the right way this

366
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,880
work if you put and

367
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,430
the proper key Fort all the way for
should live up

368
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:45,430
and move out the way so

369
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,830
that it would now be a ton cylinder

370
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,510
no problem not the basics how way for
lock works

371
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,270
use to gauge a pic but just raking open
fine a little bit tension

372
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,110
pulling a break into across them and it
usually doesn't take much did but

373
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,510
these are usually a pretty crappy but
they also

374
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,510
uses see a lot of TSA locks with a cup
in a bit

375
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,050
hopefully but that also use a way for us

376
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,350
a

377
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,080
this is pin to unlock some let's go back
to him

378
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,440
a way flock again and this if i'd

379
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,590
oh yes I like this lockers has
interesting not

380
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,280
but even though it's a kinda crappy
lock-in indeed has been doing things

381
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,850
about it

382
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,710
that I find 'em well us a cute

383
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,500
I you see in trying to find the right

384
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,240
tool for this job I will use you

385
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,200
you and yet this particular one

386
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,000
I can sometimes get into without even
using attention tool

387
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,630
most like in the movies you see people
only use want role in the lock

388
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,830
that's not going to lock picking only
works no stranger to this one you can

389
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,940
sometimes get away with that

390
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,090
this lock here the TSA lock is meant for
when you travel

391
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,430
TSA exotic cut your up tag you got to
cut you lots of

392
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,170
they can use a special so the key is
this case a TSA key number seven

393
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,490
and be able to get in and hope you lock

394
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,660
either way this was not as extra feature
that when the TSA agent

395
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,640
opens up the property the pot is red
flags you know someone's been in it

396
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,760
and then the actual can use that
knowledge is the combination on it

397
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,990
and later on just like we said

398
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,269
and take

399
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:33,849
back to normal that reflects both the
pop-up we have someone picks

400
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:38,109
onsite doesn't pick when is the pup
keyboard however

401
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:42,599
0

402
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,149
well nice that some that opened even if
just attention to all

403
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:50,950
used to get

404
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,500
spat tolerances and it'll have a way for
Locke also this one is

405
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,800
now I'll tell you so we flocks its bad
colleges you can pick it

406
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,140
too greasy knows that the red flag does
not pop up

407
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,070
I thought those in need anyway

408
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,970
that's an example way to lock usually
that I'll just go all good way for locks

409
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,390
but

410
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,450
back how a pin tumbler lock works though

411
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,770
you see out keeping look and Cumnock way
it works is

412
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,820
cunt the key matchup keepin' live in the
right height

413
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,100
but the gap between Japan and keep an
eye on the share line

414
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,410
then you can turn in a plug for

415
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,350
at first base to paint on the lock

416
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,110
only pick one with abuse imperfections
try to get those

417
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,470
dry pants the lock up above the sheer
lie one

418
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,340
also down a bit back here is someone
going through

419
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,260
feeling for where a particular penned by
attorney at your nose

420
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,000
one hand is hard push the other that's
on your push a little further

421
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,020
and he fell at least he might fill a
cylinder turn a little bit

422
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,240
any go on to the next one and so on so
forth a setup process a single can

423
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,770
picking

424
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,940
illustrations at the bottom one again
always

425
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,930
of work we might come from David
position people can do

426
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,520
also make a lot harder to pick like
going in school fans must repair & on

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,820
weighty things work is expected in the
pan

428
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,020
and we try to talk about the shoreline
it hangs

429
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,640
so you have to pic got hey

430
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,780
it's a false set yet to release a little
tension pushed up again

431
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,100
refuse puts bill clinton won it becomes
well

432
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,549
condom honestly difficult open

433
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:35,390
I'll so with that actual show a little
bit picking

434
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,450
and also pass around a key for a lock in
a

435
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,370
key you can see how one works this one
actually has

436
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,320
as hard make read on on camera

437
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,399
the largest school pants this one will
pass around cuz I'm psychotropic

438
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:54,580
funny all cuz it's gonna take way too
long for me but

439
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,700
noticed that when you are a key in it

440
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,730
the drought pens are going below to
share a lot you can't turn it

441
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:08,730
if you put in the wrong key some the key
pens

442
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,299
gonna be in the way a stock at ten

443
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:17,799
reprint just the right one all the pins
lineup

444
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,000
the gap between the drive and keeping
our she align

445
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,220
and you can turn it now I would do is
pass this around to beat but actually

446
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,679
see

447
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,380
what that looks like it up with the
wrong keys and the right keys

448
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,440
and you give you an idea of how to lock
works

449
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,639
lamee'a be so great here but I will try
to pick

450
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:40,880
this one on personally I don't like
these a practice because

451
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,499
kinda bummed

452
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:47,079
well the feedback on is not the same as
a full-fledged real lock

453
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,159
also he also said but

454
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,159
expected sparkled like I'm picking a
upside down but that's the way I have to

455
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,159
see it be able to do it

456
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,179
so

457
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,499
like a looker tension trying to feel for
which one by ends

458
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:06,099
get the block but she alive what order
to abide in

459
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:09,659
base unlock the lock even adults that
locks the same model number may not

460
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:10,469
necessarily

461
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:15,899
had the same binding order me and

462
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:19,909
right there I you look at that look at
least I tried to lock a few but the

463
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:20,589
sheer lie

464
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:24,699
looks like I got most of them I don't
have perfectly

465
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:29,249
somebody is not turning so I gotta

466
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:34,289
probe which one is binding you and Ed

467
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:39,419
that it just a little bit more and

468
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,579
area

469
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:46,690
and i cant turn the lock

470
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,919
that the bases the pic

471
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,239
basically feeling it which one by and
then what that was all the way

472
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,309
going through in the rest you photo of
you spoke and one

473
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:02,460
that makes it so much more difficult
it's got to go office get a route

474
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,789
I should have extra keys what I guess
hangs on around will help since

475
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,159
but thing the key it doesn't help as
much but it is a good bill it

476
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,279
visual illustration you play that lock
'em passing around

477
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:17,759
up use and almost time I don't actually
single can pick anything

478
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,859
I will get single can picking I make a
lot of raking essentially isn't setup

479
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:22,359
right

480
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:25,679
each got each individual can you take

481
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,759
well he started the mass locker loop too
because that since the raking

482
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,399
some people make us some distinction
that its jiggling are rocking

483
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,460
but traffic that splitting hairs
essentially

484
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,570
unit-linked but spend same time trying
random combinations essentially to try

485
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,419
to get lock open

486
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,840
a question of you ask is which way do I
turn the lock dozen general rules on

487
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,239
this

488
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,529
if the poll if it's a dead ball and box
on the left

489
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:54,399
you turn it clockwise the retract the
boat it on your right

490
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,919
counterclockwise now for blue-collar
mass the locks

491
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,239
like up this one right here this is a

492
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:05,320
olmaz like 3 these you can gently
picking even direction

493
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,989
so doesn't matter which way to China I
am

494
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:13,039
mailbox locks gently counterclockwise

495
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,100
doorknobs any which way does the in
Vegas so the dog trying to pick

496
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,230
and notice could do it then when I
finally picked it

497
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,409
we couldn't make the the boat turn cuz
he was picking at

498
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:27,090
well both on left clockwise to picket we
picked it

499
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,999
we could operate it goes a long way to
go that one was actually

500
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,019
counterclockwise a sometimes don't have
a completely different is actually a

501
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,539
tool called a plug spanner

502
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,950
that some lot to just easy to pick back
with the all the way this post the pic

503
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,970
tack shop with the mechanisms so you can
pick it backwards maybe the plug spanner

504
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,190
sticking a lot hit a button at has
spring-loaded took cunt the

505
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,519
asunder so fast the pencil get chance
fold-out

506
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,639
and you can't get in is actually bunch
of mass like M-one

507
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,970
the like that in fives

508
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,260
why I'm not quite sure when in doubt
though I

509
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,900
turn clockwise poly best I have exact
the discs for that but

510
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,900
that seems to work best me most time now
on

511
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,270
also away the picking member I mention

512
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,060
most time lockpicking we want left just
drive up and about she allowed

513
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,460
in this case that blue pen but some
locks have so much room

514
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,030
up what's called the Bible the lock all
the pains we tracked into

515
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,590
that you can actually push up everything
up into the

516
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,640
the Bible lock and still be a ton

517
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,100
that the tab over lifting attack you do
that with complex

518
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,410
now here is an example of a Compaq I got
in

519
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,440
and if they're looks like a little calm
got my lock here

520
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,950
certainly looks but if you all you know
what action so it looks

521
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,970
the same for both of us let's do this
slightly better

522
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,120
of lichen stay on camel I'm doing it
good

523
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,120
okay so see up in the Bible lock the
whole lotta room

524
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,590
springs are very strong and i got if I
get out

525
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,820
got the right come pick the put in it
actually be able if them

526
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,190
so what is the right gauge for that so
let me lock it

527
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,290
in if I have to keep that model

528
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,690
of I hope that model block before or if
I feel a route and say

529
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,790
okay to feels right yes no absolute way
and sometimes you can get a Compaq stuck

530
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,280
in a lot used the wrong one

531
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,320
so

532
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,390
I gotta accomplishing their I think at
chose the right gauge

533
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:41,050
but maybe not good and got double check
that gauge

534
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,620
looks close but

535
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,840
it that in there Press

536
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,220
up islet all depends but she align hope
that got

537
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,590
camera right and that lined up right

538
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,409
hopefully you'll be able to turned

539
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,480
cylinder operate the lock

540
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,250
well

541
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,250
all listed this is the a.m

542
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,630
com pic a conflict that 7 specially
cells

543
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,240
but I'm having problems

544
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
getting it to work decisively see the
idea is to get everything listed above

545
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,690
the scheelite

546
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:38,690
well actually just got to stop turn
actually receiving hope to hold up

547
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,490
properly see if I can to light up

548
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,990
area it's hot

549
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,520
holding we all can see it and do it same
time but since all I was doing was

550
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,230
lifting all depends but she lied

551
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,730
sir so I could turn it and that call

552
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,050
picking now that's Chinese offer you
some

553
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,630
but demo ing however you have to cut out
when the United States very much

554
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,180
on however to also types a bomb

555
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,960
mast lucky when can a lot dust solid
bodied

556
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,770
and have soared from the Bible you can't
just do the exact same attack

557
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:23,310
like up

558
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,690
how many people block looks like this
for

559
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,030
and it must you know what exactly think
shape it's made up

560
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:36,820
all brass parties is that same issuer

561
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,130
the summit room on the Bible lock you
kept going over lifting attack

562
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,380
open real fast was a contest um

563
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,490
good con I lost cuz I wanted a pic when
these

564
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,560
back a bit like no one else could else
pick this one

565
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,690
and so what I don't get it going to have
around bad conflict with Mecca got that

566
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,600
sometimes those little bit difficult

567
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,310
obvious to me but with complex no
problem though types are taxed people

568
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,020
can do

569
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,440
they can do impression attacks where
they put a very soft grass key

570
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,720
we get back and forth in the lock look
for where blue intentions ok a.m.

571
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,380
friction boxer made on the key pilot
galloping file

572
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,440
and in this keep repeating today have
exact duplicate original key

573
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,160
well close enough to cook it I was also
a master keying

574
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,610
where people put x2 way for such you
have one key to my open all the locks in

575
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,100
building

576
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,280
but if a key to only open like just say
just office door

577
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,500
and they sometimes do that doesn't waste
but yep intellectual wafers

578
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,160
and lock 2 I'm

579
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,500
captain key depp's which the two finger
actually turn

580
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,350
sometimes action makes easy typical rate
because you have difficulty nations that

581
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,960
walk possible combinations are actually
open up to go lock

582
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,560
up look at the current time I'll Oxo Tot

583
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,650
or rented like we only see what vertical
stack

584
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,510
for instance though often trip to locks

585
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,730
like this the tubular lock

586
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,730
and has pens warranted and

587
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,440
a circle but the principle is still the
same I'm you'll have the Kia pS I can't

588
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,630
show you is at right now

589
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,100
Oregon I shall should look up

590
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:26,610
and back locked up

591
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,780
up since the work exact same you

592
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,330
but is just tens pointed

593
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,570
in a different way next victim lock
picks that you can use

594
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,610
the justice of impression kinda thing
what

595
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,750
you push a man you wiggle um and its
slow start getting his lone eagles

596
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,810
where you've been to get the actual Kiwi
produced then you can match the Dept

597
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,980
and get the Kiwi produced by number %uh
a note have a pen come to lock you

598
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,020
encounter sometimes

599
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,130
up is a a double lock

600
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,310
a dimple lock if the side the key

601
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,610
that actually have indentations for

602
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:11,830
but still a pin tumbler lock got to be a
lockpick for instance I have one around

603
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,390
here

604
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,780
mix look sometimes getting to work but
on have one like it be my actions a

605
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,480
plate later

606
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,260
the those a while back I think it was
minutes in late 90's

607
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,440
does the bike lock up in a Kryptonite
and

608
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,720
they produced a buncha by clocks that
could be picked for using a pic 10

609
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,210
basically take the pic can showed in the
lock wiggle it

610
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,710
do a self pressuring onto the the onto
the big pan

611
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,890
YouTube it should be noted lock my
standing is

612
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,460
the regional television the goodnight
lock did not have this problem

613
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,750
and now later once not the problem is
going to be a brief time period

614
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,830
and the reason for that is some or the
cheapest but they couldn't China and

615
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:56,140
I got a mess Skyler towns actually
trying to figure out

616
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,000
in a various records the guy who person
actually made to order

617
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,570
that purchase decision up this is

618
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,780
example the temple lockout going to
before knows how that pans on the sides

619
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,620
the keys are its downsides that where
you actually have a little

620
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,120
its you can still pick those general
idea I don't have a

621
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,120
double specific pics is up a low tension
on it

622
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,810
pick the flats I don't pick and this
kinda fun we getting there

623
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,090
and so not too high the pic because you
usually have less

624
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,580
possible key depp's is not the
Christopher pinning

625
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,690
catch this has much room to move around
on but also picks made especially for

626
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,330
double locks than those with boys like

627
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,700
um this detail locks this 1i have a pic
4

628
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,840
I'm not liable II looking to work the
weight these work

629
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,900
is you have whatever combination lock
you have a bunch of them

630
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,140
distant I'm and aqui les a line to the
right angle

631
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,250
when that happens school sidebar will
fall out the way

632
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:05,250
and allowed us to monitor at I

633
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,030
upload one of those & Co pragmatic for

634
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:13,360
well actually have a chain up-tempo
locks i care about. just illustrating

635
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,810
how

636
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,210
'em some different types a block work

637
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,370
see good chain over

638
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,490
yes I do go through airport security
sometimes

639
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,840
to change the locks in no no one says
anything a/c

640
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,560
should be okay just

641
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,280
come up yeah this is the cheap Chinese
detain a lock

642
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,400
up

643
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,100
still have time to actually take it

644
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,420
and I would be that live love anyway but
Keyport

645
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,770
looks something like this

646
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,380
though angles cutting it and the lines
those

647
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,820
this inside the lock five of all the way

648
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,200
attendees ball bearings if all the way

649
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,280
and the ball bearings makes love it
locks caption which are shown a bit

650
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,140
so this is in the public eager not like
this alright I

651
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,390
so much I when the other keys on here

652
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,930
also see

653
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,440
was that should happen on its

654
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,000
without saying

655
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,040
for okay at one time I had a puppy frist

656
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,710
on this chain up for the show and I
can't fathom why would take

657
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,930
of here yes so

658
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:50,930
it's got all the right angles cut in it
so when it lines up

659
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,070
type of all the way you can see on that
and the ball bearings can move out the

660
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,369
way

661
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:01,609
another with these you become doesn't
speak to keep going smoothly

662
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,090
afterwards right now since I use the
property a key goes in fairly smoothly

663
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,410
I just picked it all the gates be
misaligned

664
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,570
and would get it feels it ok so much
prolly been inside this lock

665
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,300
some time ago

666
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,590
but I'm II

667
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,530
that place with other types ovum ways of
getting to a lot besides picking and

668
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,080
making a

669
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,420
does but keys a bulky basically works
I've heard people say it works on the

670
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,270
principle up

671
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,390
like newton's cradle we pull back
appalling doubts about

672
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,080
about about that is you hit keep an

673
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,240
it rose everything up the Bible

674
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,200
that key pants fall down first the
driver can still up there for a moment

675
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,890
and you can ton it I've also heard it
before it is a screen chaos in the lock

676
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,330
this is the way I Skyler which was to it
up I'm not show it was popping

677
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,420
physics that point is and I want to go
do some cameras like

678
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,920
can't hold the fact well not his camera
I can take the whole thing but at the

679
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,540
same time

680
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,290
but the idea is you have a key that has
been

681
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,380
take down to low steps and we put that n
and pump it

682
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,570
today's you hit each pan

683
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,900
and I forgot one spot hit each pen

684
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,180
and at the same time past everything up
in the Bible a lock

685
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,010
fave happens right for a brief moment
the lock cylinder

686
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,940
returned now I use this particular one
trip back saying

687
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,740
cousin 01 20 hounding on it for hours
before it actually works

688
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,880
but this particular mass like I know
it's good for these demos

689
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,329
1

690
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:40,069
which is watched by put that on my demo
check I

691
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:45,460
I know for future reference but at

692
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,680
simple lock pump there's also more

693
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,819
automated ways of doing such same thang
saying like those pic guns

694
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,960
and that's what this is especially with
the same principle as

695
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,400
lock bumping except for you

696
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,720
using electronic means Ala Moana

697
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,619
the sinking of a double the grill for
change head on it and your sis is

698
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:11,359
bouncing up and

699
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,640
up and down causing chaos eventually
hopefully

700
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,520
thanks matchup in such a way that you
can tight

701
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,329
let me see if I get my tension tool in
there

702
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:26,470
may not work well see

703
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,880
baseball's pens around this the army to

704
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,579
she align and you can't %uh nifty stuff

705
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:40,720
and if it is locked in use way too much
is getting really beaten up

706
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,990
0 but like a fifty dollar toy from

707
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:51,109
China them

708
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,470
is also showing a lock not Capital One

709
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,480
ball bearings I can do it on a lot of
locks

710
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,010
and we should make a lock works is I
mention locking dogs before

711
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,630
I'll you if you look at this lock you
know these little

712
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,319
but locking dogs fail blame have a good

713
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,369
that into this

714
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:17,400
group shackle the idea behind shaming is

715
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,339
were pushing something and and moving
those out the way

716
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,720
so we can open the lock for get up out

717
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,510
showed up visually

718
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,290
see I was creepin up if

719
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,170
this demo Scott disposal items
eventually

720
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:43,170
it do break I'm a couple good ones the

721
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:47,650
yells is officially make shams

722
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,180
also made some myself autobahn that wat
up

723
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,980
%uh new me a that so now me

724
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,829
plastic before people %ah times make a
modified 10 cans and such

725
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,089
but I am but now it professionally made
once

726
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:07,359
just cut the nicest 30 ok not without
cutting myself as much when trying to

727
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,030
make one myself over 10 can't

728
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,430
but the way these work is you have

729
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,940
you lock try to push does locking dogs

730
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,309
aside so is a butterfly shams

731
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:24,849
you put him on he sighed lock a try to
turn a man

732
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:28,200
push the locking dog

733
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,279
aside right now

734
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:36,279
common thing it being in there okay them
see what the other one

735
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:39,789
i ami'm

736
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:42,789
tried to get this one here

737
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,140
turn it

738
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:53,140
get that it that

739
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,180
by the way up I'm not due to standing up
cuz

740
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,940
talking a bit over and do it and

741
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,630
I think I just picked this one the point
where it may no longer function

742
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:14,190
well michigan the pop

743
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,970
women faster if this one had been since
the shredded by now

744
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,050
Summerfield this one away the cab
disposable items eventually gonna break

745
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,560
up

746
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,540
up I have one day made out of plastic
that

747
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,690
of also gone to work before just a
really really tough plastic

748
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,690
Missy

749
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:40,130
but is also avoiding

750
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:43,740
I show a little bit that before I have
specially made card like this I you some

751
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,330
time to putting a lattice I'd

752
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,610
the reason for this is on a better
picture this lot people behind the door

753
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,070
right

754
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,840
is low but it was the comment on a latch
keep from the pressing

755
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,420
if it's been close until the keys x
using outside

756
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,960
lot people on hand or right and you can
large away in

757
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,270
and very short time another but rick is

758
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,530
ships the some top Commission ashes
bypassed tools on

759
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,800
to get into 'em is

760
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,040
okay I thought which on the screen

761
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,340
specials a better okay

762
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,450
the way these work is on do it
interlocking you manipulate walking dogs

763
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,710
outside you got my message to the Pens
directly

764
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:28,190
you up messing with blocking dogs

765
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,230
so region for added you see that locking
I'll let their

766
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,790
sampling aside the one on top that's the
way some people bypassed work

767
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:41,190
and on these want specifically with
design

768
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,880
the master locks where you dumb bitch

769
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,090
and you buddies with master switch from
%uh sparrows

770
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:52,600
Peterson up manufacturing also makes
perfect 1

771
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,620
because there's a silver bullet what up
different falls to hold

772
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,740
top for that I want all the whole bottom

773
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,080
willette puff the lock %uh

774
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,750
I found ok brinks locks generate more
secure but

775
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,900
the pika pika part 1 that

776
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,580
you can use lot the same thing the same
tool this region

777
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,010
and got to get a bright spot

778
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,400
touch forget the pop real easy I

779
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,080
also the ones I have applause where you
can open this way

780
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,280
that's also again for ones that use um a
locking dog not

781
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,030
ball bearings a series of like bypass
drivers

782
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,420
like this is American padlock those US
Military Issue

783
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,590
fix them the nineties it's actually a
really

784
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,510
potluck pip but the flawed heart lines
up

785
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,980
if you look at the back a bit the cam
that is

786
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,620
aligned like this with the keyway and
you can meet a trolling the internet

787
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,890
now some me a padlock licks on my eye
mask the ones that are we cable tie

788
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,930
I have backed the on the chain um the
other oil and that's what you can

789
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,500
actually turn 20 stools

790
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,780
but we'll show you how this tool works
essentially its golf club shaped

791
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,390
and you put it into the lock upside down

792
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:13,270
sick and I said again this is the heart
one pic it's got like serrated pandering

793
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,300
in school pants its pics get the pic

794
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,380
but with a to like this because it
doesn't shield

795
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,330
the back a lot you can reach to back a
lock turn it

796
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,780
and pop shackle now they start um

797
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,160
fishing Lord if the pair here to keep
you from being to be taller the back

798
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,860
then I think piercing least way for
breaker would you put a lock

799
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,690
pounded break that wafer-thin still use
the tool I think most modern ones may be

800
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,930
that big about

801
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,620
integrated completely in the field is
you can't use it to like this

802
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,150
that easy way to get into that type of
American lock we haven't bypass tools

803
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,130
and MC comes time ago

804
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,320
old is also under the door tools I have
one back there

805
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,350
this is what you do is you reach on the
door

806
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:02,050
any ADA compliant or they have lower
level has use on the door

807
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,640
you grab the other side a bit with the
under the door tool is often called

808
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,280
mules

809
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,570
you grab hold a handle put down and

810
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,120
divided in you can buy online but

811
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,010
you also may come I have improvised one
back there and

812
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,310
handcuffs I don't have time for
handcuffs bomb

813
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,520
topic and cups generally unless you do
it improvised items that you carrying

814
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:26,970
around

815
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,970
out lock picks you by KR handcuff key to

816
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,570
I but his way to get around these which
I don't have a lot on the cover

817
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,730
basically involves shipping it to get
this I'll

818
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:42,570
boxing's out the way and I have

819
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:45,850
left at one about had we can take a look
at later on and then a break during
