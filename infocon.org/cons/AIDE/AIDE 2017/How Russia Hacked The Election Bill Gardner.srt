00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,510
when I'm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no so whoever it was</font>

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,530
hanging everywhere you need to sound man

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,719
apparently so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm bill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gardner and lets</font>

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know me from digital forensics and</font>

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:24,509
information assurance degree program

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:26,400
here at Marshall University so today I'm

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,330
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit down got bad knees</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,300
can't see me on the video so we're going

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about rushing hacking so what is</font>

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,959
this story about Russia hacking the

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,980
election so everyone's heard this right

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,600
so what actually happened well let's

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what actually happened and</font>

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,090
talk about the narrative that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned about and sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of debunk</font>

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:58,079
some of the other narratives that are

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:03,149
out there so basically how Russia hacked

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,700
our elections not really about hacking

19
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,280
it is to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent but it's more about</font>

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">information warfare in cyber warfare</font>

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,490
nation-state against nation state and so

22
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,339
basically how this was done according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence community there's a</font>

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:29,189
joint report released by FBI NSA dia and

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:30,960

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,600
Russians are<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known for cyber</font>

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,009
alleged and people have said they found

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,299
true proof that the Russians took down

36
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,759
Ukrainian power grid Matt Perry was

37
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,270
talked about this earlier about how he

38
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,239
went through his users and disabled

39
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,730
their macros because the attack vector

40
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,630
here was

41
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:23,850
macro so they basically send out we sent

42
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:26,010
out microsoft office files and told

43
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,840
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> macros so that they</font>

44
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,030
could it was supposed to be part parts

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,650
of utility operation but anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

46
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,750
how they got pwned and that's allegedly

47
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,500
the foothold they<font color="#E5E5E5"> use in order to take</font>

down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ukrainian power grid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia has</font>

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:55,520
a long history of cyber warfare there's

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:03:00,840
the 2007 disagreement with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Estonia</font>

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:03,500
where a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian war the Russian hero war</font>

statue was in every Soviet bloc country

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,600
it was a tribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to date to Great Mother</font>

54
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,760
Russia and how they'd send their troops

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,680
to liberate them with communism the

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,050
some hard feelings so in this attack

61
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,130
Russia basically knocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> Estonia offline</font>

for number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sunny is a specially</font>

65
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,910
that's them as disconcerning thing you

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,500
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> waking up tomorrow you know wake</font>

67
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,120
up tomorrow the power being out would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,310
pretty bad but if you woke up<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow</font>

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,840
and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> device's would give you</font>

70
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,209
any news about what was going on the

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,050
world and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get money out</font>

72
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:03,360
of the bank and you can't that is kind

73
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,130
of discerning disconcerning and you're

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,570
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> country like a</font>

75
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,190
stunning it because it's relatively

76
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:17,099
small also in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Georgian conflict the</font>

77
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:19,890
2008 Russian cyber campaign actually

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">took down georgia targets including</font>

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,240
website this is water not vodka by the

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,220
way in denial serve

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:36,289
attacks so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

83
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,289
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do here is disrupt information</font>

84
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,650
so in the case study want to use to look

85
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,909
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian hacking allegation is</font>

86
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:53,609
the Democratic<font color="#CCCCCC"> National Committee so</font>

87
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:59,120
John Podesta is email was accessed by an

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,120
attacker or attackers using fishing and

89
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,650
and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they did was they</font>

90
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,630
attack the weakest link you know

91
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,049
attackers don't break in through

92
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,240
firewalls anymore they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

93
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bypass your next-generation firewall</font>

94
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,810
and the billions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

95
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,179
spent pending blinking like boss boxes

96
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your network parameter they're</font>

97
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to attack user because users a</font>

98
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:30,180
weakest link because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

99
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:35,960
make mistakes people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will always fall</font>

100
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:39,210
for your tricks for social engineering

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,159
so how this happens the attacker goes

102
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,888
through the following phases there is a

103
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:45,800
phase of information gathering attack

104
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:50,430
planning and then finally attack

105
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,550
execution so background an attacker will

106
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,620
look at an organization and use open

107
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,979
source intelligence so this is publicly

108
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:03,330
available information to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a number</font>

109
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,310
of employees locations job openings the

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,240
names of the executives so they could be

111
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:14,250
targeted email formats and also current

112
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,110
events we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good example of a</font>

113
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,240
current event that would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

114
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,449
people click on the links what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,680

actual footage of tomahawk missiles

117
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,930
hitting Syria would you be interested

118
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,849
enough to click on that if there's not

119
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,110
already efficient campaign using that

120
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:39,000
there will be soon because what what

121
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">fisher's what to do or attackers want to</font>

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,160
do is to

123
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:47,890
to compel you they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of</font>

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,930
reach for the your gut<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say you know</font>

125
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,330
hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at this there is a</font>

126
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,250
need for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this which will</font>

127
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,810
overpower your other sense of I

128
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,480
shouldn't be clicking on links I don't

129
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,390
know where they go and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

130
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,550
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicking on the link wins out</font>

131
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:13,990
I mean I've been fished because I was

132
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:18,010
compelled by the link so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep we had</font>

133
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:20,440
a talk on Tuesday by one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my students</font>

134
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:24,610
who's doing fishing campaign for

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Marshall health and and one of the</font>

the fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal fishing</font>

138
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,040

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they complained that you know</font>

140
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,290
fishing campaigns would not be that

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,480
sophisticated and if you look a

142
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,490
nation-state back fishing campaign it's

143

going to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated because</font>

168
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,090
because they're compelled they're bored

they want to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

170
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,690
and it's very easy it's sort of like the

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:05,890
copy and paste stuff that goes around

174
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,650
somebody would see something funny and

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they send it to all their friends</font>

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you know do a search for your state</font>

just for west virginia alone so there

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,569
what happened March the 19th of last

206
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,680
year there was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email sent to mr.</font>

207
00:10:51,570 --> 00:11:00,269
Podesta said someone has his password so

208
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,579
I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good right it has</font>

209
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,120
the google logo on it it's got red it's

210

213
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:20,069

214
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,610
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to walk up to the board</font>

215
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and take a look at it so anyway what we</font>

216
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,360
have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a festive sophisticated</font>

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,779
attack they're hitting all the right

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,019
notes there's no misspellings it looks

219
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:37,439
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it led to a bitly link which</font>

220
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:40,079
led to a server in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russia which has been</font>

221
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:45,060
dubbed by the antivirus<font color="#E5E5E5"> people as fancy</font>

222
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:47,399
their apt 28 were so fancy there needs

223
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,680
to be a rosetta stone of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">names that anti viruses give them out</font>

225
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,270
wear because it becomes a marketing

226
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:02,430
campaign okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> also I'm trademarking the</font>

227
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:07,670
term apt 69 so I have prior art this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

228
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually proof of prior art</font>

229
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:17,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">its chair squeaking i thought from</font>

230
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,680
minute I was hallucinating so not only

231
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense against these sorts of attacks</font>

232
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,930
social engineering so mr. Podesta was

233
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,089
you know clicked on the link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

234
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,579
happens is now they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain access to his</font>

235
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,620
computer wherever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it could have</font>

236
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">already been on to dnc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network it could</font>

237
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,829
have been in his house it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

238
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,170
been in a hotel either<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if it's</font>

239
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:41,880
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network you dingos home or</font>

240
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,920
goes back to dnc plugs it into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnc</font>

241
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,199
network and then it starts to propagate

242
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:53,399
so what the attackers were able to take

243
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:54,959
was just a bunch of freaking emails and

244
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,500
then they went through the email and

245
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,510
then it was leaked to WikiLeaks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

246
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,320
attacker is known as gusoff or two point

247
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh who said</font>

248
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,490
he's remaining and he's not affiliated

249
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,590
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russians but based upon the</font>

250
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,990
intelligence community's assessment they

251
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,710
say is and I say it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

252
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">opened to question but I'm stating the</font>

253
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,110
facts here I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a judgment if</font>

254
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,560
he is or he is not employed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

255
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,870
Russians either way there was an effect

256
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,250
on the election of some type now there

257
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,740
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some people who say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

258
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,510
overblown that you know this sort of

259
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,800
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the whole lot right campaign</font>

260
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:36,420
which I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about in a</font>

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,400
second but they had no effect on the

262
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:46,170
election I think it's open for<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate as</font>

263
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:49,760
well you know the only defense is user

264
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,800
education if you go out look at

265
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">borschberg licks talk or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> KC</font>

266
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,209
urine on social engineering they've done

267
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,430
a really good job of talking about

268
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:08,550
defending its social engineering and you

269
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:10,640
should definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> go check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out and</font>

270
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,260
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about</font>

271
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what I talk about social engineering</font>

272
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,770
is we all have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning styles</font>

273
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:22,880
some people are visual some people are

274
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:25,170
are better listening physical etc so

275
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,640
basically what this boils down to is the

276
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">lecture is dead which is kind of funny</font>

277
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I'm setting a pure lecturing to</font>

278
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,780
you but hands-on training is a lot

279
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than listening to somebody talk</font>

280
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,430
about it Amanda think left but she had

281
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,740
some good examples of security awareness

282
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:47,930
training one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our other speakers test</font>

283
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:52,770
has basically built a security awareness

284
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:55,260
culture in her organization and you do

285
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:58,020
that by having a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal marketing</font>

286
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:01,770
campaign she makes it fun so for example

287
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:05,460
on in the summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and July they have</font>

288
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,890
cookout and the cookout is themed about

289
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,690
security awareness and you have prizes

290
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,230
and accept you know all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

291
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,030
thing security awareness is not

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,270
something you can do once

293
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,520
and it sticks if you're not you doing it

294
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,819
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on board people you're making</font>

year you're also a bleep missing the

298

point it has to be a constant<font color="#E5E5E5"> message it</font>

299
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,500
also has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a constant message</font>

300
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,380
without making people tired of the

301
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,450
message and there was a recent study

302
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:44,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">from UK saying that the people have just</font>

303
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:47,580
entered the space of malaise in what you

304
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,939
need to do a social engineer your users

305
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,800
to be more secure right you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

306
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,620
trick your users into being more secure

307
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,130
if you preach it people I mean if you

308
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:02,070
got kids<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how is it how is it</font>

309
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,439
how do they react when you preach to

them oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I've heard that before</font>

311
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,470
you know and that our users are becoming

312
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,090
that way about security awareness about

313
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,000
fishing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many times can you</font>

tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> people not to click on stuff there</font>

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,380
needs to be a better more targeted and

more sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> message as we move</font>

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,829
fishing campaign that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually pretty</font>

321
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,780
hands-on when they click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link and</font>

322
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,030
they realize they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,490

them to an awareness page where they can

325
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:01,830
read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the other thing I have to</font>

326
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:05,069
say about awareness is that you know

327
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:08,040
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave Kennedy version is if</font>

328
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,480
you if you're salesmen it makes you most

329
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,310
money in your core and your corporation

330
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,880
gets gets fist are you going to fire

331
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,470
them well he'll know you're throwing

332
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,820
you're throwing the baby off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">bathwater you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep that</font>

334
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,010
person you're going to educate that

335
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:29,240
person so it's all about education this

336
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,240
is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about learning styles</font>

337
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:36,580
so in my example of a hands-on exercise

338
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:38,979
instead of telling you what a good

339
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,080
password policy is have them develop a

340
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:43,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">good password and there's some different</font>

341
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,978
sites you can use or you could just set

342
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,509
down with them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they say well what</font>

343
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:49,289
about this password or what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

344
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:52,779
password and then also when you do your

00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:54,220
your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own penetration test you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

346
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:59,979
just go ahead probably guess their

347
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:01,989
password you also might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

348
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:05,679
about password policies and why we have

349
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:07,840
them so it's more than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying we</font>

350
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,570
need to do X it's about explaining why

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,199
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and as a result people will be</font>

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:17,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">more willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

353
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain to users that you're</font>

00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:22,659
not just guarding guarding corporate

373
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:12,909
you're pretty cool off if usually what

00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:15,009
will happen if your computer starts to

375

slow down its poorly written malware or

gets gummed up with malware so they go

<font color="#E5E5E5">buy another computer they make Walmart a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that what the former</font>

427
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:54,409
administration was trying to do was

428
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,370
trying to clarify the narrative the

429
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,270
Russians hacked

430
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:01,429
election now they didn't hack the

431
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,440
election we tried to influence elections

432
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,800
some people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did influence</font>

433
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> election whether if Vincent 2.0</font>

434
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,879
works for the Russians or not it still

435
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:16,370
happened and there has to be a reason

436
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happened and the only reason</font>

437
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can point back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to is the</font>

438
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,950
Russians are trying to influence the

439
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,300
outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our election the other thing</font>

440
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,580
is is that we're sitting around having

441
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:29,510
this conversation is enough to say that

442
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">they influence the election did we set</font>

443
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:37,309
down in 1976 and talk about how China

444
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,050
got Jimmy Carter elected no but yet I'm

445
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:43,100
sure information warfare was in play in

446
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:45,830
1976 as it is in play now information

447
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,990
warfare has gone on forever there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

448
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,629
entire units of the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> army that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

449
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,179
nothing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> information warfare so</font>

450
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,559
propaganda public opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> propaganda was</font>

451
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:56,929
a great class that I took as an

452
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,360
undergraduate what we're seeing as a

453
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:03,290
manifestation of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's sort of</font>

454
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,540
bubbled to the top and as a result it is

455
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:10,280
confused and upset a lot of people and

456
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:13,340
that in itself is the goal one of the

457
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">goals of information warfare yes you and</font>

458
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:57,620
a black<font color="#CCCCCC"> shirt yeah so in 2011 the</font>

459
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,929
Russians caught then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Secretary of State</font>

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hillary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Clinton i'm reading this back so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that people in a video can hear it of</font>

462
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:08,750
trying to promote on what rest to make

463
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,180
sure that mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Putin was not re-elected</font>

464
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,280
and that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason the</font>

465
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:19,010
motive behind this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're</font>

466
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Times the same what</font>

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,930
Bill article was written in 2011 as well

468
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:32,180
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done this for years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

469
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,290
know seeing what's familiar with the

470
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:39,700
rise of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Shah of Iran that was all</font>

471
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:44,780
cia-backed we had this word Vietnam

472
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:50,600
where basically the leaders of South

473
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:52,730
Vietnam was appointed by CIA we have

474
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:58,790
meddled in other people's politics

475
00:24:52,730 --> 00:25:01,190
forever that's what NSA CIA do that's

476
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:05,570
their job NSA's job is signal

477
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:10,550
intelligence CA his job is is covert

478
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:12,230
intelligence and human intelligence if

479
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,649
they weren't doing this they wouldn't be

480
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,690
doing their jobs so I don't think it

481
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be shocking anybody that one</font>

482
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:26,300
country is trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to influence election</font>

483
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:28,730
in another country but it's very clear

484
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:36,139
based upon the report and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also the</font>

485
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:38,960
recent testimony of the head FBI FBI

486
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,570
call me that the Russians did not

487
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,730
penetrate our election system such as

488
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,429
voter registration and voting systems

489
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,850
but they were attacked which is also

490
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:52,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably happens every day I mean if you</font>

491
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:56,449
look I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are new to</font>

492
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:58,450
security to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down even at your home</font>

493
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:01,220
network and look at your firewall logs

494
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,590
there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many automated attacks out</font>

495
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,540
there and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always somebody hammer</font>

496
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,949
and down the door we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hammer</font>

497
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:12,879
down the door now if you see a lot of

498
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,440
these and you can find some sort of

499
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,600
pattern and that's what it appears to

500
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,040
has happened here the other problem is

501
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,759
attribution you know attributions a hard

502
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,709
problem

503
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can write you know right now i could</font>

504
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:31,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">go on this computer spin up a VPS and in</font>

505
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:33,228
japan and launch attacks against

506
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:35,599
wherever in the world there go my god

507
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:37,969
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> japanese are attacking me now there</font>

508
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,339
are forensic ways of going back and

509
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:42,379
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who that was but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

510
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:45,049
always clear its many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times muddy and</font>

511
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:48,259
now what the release of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA vault is</font>

512
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:54,009
a vault<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 others they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

513
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:56,089
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are made to confuse</font>

514
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:57,829
attribution we all joke about the

515
00:26:56,089 --> 00:27:00,079
attribution dice you know I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

516
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:02,809
some let's roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attribution dice was</font>

517
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,249
it North Korea you know if we're up to

518
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:10,099
Mandy at China would have done

519
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:15,699
everything here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other issue in</font>

520
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:18,889
this case which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will raise the actual</font>

521
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:21,289
forensics was not done by the FBI on the

522
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:24,349
DNC servers or the DNC computers it was

523
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:26,690
done by cloud strike and then that

524
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:29,629
information that forensics investigation

525
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,429
was handed over to the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when call</font>

526
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:33,708
me testified before Congress they're

527
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,169
like why wasn't the FBI involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

528
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:41,179
reply was because our people said it was

529
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">just as good beware of the cyber</font>

530

531
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,609
making policy foreign policy decisions

532
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:52,190
based upon the attribution of a private

533
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:54,918
country company who was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to please</font>

534
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,979
shareholders I think there she be some

535
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,989
sort of question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and if</font>

536
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:01,579
you're a<font color="#CCCCCC"> law on for takin see you</font>

537
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:03,769
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should follow up with your own</font>

538
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:08,839
investigation the FBI is a law

539
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:11,089
enforcement agency it's scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me you</font>

540
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,948
know i'm not saying cloud striped

541

anything wrong but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just scary to me</font>

542
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:18,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can have private organization</font>

comes do forensics oh yeah well this is

544
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,459
it we know this is it because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

545
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:25,039
as good<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we could say that</font>

546

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,960
back up somewhere to the point where

571
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,840
Gawker actually got a copy of the video

572
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,450
put it on their website and under the

575
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:47,570
the FBI to come seized our servers so

576
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:51,889
then it became a free speech issue so

577
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:54,260
chanology was the first real hacktivism

578
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,270
as far as anonymous cos there's other

579
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:00,379
hacktivists operations out there there

580
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:06,820
was there were denial of service attacks

583
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,070
using their planes to deport immigrants

584

in their mind right but in in the in the

593
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,760

some laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you don't have to be a</font>

600
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:11,330

601
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,950
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WikiLeaks controversy where you</font>

602
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:17,149
could no longer give money to WikiLeaks

606
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,250
to the KKK and the neo-nazi

607
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,399
organizations of America what's the

608
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:31,030
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between them and WikiLeaks</font>

609
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,320
and this also goes back to the whole

610
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,620
information wants to be free which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

611
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,950
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic values of hacker</font>

612
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,989
culture right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so WikiLeaks is making</font>

613
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,500

617
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,710
basically took the meadows in their own

618
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,470
hands and watch denial-of-service

619
00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:03,980
attacks against these a MasterCard

620
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:05,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">PayPal and took them off line in</font>

621
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,580
Charleston at that time I was working<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

622
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">a law firm it actually knocked our</font>

623
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,129
network offline so I lost communications

624
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,930
with two of our offices couldn't

625
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,700
communicate with them because the denial

626
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,830
service attack was affecting other

627
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,780
network activities if you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

628
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,480
capital streak that had lunch you could

629
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,670
not use a credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> or bank card</font>

630
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,580
because all the point-of-sale systems

631
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,440
have been knocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> offline so this took</font>

632
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:37,480
over this happened over a course of a

633
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:39,800
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> days wiki paypal mastercard and</font>

634

these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all reversed their decision</font>

635
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,690
you could give money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> WikiLeaks again</font>

636
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:50,050
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hooray we're heroes of the</font>

you know three or four maybe 20 people

715
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,600
down the line they've got some narrative

718
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:38,720
did have an effect but not a direct

719
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,368
effect on the election<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's pretty</font>

720
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:47,149
obvious where does we've live<font color="#CCCCCC"> ukraine</font>

725
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:06,380
the rebels in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ukraine they get along so</font>

726
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,210
I'm not saying we've works for the

727
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,320
Russian government that they are pretty

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> lined and there are other people</font>

729
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,940
pretty well lined as well who may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

730
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct agents to the Russian government</font>

731
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,390
that they have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as agents</font>

732
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,460
the Russian government and the weirdest

733
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:26,150
thing to me as the people who were

734
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:28,060
formally identified as anonymous hate

735
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:33,320
this report

736
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:39,200
they say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guccifer 2.0 is just some</font>

737
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:42,470
hacker that's fine and they also say

738
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,020
that WikiLeaks is just telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposing</font>

739
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:47,330
the truth that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also true but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

740
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,330
can't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that a vacuum and not</font>

741
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:53,740
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an election was effected</font>

742
00:37:50,330 --> 00:38:03,910
through the leaks through the trolling

743
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:03,910
web defacements on the use of memes in

744
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">December 2016 crowds cloud strike</font>

745
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:19,210
actually found malware that was used

746
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,890
which was similar called fancy bear

747
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,470
which resulted in heavy losses of

howitzers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ukrainian war with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">was they were able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there was</font>

751
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:38,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically an Android or an iPhone app</font>

752
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,430
where you could use to target<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">artillery</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that cut the number of the</font>

amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to calculate you know how</font>

755
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,180
high you<font color="#CCCCCC"> raised the barrel and all that</font>

756
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:53,540
sort of thing and they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

757
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:56,569
this malware to target the artillery men

758
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:00,640
who were using it and the result is

759
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,640
according cloud strike heavily losses

760
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:06,860
and that was rushing back because it was

761
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,580
originally these were originally Russian

762
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:13,310
artillery the app was written by Russian

763
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:17,299
so they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically weaponized it and</font>

764
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:19,130
he used it and the point of really of

765
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,340
this is just to point out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

766
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:26,650
Russians are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid to use these</font>

767
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:32,320
sort of cyber means information warfare

768
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:37,400
etc in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve their goals</font>

769
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,900
don't have any questions this is worse

770
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,050
than teaching the afternoon everyone's

771
