research done by a company called baker

20

of the engagements that they had with

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,548
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and clients I think is</font>

26
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,350
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 57%</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> total of the of the</font>

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,329
breaches that they were called in on

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,839
we're attributable in some form or

29
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:08,008
fashion to human error it breaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,060
more specifically into these separate

00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,279
categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're shown on this slide</font>

thirty-one percent being fishing hacking

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,380
now we're twenty four percent of

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,760
the incidence being a specific employee

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,470

your laptop and your unlock car and

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,430
someone comes along takes it you had

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,220
proprietary info on the laptop fourteen

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,460
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incidents were vendor related</font>

41
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:39,329
eight were actual internal employee

theft meaning somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> stole data they</font>

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,690
should have had access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or expanded</font>

44

45
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,100
percent was lost or improper disposal of

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,100
information so things like

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:59,570
decommissioning old hard drives without

48
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:02,339
wiping them things like that right the

49
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,670
even in all of these incidents<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,930
underlying<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is baker</font>

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,179
hostetler is able to determine that it

52
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">was all human error related when they</font>

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:17,400
really dug down into it to finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,929
root cause so it was rarely even in his

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,610
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all the breaches that they looked</font>

56
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,600
at it was rarely attributable than

57
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:30,470
anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an oday being used against</font>

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:33,500
the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was rarely you know</font>

59
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,420
specific to even even to malware or

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,310
phishing attacks those though fishing

61
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:44,010
spear phishing campaigns things like

62
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,900
that tended to be more frequent the the

63
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,390
again the underlying cause<font color="#E5E5E5"> even those</font>

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,150
scenarios is human error<font color="#E5E5E5"> right somebody</font>

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,170
is clicking a link they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

66
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,600
putting their credentials in somewhere

67
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:03,859
that they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be whatever the case</font>

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be so I started looking into that</font>

69
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,850
this aspect of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> carried</font>

70
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:13,890
around 2013 and you know upon coming

71
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,560
across this research that<font color="#E5E5E5"> baker</font>

72
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">hostetler did and doing a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit my</font>

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,479
own research<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of that I wanted to</font>

74
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out a way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could exploit</font>

75
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,400
that for my own game bug bounties

76
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,700
I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a little bit of work on the</font>

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,080
companies like hacker one which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

78
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,659
is like basically like a hosted platform

79
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,840
for companies to run bug bounty program

80
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,940
I had worked through them a little bit

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early stages but hadn't</font>

82
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,150
really dug into getting it involved in

83
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,310
bug bounties when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized that the</font>

84
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,190
human error element is a large

85
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,680
contributor to two breaches I thought to

86
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">myself well how can i how can i exploit</font>

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:07,410
the human error aspect of breaches to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

88
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:15,140
a benefit to me as a bug bounty hunter

89
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:15,140
as a researcher as a hacker and so I

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,730
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what I wanted to do was</font>

91
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,280
you know find a way to actually that

92
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,960
like I said but how could I find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,570
to exploit that looking at things like

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,630
default configurations was one of the

95
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:34,260
first things i put on my to-do list

96
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:35,940
default' figs default passwords exposed

97
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,950
services where they shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

98
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,660
things like listening on ports you know

99
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:44,130
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> public-facing interfaces things like</font>

100
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,800
that on services such as Mongo Apache

101
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,219
you know looking for exposed svn get

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,210
servers where they shouldn't be these

103
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all things that were kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of flying</font>

104
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,570
through my head trying to figure out to

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,910
you know the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach for this so</font>

106
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,880
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I do I built the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> project's</font>

107
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,410
called heap so what heap is the front

108
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:13,010
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the back end that tied together</font>

109
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:17,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some fun stuff so heap basically</font>

110
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:20,070
works like this you go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

111
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,260
interface hear you tell it what you want

112
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at so the way I've been using it</font>

113
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:29,730
most prevalently is giving it a cider

114
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,730
block right so you know yeah cider for

115
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:37,470
those that aren't familiar it's like a

116
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:40,700
10 1000 / 16 for example which is a

117
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,700
basically subnet

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,620
a subnet definition so you can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

119
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,969
cider you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

120
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">name if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want look at one host</font>

121
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,830
or you can give it you know a range of

122
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,780
IP addresses individually and what this

123
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,780
does is it plugs into our monitoring

124
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,059
interface stores it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font>

125
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,789
information in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanning database and</font>

126
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,220
then kicks off a back in instance for

127
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,290
that particular that host if it's an

128
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,800
individual hoster it spawns off threads

129
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:16,660
if it's a if it's a cider or multiple

130
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,600
hosts and what I do is on the back end

131
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,910
there's some scanning engine

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,270
functionality built in using masks can

133
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,820
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it starts</font>

134
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,330
probing these either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the host or the</font>

135
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:34,300
actual the full block of ips that you've

136
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,000
configured that you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor or</font>

137
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:42,430
scan against and it builds a snapshot in

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">time representation of what services are</font>

139
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:50,170
publicly available I'm on that block at

140
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,840
that particular point in time I started

141
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,930
off when I did this looking for specific

142
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I was looking for mongodb</font>

143
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:01,380
instances that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and that did</font>

144
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:05,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">not require a username or password</font>

145
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:09,100
looking for Apache servers or other web

146
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,020
servers that were open indexed so there

147
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,270
was no like index.html you go to when

148
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,039
you get a directory listing looking for

149
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,150
open FTP servers that did not require

150

152
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,969

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:40,690
off to view the entries within the

156
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:42,340
reddest instance at that point and so in

157
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,810

error<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements jackpot soda fountain so</font>

168
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,820
in this instance there was an open

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apache instance or excuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me an open</font>

mongo DB server that was found and had

171
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:34,160
no auth required and you can see it so

172
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,269
it gives me basically the the host the

173
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,380
location what the actual vulnerable

174
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:45,079
instance was server type and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

175
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">was replicated locally on my scanning</font>

177
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,729

178
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,560
instances or open register instances or

179
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,140
Apache etc anything that it found

180
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,170
basically configured to replicate all of

181
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,120
the all of the findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> locally stick of</font>

182
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:14,029
reference back for bug reporting

183
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:16,760
purposes so this when I first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

184
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:19,130
doing this I focused very very

185
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,579
specifically on a small number of

186
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,750
targets that I chose just kind of

187
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:29,800
randomly from the the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts and um</font>

188
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:33,829
and the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were within a</font>

189
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,020
very small list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies that ran</font>

190
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:38,479
their own individual bug bounty programs

191
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,279
not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of hacker one or</font>

192
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,750
the other bug bounty platforms that are

193
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:48,079
out there and immediately saw a large

194
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,620
large large large number of results I

195
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:57,910
think in the first week of scanning and

196
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,910
and and targeting I had something like

197
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:06,830
157,000 results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the target tables</font>

198
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:09,800
over for just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for companies</font>

199
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,780
and it was a it I think the actual

200
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,930
address space that worked out to you was

201
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:22,850
something like a / 24 which is crazy if

202
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:26,689
you think about it so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some of</font>

203
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:31,780
the some of the notable findings that I

204
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:34,490
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come across here excuse me</font>

205
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,579
the first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found that made me</font>

206
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:42,830
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> go oh my god what have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i done is</font>

207
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:48,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came across a open Mongo instance that</font>

208
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:51,200
was in LD clouds address space le cloud

209
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:55,250
is a part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alibaba and it's similar to</font>

210
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,590
its basically alibaba's ec2 alternative

211
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:05,240
or their their answer to ec to amazon's

212
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:09,260
cloud cloud platform but so in that

213
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,880
Mongo instance when I took a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

214
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,230
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it consisted of was four or five</font>

215
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,320
fields and they consist of things like

216
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,560
public key private key and balance I

217
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,060
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well what could this be</font>

218
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at it i'm a i'm a big fan of</font>

219
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">bitcoin as use Bitcoin for i think i</font>

220
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,989
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in late two thousand ten so i</font>

221
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,220
got involved so big fan immediately

222
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,350
recognized that some of these addresses

223
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:39,770
look like Bitcoin addresses so started

224
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,140
plugging in some of the addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

225
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,640
balance ball at balance checker and and

226
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,970
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the balance that was in</font>

227
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,220
being shown in relation to the public

228
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,510
and private keys was representative of

229
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual balance on the Bitcoin</font>

230
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,330
blockchain for that particular address

231
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,360
attempted to import one of those those

232
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,710
those keys that had a balance locally

233
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,920
using the private key that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed</font>

234
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:10,940
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked so overall when i when i</font>

235
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:20,060
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these numbers together I had let's</font>

236
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:20,390
see 240 1559 total<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin that were at</font>

237
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,839
my

238
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">bosal with no encrypted key for the</font>

239
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,050
private key which means it was all

240
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,970
public I could import every one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

241
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,150
addresses to my own control locally and

242
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,280
I would own those<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin which is a</font>

243
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,140
massive massive percentage of the actual

244
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,390
bitcoins in circulation for a single

245
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:43,189
entity hope that scared me because if I

246
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:47,600
found this special the other people

247
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,220
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this and this was when</font>

248
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:56,470
I found this particular instance it was

249
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:59,660
late 2013 early 2014 so it was right

250
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,150
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of right during when showdown put</font>

251
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,240
out there open Mongo report which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

252
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,890
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 49,000 instances i think</font>

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,650
they noted<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put that report</font>

254
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:14,750
out in late 2013 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i reported this to</font>

255
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company the particular it was a</font>

256
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bitcoin exchange out of a particular</font>

257
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Asian country yeah so I reported it to</font>

258
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,930
them I didn't take the Bitcoin and go

259
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,370
buy an island somewhere which I strongly

260
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:37,430
considered for a long period of time but

261
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:41,240
I reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him they were extremely</font>

262
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,680
thankful as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine that could</font>

263
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,110
have that would definitely destroyed

264
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,819
them and and a lot of people's finances

265
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,070
I think anyway so yeah they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

266
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,370
lock down in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mago incidence state what</font>

267
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,100
they had done is installed Mongo on

268
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,770
their production server which had a

269
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:04,430
internet-facing in that facing interface

270
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:07,310
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facing interface and when you</font>

271
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:11,989
do like apps you know apt install mongo

272
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:14,869
DB for example or my go server by

273
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,920
default that's going to bind 20000 which

274
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,120
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy into all available</font>

275
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,280
interfaces on your on your server right

276
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,390
and that's what they had done basically

277
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,920
just apt installed app install Mongo and

278
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:33,680
started using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their backup of</font>

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,979
their active active customer keystore so

280
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,479
forth

281
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,010
all the customers all of the addresses

282
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were generated in their system for</font>

283
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,290
them to use as well as their

284
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:48,590
cold-storage wallets were backed up to

285
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:50,480
this location as well so right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

286
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,100
human error again right the whoever the

287
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,660
sysadmin was that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for</font>

288
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,700
setting that up as I've done and I'm

289
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,949
sure anybody else who's done any package

290
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,870
management on any Linux or UNIX systems

291
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,520
has done past you just install the

292
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,970
package and assume everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

293
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes without verifying what the</font>

294
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,440
default configures actually doing in

295
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:18,199

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,539

and all of the imei is for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

available in this public facing mondo

348
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:12,340
instance 50 gigabytes worth so in theory

349
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:14,739
that's 50 gigabytes worth of cell

350
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,988
account information I could I or anybody

351
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:20,139
could have snagged up and cloned off

352
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:22,359
onto another device is just too d 2g and

353
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:23,830
began using a free cellular for life

354
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:27,820
basically at that point if I wanted to

355
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:30,070
so both new star and this Mexican

356
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,918
oilfield company were we're appreciative

357
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,369
as well they both pay me a finder's fee

358
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:39,909
neither one had existing bug bounty

359
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:42,970
programs but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found is that even</font>

360
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:46,119
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company doesn't have a program if I</font>

361
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:49,359
come to them with a large enough find or

362
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:53,220
such as these they're more than happy to

363
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:56,349
pay me thank you very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> fee just for</font>

365
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:03,100
at the time and and

366
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:09,220
not you know not keeping it for my own

367
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:11,740
use so there's tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other instances I</font>

368
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,170
can think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of since we're on Marshall</font>

369
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,500
University's campus here I did find

370
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,090
several open not Mongo instances but

371
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,620
there were a couple of reticence ensues

372
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,970
and some a ton of open indexed Apache

373
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,389
servers that I've found that had

374
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:31,000
sensitive information on it in Marshall

375
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:35,800
which were reported and fixed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">in 2015 but they were reported but again</font>

377
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:42,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that contain things like SSL public</font>

378
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:45,160
private keys for web servers there were

379
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:49,060
some user credentials there were some

380
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:53,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSH keys again there were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several source</font>

381
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:57,159
cord source code repositories again with

382
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:59,700
user credentials exposed there were more

383
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">than one instance I found local and</font>

384
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:09,760
remote file inclusion vulnerabilities

385
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:12,189
and several open<font color="#E5E5E5"> FTP servers that were</font>

386
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,700
misconfigured so it's not you know

387
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,740
having an ftp server that has anonymous

388
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,020
access enabled is not necessarily a bad

389
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,090
thing but it's all in how it's been

390
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,250
configured to run right so if you have a

391
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,510
Miss configuration base configuration of

392
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,990
that ftp server that you've allowed

393
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,670
anonymous access to and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

394
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,290
CLS that aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> correct on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

395
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,880
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you're going to run into trouble</font>

396
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,350
where people have access to information

397
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should have access to as a result</font>

398
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,929
of that human error and configuration

399
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:45,340
perfect example of that is a particular

400
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:48,610
NASA related entity that I got an alert

401
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:52,419
for from my from<font color="#E5E5E5"> project heat that said</font>

402
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,979
hey I found this open ftp server and it

403
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,680
seemed to have four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

404
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,180
naz's attached to it and it looks like

405
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of data expose go check</font>

406
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:07,420
this out logged into it and it turns out

407
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:10,000
it was a JPL system and the system was

408
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,000
configured with anonymous FTP access but

409
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,960
it was configured to have a base root of

410
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,529
/

411
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,450
so it's a window system and on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

412
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:23,140
system with this particular ftp server

413
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:27,039
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> running if you put / excuse me</font>

414
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,390
as the as the file system route that

415
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,669
gives you access as though you're

416
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,289
looking at my computer when you're into

417
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:34,450
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're actually log into</font>

418
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:37,830
the ftp so you can go to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

419
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,240
configured disks on the system so

420
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,928
because they had the anonymous account

421
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,890
created and they didn't specify that it

422
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:50,740
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be locked down to a specific</font>

423
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,630
guest or anonymous pass on the system it

424
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,600
also gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to you to slash my</font>

425
00:22:52,630 --> 00:23:01,179
computer view and so what that did is it

426
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:05,168
exposed some very very sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nass</font>

427
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,580
servers within JPL JPL itself is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

428
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:09,250
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be exposed on the internet</font>

429
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,770
anywhere so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the ftp server</font>

430
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,750
was open was a problem problem in of

431
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,059
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the Miss configuration of the</font>

432
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,460
anonymous access wasn't even larger

433
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,559
concern for them at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point because</font>

434
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,100
it meant anybody within the organization

435
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had access internally even if the</font>

436
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,199
external facing situation is ignored

437
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,720
anybody could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have connected to that</font>

438
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,440
even if they didn't have specific rights

439
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,690
or need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for what was on these</font>

440
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,880
mass servers they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have accessed it</font>

441
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,190
anonymously through the ftp and access

442
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,480
that information or destroyed it because

443
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:48,880
it had read write access actually so

444
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,740
thankfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm have contact with gov</font>

445
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,520
that is able to report that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and get</font>

446
00:23:50,740 --> 00:24:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fixed which was which is good thing</font>

447
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:03,840
so one of the more funny findings with a

448
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,950
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an RBM Burger King</font>

449
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:11,770
point-of-sale system that was logging to

450
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:13,570
a mongo instance in ec2 it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

451
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,990
located<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Central America somewhere I</font>

452
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,059
wasn't able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out who specifically</font>

453
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:22,870
owned the<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems unfortunately so I</font>

454
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:25,510
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't I couldn't get that</font>

455
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:28,060
one fixed my reported the ec2 though who

456
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:31,900
know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> would to amaz</font>

457
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:33,850
who would be aware of who he the owner

458
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,440
of the instance was in which this stuff

459
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,240
was being dumped too so they were able

460
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch with them and work</font>

461
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,660
backwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out where it</font>

462
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:46,090
was coming from to lock it down shortly

463
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,090
after reporting this one it disappeared

464
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:51,879
so so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did get it</font>

465
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,169
fixed but that was a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny one</font>

466
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:05,980
looking at people's lunch orders and

467
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:08,710
stuff as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they rolled in so I the one of</font>

468
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,780
the last findings I'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is</font>

469
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:16,530
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is from google itself</font>

470
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:19,720
actually in it was early last year 2016

471
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">I realized I hadn't actually ever looked</font>

472
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,980
at targeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google specifically they do</font>

473
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:29,920
have their own independent bug bounty

474
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:34,060
program and so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they</font>

475
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a hosting platform set up</font>

476
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,889
with some dedicated space within their

477
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:44,560
their own address space for public

478
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:48,420
hosting and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay so I set</font>

479
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to monitor their address space and</font>

480
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,360
you know within a couple of hours of

481
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,800
actually kicking off that instance I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

482
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,770
an alert for them and I was it go

483
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:02,350
interesting the address that it came

484
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to you was this 835 dot 1977 to IP</font>

485
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:10,110
address so if you who is a google web

486
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:15,010
server you get back specific information

487
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:16,149
on the owning a s that's dependent on

488
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,750
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it's a public-facing</font>

489
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:21,160
system or if it's an internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> use system</font>

490
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,950
at Google for their corporate

491
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,780
infrastructure or corporate purposes and

492
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,940
in this particular IP address and I who

493
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that it came back with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal</font>

494
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:34,540
infrastructure use a s information which

495
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,840
made it seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be a</font>

496
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:41,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">good one for me so taking a look at the</font>

497
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mongo instance that I've found here</font>

498
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,490
the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came that popped up</font>

499
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,160
immediately was there was an admin user

500
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was configured and there was an at</font>

501
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,080
google.com email address that was

502
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,210
configured with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> password that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not</font>

503
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,120
encrypted and not encoded<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

504
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:08,740
simple string that was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for</font>

505
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:12,110
the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plain text string so that</font>

506
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:16,190
was interesting me so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

507
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:19,340
particular there's a there's a another

508
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,830
IP address down here in this Mongo

509
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:25,490
instance was stored a hostname of 74

510
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,679
blah blah blah this IP address and this

511
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,200
IP address it when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I browse to it was a</font>

512
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,840
google search appliance and so I thought

513
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,330
us interesting it had the admin and

514
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,030
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> plain text credentials here so I</font>

515
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,679
tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> that admin then credentials there</font>

516
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,210
and it let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into the admin user on</font>

517
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,640
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interesting so</font>

518
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,620
it's a google internal internally own

519
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">google system the use for internal</font>

520
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:51,050
purposes using these credentials and

521
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,400
they're valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so started looking</font>

522
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,960
through the configuration on this google

523
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,640
search appliance and it turns out it was

524
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,820
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their demo appliances that they</font>

525
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,390
use when they're demoing for corporate

526
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">or gov customers and some of the</font>

527
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,890
information that was in this google

528
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">search appliance was very very sensitive</font>

529
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:12,440
that was it was being actively used as a

530
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:16,160
demo system for some defense contracting

531
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,050
companies which was scary looking at it

532
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,580
I got scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an exit that it I</font>

533
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:24,320
don't want knocks on the door saw Renny

534
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:27,649
van pulling up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

535
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:33,110
the fence stuff it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary but so</font>

536
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:34,550
having seen that I started poking around

537
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,050
a little bit in the Google Search

538
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:39,620
Appliance itself and I got logged into

539
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:45,350
here and was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a way to get</font>

540
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:47,419
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to get into the actual show the</font>

541
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:51,610
system shell on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system which isn't</font>

542
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,410
normally available and basically a

543
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:56,469
remote

544
00:28:53,410 --> 00:29:00,850
a remote code execution bug that I found

545
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:03,430
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> login page gave me access to the</font>

546
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,360
system itself so it's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pop a</font>

547
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,560
reverse shell back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself and then</font>

548
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,790
start playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> around on their system and</font>

549
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:15,399
so they had this this demo google search

550
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:18,490
appliance is connected both to their

551
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,620
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> google corporate land and as well</font>

552
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the internet obviously for demo</font>

553
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:28,350
purposes and so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to start</font>

554
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,450
spidering my way back<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the google</font>

555
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:35,860
corporate HQ network as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of this</font>

556
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,600
configured admin password on the Google

557
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,560
Search Appliance this password was one

558
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:46,080
of their internally used system

559
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:49,450
passwords for commonly<font color="#E5E5E5"> used accounts</font>

560
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,550
that so it was a shared password

561
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,100
basically they used it across all of the

562
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,419
shared systems and most of their

563
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,340
infrastructure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to start</font>

564
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:02,410
sneaking through their internal ad

565
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,510
infrastructure yeah so basically

566
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything within Google I could have you</font>

567
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:12,700
know I owned at that point this one this

568
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,740
one was a bad one that again Google is

569
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,860
very appreciative for the four for the

570
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,730
report here they paid very well for this

571
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,740
bug and we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> receive it</font>

572
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:29,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fix it which is always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

573
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:31,620
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so so again the common thread</font>

574
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,090
through all of these findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

575
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,889
human error it always<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes down to</font>

576
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,360
human error it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to come</font>

577
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,130
down to human error humans are the

578
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">weakest link when it comes to</font>

579
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:50,020
information security so how do you fix

580
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:52,240
that the best way the best ways that

581
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,970
I've found and<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to take away</font>

582
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:00,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the work I've done with sheep over</font>

583
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:03,550
the past couple of years is is awareness

584
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:06,360
and training is basically the best your

585
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:09,300
best defense you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

586
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,699
you have to train your users your

587
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,850
employees your anybody that's going to

588
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:20,190
be accessing your systems you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

589
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">let them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that that while you know</font>

striding perfect perfection you know

591
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,120
accidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> do happen and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid</font>

592
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:35,280
to to call attention to accidents or or

593
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:38,909
or situations in which they made a

594

597
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:48,120
really comes you to tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

598
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,920
not be scared to do that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

599
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,260
want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> admit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to mistakes so that</font>

600

603
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,700
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you did this is what could</font>

have been done better so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

607
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,170
training training training I try to

608
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,350
approach any any scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get brought</font>

609
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:21,060
to my attention either via this project

610
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:23,159
or in consulting with clients anytime

611
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:26,399
anything's brought up I always make a

612
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,770
mental note and later a physical note to

613
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,230
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from how can we</font>

614
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:38,639
learn from this perspective which is

618
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:48,540
specifically related to fishing is you

619
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,280
have to have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do simulation</font>

620

training right so you need to do

00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,330
throughout the year periodically whether

622
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:56,970
it's once a quarter whatever is best for

repeated exposure to unexpected

way the other two key aspects that need

to be addressed from from looking at
