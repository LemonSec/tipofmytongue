last talk in the information security

track of the day so what I'm going to

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today is something that</font>

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,500
bothers<font color="#CCCCCC"> me this is a rant I've given</font>

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,750
this talk a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times before and I</font>

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,190
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> get never get through it before</font>

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,680
there's a outburst in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,050
did get through a hacker con but this is

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,410
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't agree with</font>

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,839
me on and that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's room for</font>

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:10,080
disagreement there is not room in our

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,479
community for backstabbing you know just

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,900
the public disagreements to happen

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,950
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> are being done under trolling</font>

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,720
but there's some real nasty

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,540
disagreements that take place in our

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,789
community also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,920
profession that goes on social media and

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:33,740
whines about stuff constantly everything

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,740
whines about everything so disclaimer

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,699
even though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> teaching martial DS do not</font>

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,710
this talk does not represent the

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,689
official opinions of Marshall University

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,139
it's my own opinion so anything that I

35
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:53,369
say today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that's stupid it's on my</font>

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,380
own accord so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a profession well</font>

37
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,170
to according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to google profession is a</font>

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,658
paid occupation especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font>

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,070
involves prolonged training and formal

40
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,960
qualification so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> oughtta we all sort</font>

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">of come from a lot of this room came</font>

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,258
from a hacker background where we

43
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,299
basically follow it around a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,750
other hackers until we figured out what

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,730
we were doing

46
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,320
then we're hackers right<font color="#E5E5E5"> although some</font>

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,590
people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that still not hacker but</font>

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,280
that's cool we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have that discussion</font>

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,480
too so we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,800
difference between education and

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,929
training what I'm going to focus on

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,780
today is education so training is what

53
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,940
we got through this apprenticeship<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,750
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of informal apprenticeship hanging</font>

55
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,030
out on IRC<font color="#E5E5E5"> hanging out on IRC reading</font>

56
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,970
man pages reading documentation right

57
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,890
it's your sets of self it's a self

58
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,500
education that's training but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is not</font>

59
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:52,720
education in the purest form you know as

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,510
Dave Kennedy says we're a young industry

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,520
and this is straight from one updated

62
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,350
slides sorry Dave I guess if I give get

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,959
the source of the information it's not

64
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:10,540
plagiarism I don't want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> accused of</font>

65
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:13,510
plagiarism so we I mean if you look at

66
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,299
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> deaf constitute as 1993 that's</font>

67
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,470
really not that long ago the big scheme

68
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,140
of things I think there have probably

69
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,910
been other professions around like

70
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,190
doctors<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lawyers for a little bit</font>

71
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer than that so we sort of get get a</font>

72
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,200
pass in some ways I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaches</font>

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,090
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> every bigger every year this is a</font>

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing industry because we've not</font>

75
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,130
figured out how the stuff breaches the

76
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,830
every breach is the biggest one history

77
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a problem so we suck as an</font>

78
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,239
industry we need to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way forward</font>

79
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:51,850
forward attribution bingo you know

80
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,480
attributions hard and we really

81
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,910
shouldn't be using crappy attribution to

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,350
make foreign policy and unfortunately

83
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,100
that's what's happened for the last few

84
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,049
years so education is a lifelong process

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,660
and education you lean meat usually

86
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,269
means formal learning so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

87
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,850
you come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> college you're supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,489
leave being a well-rounded person you

89
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,978
spend two years studying how you know

90
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,019
how to write how to publicly speak you

91
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:24,400
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that in training training is</font>

92
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:26,080
very focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vocation so that's</font>

93
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,030
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the difference between education</font>

94
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,490
and training

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,809
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question the value of a</font>

96
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,010
college degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have degrees in</font>

97
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,350
political science and<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalism you</font>

98
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,909
know and I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adrienne says you know</font>

99
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,790
you should get a stem degree or you're

100
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,800
going you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to make any money</font>

101
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,480
and quite frankly I would not trade my

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:54,600
liberal arts education for anything in

103
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:58,020
the world but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I came a hacker</font>

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,820
through training not education but yet

105
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,710
without that educational background I

106
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,099
could have not have gotten into whatever

107
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,880
I wanted to do so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19th</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> century</font>

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,650
you became a lawyer by apprentice in

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,120
with another lawyer right you follow the

110
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,820
law<font color="#E5E5E5"> year-round till you knew what you</font>

111
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,540
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and boom your lawyer that's</font>

112
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,599
sort of how hackers have been made up to

113
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:26,630
this point you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Johnnie Cochran has</font>

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:30,990
a law degree when you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your lawyer</font>

115
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,610
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you retain a lawyer I</font>

116
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost said detain a lawyer but that's a</font>

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,290
whole other<font color="#E5E5E5"> story with you if you go to</font>

118

lawyer you need their personal their

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,720
professional services you're going to

120
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,729
probably go on their website so you

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,200
waiting with law school you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that they are professionals</font>

129
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:07,200
right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have that nympho</font>

130

set we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have training you know we have</font>

131
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,840
training like we have these talks we

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,430
have offensive security training I am an

133
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,020
LS CP for example black hat training but

134
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,880
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> training and education are</font>

135
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,990
different once again beating that dead

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,729
horse so we're changing industry if

137
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,919
those seconds are changing in this

138
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:33,630
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security if you want to</font>

139
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:37,169
call it that drink for is a changing

140
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,330
industry and for those of people who

141
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,770
became you know system administrators

142
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,960
who became

143
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:48,948
security security consultants how we got

144
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,419
to where we are today is<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than</font>

145
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,340
my students for example they're going to

146
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,530
get degrees in digital forensics and

147
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,219

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">right you have a beginning point</font>

167
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:54,180
pre-engagement you have telligence

168
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,359
gathering you know you have steps that

169
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">you follow as a professional and if</font>

170
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,529
you're not following<font color="#E5E5E5"> these steps there's</font>

171
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:06,810
some question about if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

172
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:09,029
professional or not these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are community</font>

173
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:14,099
adopted standards they're not adopted by

174
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:18,360
everybody but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it holds us to a to a</font>

175
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:20,310
standard believe me there's a lot of

176
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,909
unprofessional penetration testers out

177
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:27,569
there you can go on Fiverr and hire

178
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:29,310
somebody to test your website i'm not

179
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure i'd like to have a penetration test</font>

180
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,740
but from somebody on fiber or<font color="#E5E5E5"> craigslist</font>

181
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,159

182
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:42,599
someone off the web to break into my web

183
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,029
site so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the cissp in our</font>

184
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,230
community I don't know cissp is the best

185
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,439
thing in the world but it's better than

186
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,930
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't have a cissp there</font>

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,300
are people in the room who do it's a way

188
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:59,310
of saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you have to</font>

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:02,790
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssps so you have one health</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

as well as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one okay now forgot</font>

191
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,410
what's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> man so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better than</font>

192
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,959
nothing in that it gives you sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

193
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,439
benchmark of the had this this this

194
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:17,910
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge in this field so</font>

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore i'm a professional it's better</font>

196
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing Kevin Johnson's actually said</font>

197
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,469
that what we need to do is a bar

198
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:29,010
association for security professionals

199
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,839
where your peers test you in some way or

200
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,810
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way and that's basically</font>

201
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,339
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> cssp is but he says it needs to be</font>

202
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:40,649
deeper and I think that he's on the

203
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:42,149
right track so well there's a lot you

204
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,540
know there's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of new people</font>

205
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,070
new blood on the on the is<font color="#CCCCCC"> C squared</font>

206
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,649
board and I think they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do</font>

207
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,570
better one of the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is my</font>

208
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">students come to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what and I want</font>

209
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a cissp and I'm like we can't even</font>

210
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,810
set for the test<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't have</font>

211
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:02,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prerequisite experience to set for</font>

212
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the test I hold the security plus i'm</font>

213
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,570
not a big fan of a security plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

214
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,690
even less of a fantasy eh please

215
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,910
ec-council don't sue me but those tests

216
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,770
are about taking a test it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about</font>

217
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,140
actually having knowledge and

218
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,100
unfortunately a lot of those test

219
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,779
questions are so dated that you really

220
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to learn the wrong answer in order</font>

221
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:32,640
to pass one so accrediting professionals

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,640
step step one is education step two is

223
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,490
training hands-on training you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

224
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,939
both have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to middle</font>

225
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,680
management right well speak well

226
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,660
understand world history if nothing else

227
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,910
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more interesting cocktail parties</font>

228
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,089
and you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have training</font>

229
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:56,370
hands-on training you know there are

230
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:57,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are some cyber security programs</font>

231
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,820
out there where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get hands-on</font>

232
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,989
you talk about things that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,250
know but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually do them</font>

234
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,140
you'll actually break into a computer

235
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,160
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do forensic you talk</font>

236
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it</font>

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,490
you take tests on it but that is not

238
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,290
being a well-rounded education and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

239
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,629
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps for lifelong</font>

240
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,790
learning and cissp sets you up for that

241
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,310
mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have to do continuing</font>

242
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,300
education credits if you're a lawyer you

243
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,888
have to do cpe i'm searching legal

244
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,719
education credits for your doctor you

245
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do continuing education credits</font>

246
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,899
and we as a profession needs to do

247
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,769
continuing education and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> lucky</font>

248
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to have these community driven</font>

249
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:45,959
conferences where you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

250
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,209
that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lifelong learning that</font>

251
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:52,609
that's also on top of your formal

252
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,609
education so it's a blended approach I

253
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,709
just stated all that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

259
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,860

264
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,240
take me a little bit more seriously and

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,888
we have a stake here in our program we'd

266
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,529
like to see it move forward so I started

267
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,230

need a degree to do what we do in the

351
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">future you're going to need a degree to</font>

353
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,199

354
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,700
baseline the cissp is pretty good but

355
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,480
you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience to get it</font>

356
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:04,209
it's the same the people become doctors

357
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,670
without degrees do people become law you

358
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,870
know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guess if you watch catch</font>

me if you can you can be anything

360
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:22,059
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a degree but we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

361
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:27,550
to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of concrete the</font>

362
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:29,340
concrete benchmarks to meet in order say

363
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:33,520
that you're an information security

364
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,350
professional does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone disagree I'm</font>

365
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,870
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Socratic yes you in the black</font>

366
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">shirt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

367
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:55,780
so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think your doctor should have</font>

368
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:56,980
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I understand what</font>

369
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,200
you're saying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll disagree with</font>

370
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,450
you but are you can you be a

371
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,110
professional without having some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

372
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:16,960
professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional accreditation</font>

373
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:18,969
the cissp do that yeah but when our

374
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,440
industry gets so big we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

375
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,060
know each other by our capabilities

376
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,590
because there's going to be so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

377
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,889
us that we won't know each other yes

378
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,889
John

379
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:10,300
yeah i agree with you right the

380
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">stratification or the skill and I think</font>

381
00:19:10,300 --> 00:20:03,250
the skill will always be more important

382
00:19:11,890 --> 00:20:05,350
Yeah Yeah right right right I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I all</font>

383
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,970
now I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if we're going to be</font>

384
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,149
a profession we have to have some sort

385
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">of professional credentialing that's</font>

386
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,050
first step you need a degree there are

387
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,909
those who say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't need to agree do</font>

388
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,149
much of anything you don't needed you

389
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,730
need a degree to be a police officer I

390
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,260
think you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one you have to</font>

391
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,950
have a high school degree now to join

392
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,379
your army so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

393
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,940
the standards are and set them to me I

394
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,190
think college degree is important

395
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,500
because I have two of them and I teach

396
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,120
and higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> education but you know</font>

397
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,160
there's a many different ways of getting

398
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,919
there but I think 100 years down the

399
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,980
road to do what we do is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

400
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:52,200
profession and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan for how</font>

401
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:52,200
we do that as a community yes

402
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:33,340
right right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be behind yeah</font>

403
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I agree with you you know people without</font>

404
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,970
degrees will be behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve in some</font>

405
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,250
way I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take this way down the</font>

406
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,250
rabbit hole mark Rogers who's speaking

407
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,470
of in digital forensics part once said

408
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,240
let's compare education versus training

409
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,790
is the following would you rather have

410
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:09,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">your child have sex education or sex</font>

411
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:11,510
training I mean if you really want to

412
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,590
learn it you went to training right but

413
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,580
you shouldn't you have the education

414
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,959
before you have the training most i

415
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,460
might even going down there but you

416
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:31,450
understand what I'm the point I'm trying

417
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:31,450
to make oh yeah i'm i'm learning

418
00:22:43,600 --> 00:23:34,520
yep but they have an artifact to use the

419
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:36,320
higher education<font color="#CCCCCC"> word yeah yeah I mean</font>

420
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">are people of postgraduate degrees in</font>

421
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,700
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> at McDonald's so I I think the</font>

422
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,750
poor by it and also I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brent</font>

423
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,400
blended approaches in is necessary where

424
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,790
you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of education and</font>

425
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,110
you know I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to education from</font>

426
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,290
industry so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different</font>

427
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,209
than somebody who has a PhD and

428
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">curriculum development so I try to spend</font>

429
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,940
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time to teach the Center for</font>

430
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,330
Teaching learning because they know

431
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,910
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't the being blended</font>

432
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:11,720
means that you're you're mixing it up so

433
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,120
that your students<font color="#E5E5E5"> are getting the best</font>

434
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,160
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> worlds and yes you can do</font>

00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:28,730
you think that it's easy yeah yeah it's

439
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,139
easy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's self-directed right so</font>

440
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,500
it's self directed some people thrive

441
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,950
some people don't so blended approach is

442
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that we we go I think in our</font>

443
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:43,250
industry we're all about the spectacle

444
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:45,649
Def Con is about the spectacle<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

repel from the hotel I mean

448
00:24:51,740 --> 00:25:02,030
now part of being a huh yeah whine about

449
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:04,370
hacker jeopardy the by making yourself

450

rappelling from the hotel and I guess

453
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:14,389
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of being in this community</font>

454

we have jobs so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say that</font>

457
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,010
hackers are like motorcycle clubs you've

472
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,600
this talk is is that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:45,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we look to other people to be</font>

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weird timing but I do</font>

489
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,140
you think that they'll ever blend I

490
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,899
think that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate we could</font>

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,680
this is wishful thinking this is like a

493
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,950
talk where I come up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say we</font>

ourselves apart because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

499
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,300
conflicts and I think that we're better

delight for students and basically what

512
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,520
to do is trying to use their design for

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,440
delight<font color="#CCCCCC"> framework which they use for new</font>

company to try to fix some of the

516
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,379
problems in West Virginia and how were

517
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,170
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> all dressed when they showed up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">way overdressed to interact with these</font>

520
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,040
people because they were wearing what

521
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,770
they wore to work in California which

522
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,129
was way less dressy than what I wear

523
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:30,340
even to teach so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean its culture is</font>

524
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,980
going to be different I just think that

525
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,919
we need to not let cultural differences

526
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,680
in the community separate us just

527
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,630

580
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,730
saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> come you know I hanging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on IRC</font>

581
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,470
channels while people still do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

582
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:18,490

583
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:20,390
unlikely pack so I mean ok let's look at

584
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">slac a slack</font>

585
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:26,090
if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> invited to one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more slack</font>

586
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,860
channel i'm going to get ballistic let's

587
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,770
look at doctors doctors used to hang

588
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,209
around graveyards so that they could you

589
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,530
know pill for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> grave so they could</font>

590
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at bones right don't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

591
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:45,830
why because they're professionals as my

592
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:48,350
analogies work you know doctors used to

593
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,210
be barbers used to be doctors<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

594
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,480
used to bleed people put leeches on them

595
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,100
and they either got better they died and

596
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,200
the way you became a doctor is you

597
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,730
follow around another doctor and blood

598
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,300
people put leeches on them until they

599
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,950
got better they died we're the phase and

600
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,419
information security<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going</font>

601
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,550
around bleeding people and putting

602
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,450
leeches on them and see if they survive

603
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:13,880
or die this community will change the

604
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,439
technologies change I think AI is going

605
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,970
to play a big part of this as we move

606
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,710
forward and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a different</font>

607
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,589
world we need to think about what the

608
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,940
world looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when we get there</font>
