26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:28,130
talk is about ransomware we got hit at

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:31,409
work twice and on the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> day of</font>

seminary school my professor said the

29
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,960
key to a good sermon is you have a good

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,700
opening and a good closing and you don't

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,009
make a very far apart so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you guys the secret to surviving</font>

33
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,180
grant somewhere right at the beginning

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,649
and then we'll go through a little bit

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,119
about what read somewhere is and how it

36
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,799
goes but the secret to surviving

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,450
ransomware is real simple backups got to

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,670
have good backups and we'll talk about

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,799
that and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret to having good</font>

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:10,038
backups is this not those guys but keep

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,039
it simple keep it really simple

42
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,739
pick whatever kind of backup you want to

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,650
do tape backups off-site backups cloud

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,080
backups doesn't matter but you have to

45
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,300
do them you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,680
hit home to me back when I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

47
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:32,310
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Sheriff's Department and we had a</font>

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,810
reel-to-reel tape backup and man<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

49
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,560
thing was it was it was ridiculously

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,890
hard to use and I made a mistake of

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,670
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> Testament so consequently we had a</font>

52
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:51,119
date we had a hardware failure and had a

53
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:53,459
big problem this surveying company did a

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,260
survey of IT professionals over 300

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,790
organizations and found and nearly a

56
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,399
hundred percent reported that they were

57
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,220
actively backing up their data and out

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,660
of those that had not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet experienced a</font>

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,460
ransomware attack eighty-one percent

60

said they were confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would</font>

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover any of the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

62
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,590
the attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> our cryptid encrypted</font>

63
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,810
without paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ransom however as you</font>

64
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see from the bottom of the</font>

65
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,920
professionals that had that had been hit

66
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,050
by a ransomware attack only<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty two</font>

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,899
percent were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> successfully</font>

68
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,390
recover their data and the main reason

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that was because of unmonitored and</font>

70
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,109
failed backups matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fact that the</font>

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,590
reason I have the job that I have now is

72
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,990
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a failed back up the at the</font>

73
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,580
law firm their server crashed and they

74
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,830
went to restore from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup and it</font>

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,330
was it was empty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they called me to</font>

76
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">help them recover their data and that's</font>

77
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,410
how I ended up getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job there so</font>

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,350
the more all of the story with backups

79
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,609
is you test test and test if you've got

80
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,530
to back up and you haven't ever restored

81
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,180
from it then it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a backup</font>

82
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,580
this is how i do my backups is real

83
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,230
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote this little batch</font>

84
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,480
file that runs on my computer at night

85
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,739
at eight o'clock and it copies

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,019
everything to one of the network access

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,890
storage devices and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

88
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:21,380
incremental backup we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

89
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,380
later in at the end

90
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,370
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've told you the secret to</font>

91
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,960
surviving ransomware let's talk a little

92
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit all this is this is the screen that</font>

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,409
pops up on my computer every morning

94
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,969
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> come into work and I check it</font>

95
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,190
every day just to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

96
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,690
worked great so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ransomware read</font>

97
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,430
somewhere is the type of malware that

98
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,640
affects computer systems restricts

99
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,250
access to the infected systems there are

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of variants going around and it's</font>

101
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,670
evolved over time but most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

102
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:59,840
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money to get your stuff</font>

103
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:02,640
unencrypted how does ransomware work

104
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,380
well there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several methods that you</font>

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,909
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get infected you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can most popular of</font>

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:11,700
course email attachments<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font>

107
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,710
infected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of going to the wrong</font>

108
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,530
website and having malicious code

109
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,340
downloaded to your system you can get

110
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,840
infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a bad USB Drive or you can</font>

111
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:29,099
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get infected through an instant</font>

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:31,349
messenger file or link and here's a each

113
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,490
ransomware variant is engineered to

114
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,220
operate a little differently however

115
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,220
common traits include fairly complex

116
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,130
stealth techniques and covert launch

117
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,710
mechanisms meant to avoid early

118
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,190
antivirus detection including obscure

119
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">file names modifying file attributes and</font>

120
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,900
operating under the pretense of

121
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,720
legitimate programs and services and as

122
00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:00,750
an example cryptolocker which is one of

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more widespread ransom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wears it gets</font>

124
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:07,380
installed by a zbot variant and that's a

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan an email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan and after</font>

126
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,000
execution is edge itself to start up

127
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,030
under a random file name and tries to

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the its own command and</font>

129
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,239
control server and if it can then it

130
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,840
gets a<font color="#E5E5E5"> public key and a Bitcoin address</font>

131
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,670
and then it encrypts<font color="#CCCCCC"> the files on your</font>

132
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,940
computer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does over 70 different</font>

133
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:34,970
file types so why does<font color="#CCCCCC"> ransomware work</font>

134
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,199
well the main reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

135
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,870
because you clicked it not many people

136
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know Boris but he's famous for</font>

137
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,310
saying don't click stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

138
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">main reason ransomware works is because</font>

139
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,410
people clicked it the second reason is

140
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,970
because most people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a disaster</font>

141
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">recovery wood frame like this and then</font>

142
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,599
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason of course why it works</font>

143
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,729
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just don't have good</font>

144
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:05,520
backups so where does ransomware come

145
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,219
from there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a couple of stories in</font>

146
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,020
the news the Dutch police busted a

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,139
couple of kids who were running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

148
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:20,639
ransomware scam here's an article about

149
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:22,740
ransomware scam people from China but at

150
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolled bills</font>

151
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:30,500
attribution dice and you just come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

152
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,500
with wherever ransomware could be from

153
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,448
why can't anyone stop it well just like

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Smokey the Bear says the only real way</font>

155
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,820
to stop ransomware is you have to stop

156
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">it yourself nobody's going to do it for</font>

157
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,630
you nobody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect you the</font>

158
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,520
government can't protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that matter</font>

159
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,360
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> air bases we blow up in Syria</font>

160
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,099
they're still going to be ransomware and

161
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,699
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is read somewhere works</font>

162
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,889
and it's so popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> because people say</font>

163
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know back in the old days when email</font>

164
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,940
first started and everybody got

165
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,460
thousands of male enhancement emails in

166
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,630
their junk mail box every day the reason

167
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,818
people were sending us out is because

168
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,400
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> someplace was bottom they</font>

169
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,259
weren't just doing it for fun and that's

170
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,030
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deal is was ransomware people</font>

171
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,949
are paying so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep</font>

172
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">paying there's going to keep being</font>

173
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:28,430
ransomware so here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first attack</font>

174
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:31,650
that I was hit with it was Christmastime

175
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:35,419
2015 and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course all the supervisors</font>

176
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:37,828
in the office were on vacation and I

177
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,279
came into<font color="#E5E5E5"> work one morning and I'll</font>

178
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:45,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">check my backup screen us all that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huh</font>

179
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:48,120
that's not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I go walking around</font>

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,760
the office and I find

181
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,240
a computer at this lady's desk that had

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,910
that screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was telling me</font>

183
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,610
what I needed to do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my data back</font>

184
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,250
now I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking around on my file</font>

185
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,430
server and fortunately this version of

186
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,520
crypto<font color="#CCCCCC"> where only attacked drives that</font>

187
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,829
were mapped on her computer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> she could</font>

188
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,050
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main server drive and she could</font>

189
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,850
see the drive for our document back at

190
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,099
our document management system was and

191
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,320
in her c drive that was it and

192
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,290
interestingly enough this version of

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,320
ransomware had an error in its code

194
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,589
because it crashed out at the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

195
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,860
gigabyte file limit so it only encrypted

196
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first two gigabytes of my server</font>

197
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,290
fortunately for me so what the

198
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,300
aggravating thing about this resin where

199
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:44,040
attack was this was this was on her

200
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,099
computer and it had been on there since

201
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day before and I asked her about it</font>

202
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I said did you see that right and</font>

203
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">she's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I was like well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah why</font>

204
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,100
didn't you call me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

205
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just opened an email and that</font>

206
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,760
popped up and i didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what to do</font>

207
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,680
it newest to say she didn't work there

208
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,750
anymore so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how I fixed it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

209
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:15,329
first called my friend bill that was his

210
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,400
reaction but then I deleted all the

211
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,880
encrypted stuff and i restored it from

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,529
the back up that was it I took<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

213
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,089
machine out of service<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't even</font>

214
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,070
didn't even attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean it i just</font>

215
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew too wiped out the hard drive</font>

216
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">started over on hers now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

217
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:36,270
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had was in the summer well it</font>

218
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,000
was in last summer I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about to go to</font>

219
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:42,600
lunch and I have an incremental backup

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,310
that runs during the day and it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

221
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,430
little window on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen and I can</font>

222
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of watch as the files go by and all</font>

223
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,449
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden this stuff started popping</font>

224
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:57,510
up and I thought oh that's not good so

225
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,130
jump up from my desk run around to the

226
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,819
computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the office and sure enough</font>

227
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,500
I find one with that on it an interest

228
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,970
this situation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

229
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,490
because as I walk into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room the</font>

230
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,750
secretary looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me and she says I'm</font>

231
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,000
glad you here I was about to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I</font>

232
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,490
tried to open an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with the</font>

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,339
picture in it and didn't work and I was

234
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,890
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting ready to call you I said</font>

235
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,390
okay well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then as I was yanking her</font>

236
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,740
computer out of the wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and carrying it</font>

237
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,959
back down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my office I said okay</font>

238
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,370
thanks so this version of ransomware

239
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">septa worked a little differently and</font>

240
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,260
that it ignored what drives she was

241
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,150
mapped to and it just went out and

242
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:46,980
scanned the network and it started at

243
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:49,380
what would have been the lowest drive so

244
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,640
like my z drive and it started

245
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,860
encrypting there which oddly enough was

246
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,959
my backup<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive so the main server was</font>

247
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,690
fine but it encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backup and so</font>

248
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,540
I really didn't suffer any loss in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

249
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:11,070
because I just deleted the back up and

250
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:14,370
made a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so let's talk about</font>

251
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:17,100
building a defense against ransomware

252
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,230
which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been going on</font>

253
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,180
at work for the last 18 months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

254
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">a it's a progressive thing and after</font>

255
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,829
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> every attack of course I had to</font>

256
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:29,040
change and get better but the first

257
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:32,520
thing to know about building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a defense</font>

258
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,110
is it has to be in layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

259
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,939
onions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ogres it has to be in layers</font>

260
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,589
the most important thing and the first

261
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,680
line of defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always training and</font>

262
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,540
education you know the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> lady and</font>

263
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,979
the end the that I told the story about

264
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,370
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first attacks she didn't speak</font>

265
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,470
up I all know Washington call me but

266
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,209
that was the main problem I had with her

267
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,589
now the second lady she was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

268
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,900
call me and I believed her when she<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

269
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because it was lunchtime and was</font>

270
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,120
right the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lunch and she</font>

271
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,199
said she was going to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> me after</font>

272
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,089
lunch so I've made a big deal about now

273
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:08,910
you know soon as you see something I

274
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,860
would rather get filled 10 calls a day

275
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,709
from people asking me if this email is

276
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to open that I would spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font>

277
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,369
of time fix

278
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,599
one of these the second thing is report

279
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,670
something if you do click on something

280
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,710
that everybody clicks on something that

281
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,599
shouldn't at some point in time I have

282
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,920
everybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room has at some point</font>

283
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,870
time you click on something and after

284
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,810
you click on it you thought I shouldn't

285
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that well the key is you have</font>

286
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,649
to tell and this is the screen that

287
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,410
people get I've started using a piece of

288
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,480
software called hitman pro and I've got

289
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,860
all my staff now trained us is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

now how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell if an email is</font>

292
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,510
dangerous and that's the this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

293
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,980
first obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first big part of</font>

294
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,040
the education that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to go</font>

295
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,080
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> with everybody so here's a few</font>

296
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,550
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

297
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,930
hard to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a feeling but the the</font>

298
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,479
the main thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing I look</font>

299
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,489
at is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL but you know the thing</font>

300
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,350
about this email is striking to me and

301
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,880

303
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,120
and I don't know why somebody would

304
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,760
click on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the first thing</font>

305
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,010
you have to ask yourself is well did you

306
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,900

309
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,560
office so this is a guy who'd been to

310
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,750
law school been a law clerk for a

representing you or someone in your

313
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,230

00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:02,520
let me ask you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question did you buy</font>

322
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:14,279
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said you didn't really win</font>

323
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,860

324
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,500

325
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,589
had and he got a virus on his computer

326
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:26,190
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing you have to</font>

327
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:30,060
you have to beat into your users heads

328
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,430
is the email legitimate the other thing

329
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,520
I teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> my you know you teach everybody</font>

330
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,709
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the spelling look at the grammar</font>

331
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,860
hover over the links in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email and</font>

332
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,880
see if they match who the emails coming

333
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,370
from is it something you were expecting

334
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:52,200
here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example you know the</font>

335
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">email the subject line is bad and you</font>

336
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,660
know the attachment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a dot zip I</font>

337
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,940
just quit except in God zips at work I

338
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,949
we just we just quit taking them if

339
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,860
another law firm says it's something and

340
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,720
it's as if I I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they have to</font>

341
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:12,060
drop box that are sending some other way

342
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,680
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't think of this is a good</font>

343
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,000
one everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets these fake shipping</font>

344
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,329
emails and you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,310
expecting a package then you know don't

346
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:25,230
even bother looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it you know it</font>

347
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,060
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email sent to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font>

348
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,820
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at an email and there's</font>

a 37 addresses and who is going to and

350
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:38,910
you don't know any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them then you know</font>

351
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,290
that's obviously fake and you know

352
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,800
there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's from Germany I mean</font>

353
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,360
do you even know anybody in Germany it's

354
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,740
just obvious things that you but you

355
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,420
really have to beat these into your

356
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,480
users heads over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

357
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,400
this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this is one of</font>

358
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,720
our emails this one's very close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

359
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,050
one that was the cause the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first attack</font>

360
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,790
it's a zip and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an invoice to</font>

361
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,889
what got me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is look at</font>

362
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,069
the country code in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> emailed I'm not</font>

363
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,240
sure where<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it's Estonia you</font>

364
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,740
know why would we be getting an email

365
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,470
from there to begin with why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font>

366
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,990
even be open in that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then this one</font>

367
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,120
was very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second one now</font>

368
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,599
what this the lady<font color="#E5E5E5"> who got hit with the</font>

369
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:24,089
second attack hurry the email that got

370
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,310
her was very clever because and it was

371
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:32,159
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of lucky because we had a</font>

372
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:33,750
client his name was Rita and the and it

373
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,370
was this lady's caught a case she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

374
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,429
working on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was expecting her to</font>

375
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,928
send some pictures oddly enough and so

376
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">she got an email this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is nothing</font>

377
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:44,269
exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same one but she got an email that</font>

378
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:47,340
said Rita at and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just had a</font>

379
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:49,289
generic email address and it said it was

380
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,480
a Jeff now it was a jiff<font color="#E5E5E5"> top zip like</font>

381
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:54,210
this but it was a Jeff and so she

382
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

383
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">perfect storm that she got caught up in</font>

384
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,269
now so I started investigating after

385
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,389
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started investigating some</font>

386
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:15,570
other solutions to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help this and</font>

387
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:17,129
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop first thing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can look at</font>

388
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,289
is you know call your call your email

389
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:24,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendor and see if they have a spam</font>

390
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:27,330
filtering virus filtering at the source

391
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:31,049
you know whoever your host is they can

392
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,970
filter out some of this stuff the next

393
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,220
thing and this happened this is handy

394
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:40,619
for a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than</font>

395
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:42,450
ransomware especially spam stuff I had a

396
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,600
buddy of mine in Oklahoma City they got

397
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,899
email bombed I mean he was getting five

398
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">or six thousand emails a day because he</font>

399
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:54,178
had been somebody had subscribed him to

400
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,100
all these listservs and he couldn't get

401
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of them I mean he was trying</font>

402
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,129
to do it it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be they were coming</font>

403
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,519
faster than he could deal with so I

404
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:03,658
helped him implement whitelisting and

405
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,460
there's some interesting whitelisting

406
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:07,080
solutions out there basically it's you

407
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,169
only get emails from people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

408
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,820
allow to get emails from now you know in

409
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:16,289
some businesses you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do</font>

410
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:19,799
that but it helped help them and it's

411
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:22,379
it's good practice hardware solutions

412
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,269
you know everybody needs a firewall to

413
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:27,539
keep the devil<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the death and the</font>

414
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:30,330
fiery skulls out you know when everybody

415
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:33,720
likes a good blinky light box some

416
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:36,360
firewalls can can do content filtering

417
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,159
email content filtering they tend to be

418
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,748
slow and they tend to be expensive there

419
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,369
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good software solutions that</font>

420
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:47,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> install on everybody's desktop I</font>

421
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:49,678
really like hitman pro it was cheap for

422
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:51,520
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> office like 600 bucks for 30</font>

423
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,210
installs

424
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:59,080
and for three years and it runs really

425
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:02,080
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones malwarebytes it's</font>

426
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:06,129
similar to hitman pro but you know I

427
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,860
called them about a about a solution for

428
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,480
my office and I said I needed 30

429
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,490
licenses and they said I we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

430
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,720
we could do one that small so they were

431
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:20,110
they were for obviously for much bigger

432
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:23,440
much bigger organizations another

433
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:27,850
important thing to do is check your

434
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,800
security settings on your on everybody's

435
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:34,090
computer and this is something I'm in

436
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,520
the middle of right now is you know this

437
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a concept of the least privilege so</font>

438
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,129
have everybody security settings set

439
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,840
everything to know and then only turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

440
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that they gripe about not</font>

441
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,879
being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that's kind of that's</font>

442
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,130
kind of the policy implementing right

443
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,780
now and then the newest one I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

444
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,310

be worthless anyway the last thing I'm

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the next thing I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

497
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to briefly mention is you know</font>

498
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:31,939
what is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin and I never recommend</font>

499
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,260
paying for any of these but and I'm not

500
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into how to get a Bitcoin</font>

501
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,440
and how all that works but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

502
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:37,730
just go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin calm and you can</font>

503
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,049
start reading about it we were kind of

504
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,649
having to discussion out in the hallway

505
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:44,809
a minute ago about bitcoins and the

506
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:46,100
wallet that you have to get and all the

507
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,279
personal information that you have to

508
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,559
put in there but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good idea</font>

509
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,299
to at least familiarize yourself with it

510
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:59,389
until you're having to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in an</font>

511
00:23:53,299 --> 00:24:01,279
emergency situation so oh man you got

512
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,720
hit what do you do now because sooner or

513
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,760
later everybody is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get hit</font>

514
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,260
whether you want to or not where you

515
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,850
want to be or not no matter how careful

516
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,520
you are no matter how prepared you think

517
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,610
you are so the first thing is how do you

518
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:18,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you got hit well I know because I</font>

519
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:22,010
check my backups and my data every day

520
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,410
a couple times<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I view this screen</font>

521
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,820
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning every time when I come in</font>

522
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again at least</font>

523
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,429
once a day just to make sure there's

524
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,260
nothing that looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other</font>

525
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,210
thing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do is you got</font>

526
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,530
to find the entry point and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

527
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:41,150
got hit somewhere on your network there

528
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,830
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a pc that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has this on the</font>

529
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,230
desktop and the first thing he's always

530
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,360
encrypt is the stuff that's on the

531
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:50,260
desktop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C Drive and then</font>

532
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,469
they jump out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there so they'll be a</font>

533
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,820
desktop someplace that has that on it

534
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,710
now you know if you can remote login to

535
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,080
all your desktops that makes it easy I

536
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,060
have to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and run around check with</font>

537
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,740
everybody and look at them all but

538
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:08,990
you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the next thing to do is</font>

539
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,810
to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infection from spreading an</font>

540
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:17,020
easiest way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is this just yank</font>

541
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arella wall that's what I did both times</font>

542
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:25,040
then you have to start looking to see

543
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,460
how bad it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was get on your server start</font>

544
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,620
doing some searching you know all these

545
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,660
tend to have the same like zip code

546
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,209
names all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> files dots up those so you</font>

547
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,570
can just do a search and see where all

548
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,940
it went and then they all have a little

549
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:44,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTML file at that they put in every</font>

550
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:47,810
folder that has that instruction screen

551
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:52,250
you can search for that and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

552
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:54,580
it is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then this is something Jason</font>

573
00:26:53,839 --> 00:27:22,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was on the syllabus anybody else</font>

574
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:24,829
yes it will well the gamble in that is

575
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:27,589
I'm assuming that it's not going to it's

576
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:29,839
not going to encrypt my device see it

577
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:31,908
because if I don't trigger the

578
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:37,940
ransomware then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to</font>

579
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:39,739
my pc you see what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying because</font>

580
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,489
see my drive is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared on the</font>

581
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:45,379
network so unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trip the ransomware</font>

582
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:48,919
it's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the local device</font>

583
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:52,879
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my pc now if I screw up</font>

584
00:27:48,919 --> 00:28:19,690
in trip to ransomware then you're right

585
00:27:52,879 --> 00:28:19,689
yeah go ahead right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> II</font>

586
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,230
[Laughter]

587
00:28:46,020 --> 00:29:14,559
right right well and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my case in both</font>

588
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,270
instances of my case it did ignore that

589
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,250
because my document management system

590
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:21,040
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own backup like you're talking</font>

591
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and it doesn't back up into a zip</font>

592
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,428
it has its own esteem because it the

593
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,220
name of the program is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom</font>

594
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:30,100
matters and it backs up into a dot TM

595
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:34,870
well read both versions of ransomware

596
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:37,240
that TDM wasn't on its list so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

597
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:40,449
instances my document management system

598
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,970
and its backups were untouched because

599
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:46,630
the extensions were not on its list that

600
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,610
it looks at but yeah the ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

601
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,350
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the same as the ones that</font>

602
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,100
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about you know I I lost</font>

603
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:57,149
all my<font color="#E5E5E5"> docs I lost all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my excels I lost</font>

604
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,110
all my powerpoints I lost all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my pdfs</font>

605
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,340
you know those are the main ones that

606
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,459
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look for anyway now</font>

607
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,139
that the interestingly enough we did

608
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,730
have some you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I have some very very</font>

609
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:13,090
old data that was WordPerfect data from

610
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:14,980
I mean from years ago legacy stuff from

611
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:18,220
very old cases that we keep just for

612
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:21,490
reference and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get those this is</font>

613
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,650
too old so yeah you know that's a valid

614
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:27,250
point you know if you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you have</font>

615
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:29,500
a backup archive system that you can

616
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:33,130
kind of hide in plain view if you're an

617
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,220
extension that's not on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list yeah go</font>

618
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:51,960
ahead

619

branson area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my state so you may</font>

620
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,750
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infection but it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

621
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,429
act it won't start encrypting because it

622
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:09,120
can't go back to the command control

623
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:22,710
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right right because it can't</font>

624
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:36,780
get the key ya know what's good that's

625
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:42,450
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> true right right yeah that's a</font>
