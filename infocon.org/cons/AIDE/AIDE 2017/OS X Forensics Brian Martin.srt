00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,400
Martin welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mack forensics 101 how</font>

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,770
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have worked with Mac</font>

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,140
forensics get anybody experienced<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,109
forensics people you know good then we

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't be bored in this because it's not</font>

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,010
an advanced course it's a basics if

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,348
you've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac forensics we're</font>

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,230
going to cover like all of the stuff but

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,290
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any great detail some of it we</font>

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,500
will some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what we want but the reason</font>

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,370
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about Mac forensics is</font>

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,120
because they're becoming much more

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,218
common ten years ago I don't think i

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,038
ever saw a mac in a forensics case

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,829
people had them they were there but we'd

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">never see them and now they're coming up</font>

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,890
almost every time at least it's at least

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">5050 and because we deal with large</font>

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,010
cases with multiple computers we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

21
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:08,729
see a mac in there every time now don't

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:14,939
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep on me sorry not to be</font>

23
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:16,259
careful time that since we're seeing

24
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,258
more of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

25
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,240
you guys were getting kind of awareness

26
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,299
of it in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> coursework or in the</font>

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,669
conference here because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:31,500
come across it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Who am I and why is it</font>

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">even worth your time to be here well I'm</font>

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,650
a forensics guy I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing this for</font>

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,539
like 35 years now started in the Air

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">Force thank you your tax dollars finance</font>

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,990
my education well not yours with your

34
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:48,929
parents we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 400 cases we</font>

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,548
have I don't know how many lockers full

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,850
of evidence for different clients and so

37
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,409
on we do have the best internship

38
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,329
program in the world I will pitch that

39
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,530
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though nobody from down</font>

40
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,490
here ever takes me up on it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

41
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,680
have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to Allentown</font>

42
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,399
Pennsylvania for it but at least it's

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,869
fun and what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what we're</font>

44
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,090
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today will get you</font>

45
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,370
more up to speed on OS X so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,690
don't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a cold the first time we</font>

47
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,530
had to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mac i was like well</font>

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,170
i use a mac

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,770
how hard can it be and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I dug into</font>

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I'm like this is hard but it's really</font>

51
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,060
not that hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's even easier now</font>

52
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:29,399
than it used to be or os tennis bill

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:31,020
says I can't read the slides from here

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,950
though this is a disclaimer slide of

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,110
course you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a disclaimer</font>

56
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:39,959
right I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lawyer I'm not a perfect</font>

57
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,100
yes I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect definitely not as</font>

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,580
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I can't read the</font>

59
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,810
screen from here but the most important

60
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing here is that anything we talked</font>

61
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,220
about in the presentation you can't have

62
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun you can't just run off and do stuff</font>

63
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,650
right you can't learn a little bit about

64
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:03,510
this and then go do forensics in the

65
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:05,010
real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be a bad thing so</font>

66
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,569
the first thing you have to do of course

67
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,920
is get training which is a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

68
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">why you're here right is to learn</font>

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">something new when it comes to the tools</font>

70
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:20,640
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is training available</font>

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,920
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> entry-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forensics people or</font>

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,589
people who get into forensics will by

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,869
accident for example they work in a box

74
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,190
shop building servers for clients and

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,590
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> something happens and they're like</font>

76
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,359
can you do forensics and like yes I can

77
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,470
and they go to youtube and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then watch a</font>

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,000
video and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can do</font>

79
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,640
forensics and the end up making

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,799
everybody's life miserable so get real

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,670
training real training typically costs

82
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,519
money so don't just want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

83
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">company to pay for training when you go</font>

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,870
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work in the real world training</font>

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,399
costs different amounts depending on

86
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,079
what it is you're training for there's a

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,730
certain software package that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

88
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,140
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's used heavily by</font>

89
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,179
government and law enforcement and

90
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,190
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very proud of their software</font>

91
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,230
it's very expensive the training is

92
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,420
expensive I don't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

93
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,858
it's necessary there are better tools

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:14,010
for the job especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes to</font>

95
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:17,789
max most notably<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here on the screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

96
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways which works with everything do you</font>

97
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:25,700
guys cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> X ways in any of your course</font>

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,700
work no bill um TJ's<font color="#E5E5E5"> place come on man</font>

99
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">x ways is the cat's meow it's one of the</font>

100
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,450
most powerful tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to use</font>

101
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,090
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also one of the most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

102
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,849
to learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use properly it's also</font>

103
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,599
fortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cheapest one to learn</font>

104
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to use properly so get xrays if</font>

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,840
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do forensics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn how</font>

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,370
to use it you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually afford to do</font>

107
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,929
that on your own it's not like the other

108
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,120
ones where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to cough up 5 grand</font>

109
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,350
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a training session the</font>

110
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:02,010
other one that I like is black bag black

111
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,590
light for max they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac stuff so they</font>

112
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,300
know max really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and it also does</font>

113
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,729
windows stuff and ironically it runs on

114
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,260
windows while it's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac stuff or</font>

115
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,850
runs on macs while it's doing windows

116
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,090
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really slick the way they've</font>

117
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,300
done that and it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it's</font>

118
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:21,000
fairly intuitive and they have the best

119
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,190
Timeline feature out of anything which

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,500
is why one of the reasons I like it we

121
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:33,230
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> view yeah we talked about why</font>

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,010
I'm doing this but there's a funny slide

123
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:41,910
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get us to our</font>

124
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:43,289
first story the reason we're talking

125
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,810
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> people not doing things right and</font>

126
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,130
getting education and so on is we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

127
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,610
call the other day from a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine</font>

128
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,169
a business<font color="#CCCCCC"> associate who is desperate</font>

129
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,620
for help he's like can you image<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mac</font>

130
00:05:52,169 --> 00:06:00,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like if you don't know how to</font>

131
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,910
image a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac that may be a difficult</font>

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,820
question but max have imaging built into

133
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,880
them so it's really not hard it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,290
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's there so it calls me</font>

135
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
up in the answer if we can image and I'm

136
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:17,960
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah sure no problem we can do that</font>

137
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,419
send it over so he sends us this mac and

138
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,979
it's not powered on we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

139
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,919

finding the steps

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,289
so we'd image the laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then he</font>

148
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:49,800
starts asking us questions about it to

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:52,680
do our<font color="#E5E5E5"> forensics investigation and we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">right and I'm so I a man who did stuff</font>

to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac he's like what we had an FBI</font>

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,440
an image<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mac and like I said that's</font>

had it before us for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple weeks and</font>

161
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:38,430
we get it but he couldn't manage it

162
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:42,330
which I thought was hysterical<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

163
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,650
it gets interesting so when he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

164
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he couldn't figure out how to image</font>

evidence anybody yes don't modify

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them because we work in forensics</font>

175
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,130
we don't make these dumb mistakes but

176
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,810
this guy had screwed up the evidence and

177
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm like no big deal how bad can it be</font>

178

he<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned it on we're looking at weird</font>

179
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,820
dates and stuff so we dig into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

180
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,200
forensics case and I go looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

181
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,880
logs this is logs which are really

182
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,338
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's doing what went on</font>

183
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,950
the system and the problem when you turn

184
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,140
on a Mac is that if a certain amount of

185
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,380
time has passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will automatically</font>

186
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,240
rotate the system logs which meant in

187
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular case that all of the</font>

188
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,150
system logs for gone and that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

189
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,100
like key to any Mac investigation

190
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,170
having those system logs and they had

191
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:03,240
rotated off because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had turned on the</font>

192
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:06,270
machine which really ruined the case do

193
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,760
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mac and use the mac if</font>

194
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,010
you get a mac image to drive prior to

195
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">turning it on always work from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a copy</font>

196
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,830
this is like redundant stuff that you

197
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,050
shouldn't have to tell any forensic

198
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,660
investigator but just make sure you know

199
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,900
what you're doing with this stuff we

200
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't pull an FBI because when he did</font>

201
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,459
that and ruin the case it meant that

202
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,050
everything we did all of the work that

203
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had put into it was basically out the</font>

204
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,540
window because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we couldn't guarantee</font>

205
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,710
anything on the drive but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

206
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,030
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to put together some other</font>

207
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,520
stuff so it all worked out in the end

208
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:45,870
but it was bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the client and bad</font>

209
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:49,050
for the perp look good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perp the</font>

210
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,960
other problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have with OS X</font>

211
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,099
Files is the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it handles deleted</font>

212
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,850
files on disk and the way that it

213
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,130
handles<font color="#E5E5E5"> reused disk space unlike windows</font>

214
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,740
which traditionally lays down files in a

215
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,420
stream across the disk surface so that

216
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,400
it doesn't overwrite them which is

217
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,719
wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us because then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go</font>

218
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,850
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a window system and go look at all</font>

219
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,700
this data we've got all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

220
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,140
slack space Mac doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that UNIX</font>

221
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,120
doesn't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do that</font>

222
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,000
once they free up disk space it's free

223
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,770
to use and the algorithms are always

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,160
going to use it in front to back it's

225
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,840
not going to wait and then deallocate it

226
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,620
and work beyond it it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

227
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,630
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that spot so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you tend</font>

228
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more turn with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX</font>

229
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux systems then you do with the</font>

230
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,730
windows systems which is another reason

231
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:41,700
why it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your hands on</font>

232
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:43,200
quick and not alter them some fun stuff

233
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,000
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new file system on Apple</font>

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:51,270
because this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">important coming from going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward it</font>

236
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,770
has a feature called copy-on-write which

237
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,740
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's no straight copies of</font>

238
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,260
the files laying around so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

239
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,650
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> image file of a hockey game and</font>

240
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,130
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same file the new OS is only</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

spot<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disk very important if we</font>

244
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,959
both if I remove my link to the file

245
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:20,130
yours is still there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine's gone</font>

246
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,210
there's not multiple copies it's just

247
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,010
one of those weird things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

248
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">in cases as you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a window system</font>

249
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,400
and there's five copies of the same file

250
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,370
you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell your friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with dk</font>

251
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,780
software just list the copies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

252
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:39,210
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see them all makes going through</font>

253
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:40,589
the case easier the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in it</font>

254
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,870
though is the multiple layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

255
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">encryption which is going to just ruin</font>

256
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:50,880
our days much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphones did you</font>

257
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:53,850
guys talk about iphones yeah when you

258
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,380
lose the keys it's gone which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

259
00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:00,210
for bad guys not so great for good guys

260
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,460
but the new file system has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

261
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,650
disk encryption has volume little

262
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,960
encryption and it has file encryption

263
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,670
and that's three different sets of keys

264
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,350
the users not aware of most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

265
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,030
they're only aware of the one key the

266
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,770
rest of it's handled internal in the OS

267
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:19,170
which means if you punch those keys out

268
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:21,660
it's gone very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad the other fun thing</font>

269
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,020
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is space sharing so if</font>

270
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,930
you have two volumes on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk for some</font>

271
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,189
reason normally would be one volume per

272
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,870
disk but there's nothing stopping you

273
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:36,180
for making to it doesn't pre-allocate

274
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:41,520
all of the space so if you have a 40 gig

275
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:44,819
disk and you build<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 gig volumes on</font>

276
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,400
it or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Julia geeks systems they're</font>

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:51,030
going to share the free space until its

278
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,790
allocated which means i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

279
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,060
file in my space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then delete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

280
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:59,640
that data will show up in your space

281
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,319
because it's shared space that's a

282
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,090
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> strange it's encrypted though so</font>

283
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,010
will it matter and only if they're not

284
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,300
encrypting their disks but it's just one

285
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:11,400
more wrinkle in the new system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

286
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to be aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of so approach</font>

287
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,540
each case you're working on with a very

288
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,650
clear set of where it is that you want

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to determine</font>

with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially on things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> max</font>

293
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,830
because they're complicated and

294
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,390
potentially multi-user is to not know

295
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,950
what it is you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at be sure you</font>

296
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,050
understand the client's goals in the

supposed to be about you need to explain

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,680
that to the lawyer that we're heading

different logs in different places

different application files and so on if

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,020
you don't define what your end goals are

312
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,880
for the case you're going to tend to

313
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,740
wander into areas and spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

areas that you don't need to which just

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">increases the cost for the client so</font>

316
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,620
when it actually comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the tools that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in our shop we think that more is</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little different everybody's</font>

326
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,510
expensive though but it does make the

327
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,860
cases go really fast because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

four different systems working on

already have OS tools as anybody here

335
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:20,370
been frustrated by file searching on a

00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:23,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">mac no not at all wow this up here is</font>

337
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,780
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shows what a</font>

power user is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

339
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,000
if you can use things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this in your</font>

searches this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you make the the</font>

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,540
Finder window do its work right as

342
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,240
opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing its work wrong there's</font>

343
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,110
about 2,000 different options that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

344
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,190
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill in there lots of them but we're</font>

345
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,810
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Finder window</font>

346
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:47,880
anyways because we're command-line

347
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:50,459
people the other resource that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

348
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,439
at your disposal is the community never

349
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,210
be afraid to ask questions and this is

350
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go I don't care how much</font>

351
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,730
experience you have you're going to come

352
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,830
across stuff that doesn't make sense

353
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:02,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know we have a great</font>

354
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:06,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">community everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helps each other out</font>

355
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,910
so don't be shy professional

356
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,099
certifications and so on are valuable

357
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,209
some are more valuable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> others some</font>

358
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,650
of them come<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their own communities</font>

359
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,980
for example sands<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a great online</font>

360
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:22,199
forum ACM any ACM members association of

361
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,730
computing machinery<font color="#CCCCCC"> now okay the ACM is</font>

362
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,980
another great man when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to college</font>

363
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,720
everybody in comp sci or in any sort of

364
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,890
technical field had to be in the ACM or

365
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,890
I Triple E anybody in I Triple E<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

366
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,180
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably going to want no you</font>

367
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to be computer science to use</font>

368
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,699
the resource you're slackin anyways the

369
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,829
ACM and I Triple E have their own

370
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,780
community communities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're great</font>

371
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:51,090
resources of information i use the ACM

372
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,350
phenomenal library phenomenal but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

373
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,120
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little bit behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the times</font>

374
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:58,410
because their academics so you have to

375
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:03,750
maintain other contacts through<font color="#CCCCCC"> linkedin</font>

376
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:05,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook what have you so the</font>

377
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,880
interesting parts of OSX are generally

378
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,409
broken down into a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> key areas but</font>

379
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,480
there's stuff scattered all throughout

380
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,590
you've got two main spaces that you're

381
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,130
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you've got the system</font>

382
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,510
spaces and you've got the user spaces

383
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,240
inside each of those they break down

384
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,420
further into application systems and the

385
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,010
log areas depending on what level you're

386
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,600
working at if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's installed at system</font>

387
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:32,400
level if it's work off the user stuff

388
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,169
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to malware that stuff can</font>

389
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,120
be hidden anywhere but if you're

390
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,170
investigating user activity most of what

391
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,168
you're after is going to be in user

392
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,639
space the only reason to

393
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,710
to the system space there as if you're

394
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:45,590
looking for stuff to<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirm what the</font>

395
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,659
hardware did like was the hardware in

396
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,488
this physical area with access to these

397
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:52,159
wireless networks was it plugged into

398
00:17:49,489 --> 00:18:01,369
this network that's system stuff not

399
00:17:52,159 --> 00:18:02,960
user stuff fun stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with images</font>

400
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:07,999
and icons on thumbnails can you read

401
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:13,730
that okay good because again I can't

402
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to come over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here one of the fun</font>

403
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,879
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple does is thumbnail</font>

404
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:20,418
everything you look at has anybody

405
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:23,119
messed with the icon database now this

406
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:26,989
comes up in certain cases where we deal

407
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:31,970
with a lot of images you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

408
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:35,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about CP but it also comes up in</font>

409
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,669
IP intellectual property cases did they

410
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:40,429
look at the PDF I never looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

411
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,649
PDF well you've got a image of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

412
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">your cash database so you must</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

413
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,258
looked at it because the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this</font>

414
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,460
gets populated is if you looked at

415
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:50,840
something so we spend a lot of time in

416
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">here when it has anything at all to do</font>

417
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,779
with images or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish</font>

422
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,969
view system files if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't done</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it let you poke around and do</font>

425
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:38,178
things from different areas without<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

432
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,250
stuff at the end because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flip</font>

433
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,779
the screen back and forth and it gets

434
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,539
really freaked out so we'll look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

435
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:11,240
that stuff at the end specific tools

445
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:40,489
and get specific tools I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't show</font>

446
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,990
up which we will when we go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

449
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:53,330
standalone utilities other interesting

450
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:59,299
bits with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Darwin user</font>

the date strings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS X and wondered</font>

454
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:11,690
what the heck was going on this is

455
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:19,279
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on it's from 11 2001 yay</font>

456
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:20,899
trivia and then I think this yeah most

457
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,039
of the good sequel tools I don't know

458
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:23,570
about all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them but at least</font>

459
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:27,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">blacklight will translate that for you</font>

automatically which is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> handy</font>

461
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:34,850
otherwise you have to do it yourself

462
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:38,539
through shell<font color="#E5E5E5"> script so when you</font>

463
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:41,389
approach a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac in a case we first on the</font>

464
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:43,039
scene with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing there's two things</font>

465
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:46,519
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of if it's</font>

466
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,129
running don't shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down so that you</font>

467
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,470
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the memory off of it if it's not</font>

468
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:53,689
running don't turn it on because you'll

469
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,800
clear up the file system that's really

470
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple there's a problem though</font>

471
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,240
the new max don't tell you if they're

472
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,180
running or shut down until you open it

473
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,730
up so when you open<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you have to have</font>

474
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:10,130
your hand ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit the magic</font>

475
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,960
sequence that keeps it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from booting to</font>

476
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,430
take you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recovery partition which</font>

477
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,470
if it's already running<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't do any</font>

478
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,940
harm so you can do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get away</font>

479
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:22,400
with it and just quick duck in there

480
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:24,650
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen comes up every time</font>

481
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,930
they change the OS there's new

482
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,220
information files get moved around it's

483
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,170
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a drag but it's perpetual</font>

484
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,120
employment so we don't think too badly

485
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,320
of them or Microsoft for the massive

486
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,919
changes that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> make from version to</font>

487
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,870
version because it keeps us all employed

488
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:43,580
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on a windows XP case right</font>

489
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:45,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and I had like totally forgotten how</font>

490
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,879
XP did anything and I'm in there

491
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,370
monkeying around in the GUI and I'm like

492
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,080
where is stuff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

493
00:22:49,370 --> 00:23:02,179
everything thanks lots of OSS so even

494
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:03,710
the new stuff gets to be old these are

495
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,960
the recent changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the macbook that</font>

496
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,370
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked about yes my favorite it</font>

497
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,550
will automatically start up when you

498
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:19,820
connect at the power bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac very bad no</font>

499
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,649
indicator often also good yes if you're

500
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:26,689
going to image one of the new macbooks

501
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:29,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that only has the USBC port you have to</font>

502
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,690
have a docking chain of dongles that is

503
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,130
hilarious you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

504
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,780
converts it to what you want you have to

505
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,920
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one to plug your disk into for</font>

506
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,389
making the image you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

507
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">another one to plug your imaging tool</font>

508
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:44,780
into unless using the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and then</font>

509
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to have power because that's</font>

510
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,160
where it gets its power and if any of

511
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,680
the devices in your chain need power

512
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,810
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have power too so it can</font>

513
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">get really strange with multiple power</font>

514
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,960
connectors and multiple dongles just to

515
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,380
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything set up so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can image</font>

516
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the silly thing in our shop we tend to</font>

517
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,790
just take it apart and pull the drive

518
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">out they will M to drive or whatever it</font>

519
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">is they're using a box is full of</font>

520
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,740
dongles because all of the manufacturers

521
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,960
of the micro laptops

522
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,250
different formats it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

523
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,179
pull out a hard drive anymore you're

524
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,920
pulling out chips and in some cases you

525
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:21,230
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're soldered on or</font>

526
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,000
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a permanent fixture and you</font>

527
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:36,140
can't get them off and then you back to

528
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:38,570
the USBC port the command line is one of

529
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,429
our more powerful tools because terminal

530
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,950
never lies unfortunately it's a

531
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:45,590
love-hate relationship it never lies but

532
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:51,590
it also has no memory or very little

533
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:53,600
memory it's quicker in some cases to use

534
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,919
the finder so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

535
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,809
monkeying about with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I hope</font>

536
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:11,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know command line because you're</font>

537
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:12,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other thing that</font>

538
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,090
you get from the command line like I

539
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,059
said is that there's no memory it

540
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,280
doesn't make fingernails so there's no

541
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,670
entries in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cache database from you</font>

542
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:26,540
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with files they're like</font>

543
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:28,880
firing off a viewer so if the bad guys

544
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,879
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart they would do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything from</font>

545
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the command line but they're not thank</font>

546
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:41,630
goodness one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

547
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,730

rotation missing a bash history bashes

user IDs that are kept in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Darwin if</font>

there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more user IDs in the Darwin</font>

554
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,220
has deleted users it gives you another

555
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,290
trail to go down if that's something

556
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,050
that you're after in the case but it's

557

it lists all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

where they did it files show up in the

596
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:15,739
command line much more easily than via

597
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:18,139
the Finder window and the find command

598
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:21,229
in UNIX is really nice because it's

599
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:22,488
faster lets you do things when you run

600
00:28:21,229 --> 00:28:23,749
find and you go looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a batch</font>

00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:28,329
history you've only got one user if you

603
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:32,559
find two batches you've got to users

604
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:32,559
what's wrong with that concept

605
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:39,570
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> users does a computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Mac</font>

606
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:42,480
usually have just one or is there

another one I know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> late for</font>

Socratic method but there's two users

609
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:52,530
right it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> line existo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

610
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:55,139
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Berkeley system so one of the users</font>

611
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,600
of root root does not use the bourne

612
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,630
shell by default so there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> root bash</font>

history it also makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that has</font>

614
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,400
done this route you can't find out

615
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,620
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past history</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it shows</font>

up another log those logs which as long

617
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,030
as they didn't rotate out you're fine

618
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:21,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then inside the forensics tools same</font>

thing what we're learning here from

00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,440
looking at the dates in this

621
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:30,900
conceptually is that this file<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

622
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:34,520
around since May of 2016 was last used

625
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:48,870
right here's some fun entries from a

626
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,570
project that we were working on with a

<font color="#E5E5E5">client we pulled up there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bash history</font>

628
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,169
and we found out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were poking</font>

629
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,390
around in ec2 instances there's other

630
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,590
stuff in here that identifies some

631
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,690
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing which we had</font>

to cover up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clients keys were in</font>

633
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:08,280
there like anything command line if you

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,649
put privileged information into your

your amazon web servers are kind of

important should not be in there when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

640
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,930
want to figure out what they're doing on

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:34,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac one of the things that comes up</font>

642
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:36,420
is that everybody's different you can

643
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,010
establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic patterns of behavior you</font>

644
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">can figure out generally what they did</font>

645
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,220
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out exactly</font>

646
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,030
what they did you're going to have to

647
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,010
experiment which means you need a mac

648
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:50,090
you can't use a hackintosh you can't use

649
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:53,760
a vm you need a genuine<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac to genuinely</font>

650
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:57,179
copy what they did and create identical

651
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,440
entries to show juries to prove the

652
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,550
management whatever it is that you're

653
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,740
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve the most solid way to</font>

654
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:07,620
establish what was done is to actually

655
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,600
create the behavior again and then you

656
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,399
can point line by line through what's

657
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,850
missing what's not missing what's there

658
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:18,270
and say this is exactly what they did

659
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:19,919
but it takes time in some cases you

660
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't need that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in other cases you do</font>

661
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,820
it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for establishing</font>

662

663
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,840
way to do it trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font>

664
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,340
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done or what was done and then</font>

665
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,110
claiming that it was or wasn't done

666
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,139
requires you to prove it and in some

667
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,870
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be really hard especially</font>

668
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,060
if its command line stuff so you have to

669
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at how to tie all of these logs and</font>

670
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">P lists together and that's done through</font>

671
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,380
experimentation sandboxing virtual

672
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,850
machines helps but it doesn't

673
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily get all of it especially</font>

usually at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> two files to any</font>

but there's logs for everything when you

thing but you'll go looking for

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,859
documentation online and you'll become

741

frustrated because there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

that we use to pull up the documentation

748

from Apple this is developer

749
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:59,300
documentation no so it tells developers

what they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but it doesn't</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily tell forensics people what</font>

00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,250
they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but when you're trying</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer questions about what's</font>

767
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:50,630
only read one chapter out of them what

768
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:53,480
all of this stuff does is help to create

769
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,670
a mosaic of what the user did in terms

770
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,160
of activity as opposed to just one log

771
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,240
and law enforcement in particular likes

772
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,420
to approach these things in a very

773
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,279
binary fashion they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in find</font>

774
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,619
the evidence that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think they need</font>

775
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,059
for the case and then stopped because

776
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:10,940
they're overworked they're underpaid and

777
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:15,170
they have a caseload that is way too

778
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:18,020
large but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they do that they miss</font>

certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> details which then you can come</font>

company claims that the user stole some

783
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:36,470
intellectual property looked at a PDF

784
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:38,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they could go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the system and find</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the thumbnail cast of the PDF and so on</font>

786
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,559
but they stop right there they're like

787
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:45,319
well we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evidence he looked at</font>

788
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,750
it at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and time but that doesn't</font>

789
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,720
tell you what else was going on or what

790
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,510
on the system so you come in his defense

791
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,549
and established that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop was at</font>

792
00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:01,099
Bob's house not Billy's house and now

793
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:02,720
we've got another suspect now the

794
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,040
investigation has to start back up and

795
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,839
figure out what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening with the</font>

796
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,799
laptop when it wandered over to bob's

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,720
house maybe nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's an example</font>

00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:13,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of house different pieces of the system</font>

799
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,750
log can fit together to give you a

800
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,240
different picture than what's being

801
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:27,260
presented to you by law enforcement or

802
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:29,959
by the client initially general method

803
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">ollie for testing stuff is create</font>

804
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,559
multiple test systems run the test look

805
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,329
for time date changes when you're doing

806
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,520
malware analysis anybody it going to get

807
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:47,329
into malware analysis I hear it pays

808
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:49,730
quite well no okay testing is just

809
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:53,230
seeing what changed looking to see what

810
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,230
chains how it changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> why it seems</font>

811
00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:02,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some local user data for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Safari</font>

812
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,200
I have the circle in the wrong place so

813
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,839
I have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out which I'm supposed</font>

814
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,879
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pointing at this is what changed</font>

815
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:20,299
between two boots of the system we have

816
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:24,589
a history<font color="#CCCCCC"> DB sh where is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it last session</font>

817
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:25,450
so it's up to three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago where to</font>

818
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:32,470
go

819
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:37,569
I can't find it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now local storage local</font>

820
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:39,939
storage here we go 25 16 and then 2618

821
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,589
so we know local storage changed what

822
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,400
changed it why it changed it that's what

823
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:44,400
we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

824
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,250
resources to read I don't know if that's

825
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:03,098
legible but eventually the slides will

826
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:06,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">be made available to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you we've got books</font>

00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,109
evidence but you also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

842
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,700
damaging the pc that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

843
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:47,529
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your case because if that crashes it</font>

844
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:57,160
stops<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case processing and that's a</font>

845
00:40:47,530 --> 00:41:00,280
bad thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does happen where is one</font>

846
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:03,970
of the ways that we put this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

847
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">security you surf naked when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

848
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,328
doing security work you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want any</font>

849
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,200
firewalls you don't want any a virus you

850
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:10,089
don't want anything that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

851
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,399
interfere<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the package with the</font>

852
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:14,349
processes if you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> send broken</font>

853
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,119
packets across a network it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font>

854
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:18,010
you because the network does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like</font>

855
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:23,349
broken packets so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> filters that kind</font>

856
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:25,240
of stuff figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to the</font>

857
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:27,220
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're after can be</font>

858
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,709
tricky but in the forensics world we

859
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,939
very much want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

860
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,480
machines and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nothing is</font>

861
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,849
exposed if your test environment is

862
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,980
compromised everything in your case is

863
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:39,400
compromised if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

864
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a</font>

865
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,960
kid on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and a year goes by</font>

866
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,670
all of the cases that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on are</font>

867
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,619
potentially arguable again it's a bad

868
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,789
thing so keep them off the network

869
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:53,980
isolate your work and leave the surfing

870
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:57,490
on a line<font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox you're not afraid to</font>

871
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:59,799
trash<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can fix</font>

872
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:06,899
the windows any questions while I'm

873
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:06,900
trying to the windows fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think</font>

874
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now how do we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to I don't</font>

875
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">have my monitor sharing button that's</font>

876
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:58,710
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sorry Mac problem let's go to</font>

877
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:34,929
tada<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we're back oh but now my</font>

878
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:48,309
mac is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same resolution as the screen</font>

879
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:48,309
which is horrible what are you doing I

880
00:43:56,439 --> 00:44:03,589
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> barely read that ok so is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

881
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:11,839
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that well you guys have it</font>

882
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:15,078
nice not very legible but this is the

883
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,509
sequel light browser DB browser is equal

884
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,819
in one of the free tools that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

885
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:22,309
get your hands on and if you can read up

886
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:24,679
top here we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the thumbnail</font>

887
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:26,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">cash database</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the index equal light</font>

888
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:28,449
file which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where all this stuff</font>

889
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:28,449
appears

890
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,850
thumbnails different things in here tell

891
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:53,640
you different things in its case to<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

892
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:58,860
what's going to be useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's</font>

893
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:09,299
what the thing looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like and then what</font>

894
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the other one p lists p lists</font>

895
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:18,030
generally are just not HTML markup

896
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,080
language when am I going work there's a

897
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:26,730
word what're p<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists what's the format</font>

898
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:30,319
of appeal if it's not HTML it's the yeah

899
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:32,400
the other one sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't bring today</font>

900
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,480
but there's a layered format down here

901
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:43,350
at the bottom you can see the structure

902
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:44,430
Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML so all the plist generally will</font>

903
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,650
look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this some of them are a</font>

904
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">different format but a plist viewer</font>

905
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,930
should be handled should be able to

906
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,930
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything you throw at it</font>

907
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">different bits of information which</font>

908
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:00,150
plist you're in so here we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

909
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:02,610
install history which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

910
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,500
you what got installed when which is

911
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,360
kind of useful and one of the

912
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,560
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things here is if you look</font>

913
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the numbers on the left there</font>

914
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,490
constantly growing it doesn't delete

915
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,960
anything so if somebody installs

916
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,180
something and then they delete it there

917
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,290
should still<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an entry in here it also</font>

918
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:24,830
lists things that are duplicates for

919
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:27,150
example 75 here is Q finder pro and

920
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:28,440
before that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q sync client and</font>

921
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,350
then there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> key finder pro</font>

922
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,810
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update it prompted me</font>

923
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update you find a pro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I installed the</font>

924
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:42,970
new version I got a new entry in this

925
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:46,060
file I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fun come back home</font>

926
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:49,480
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another fun one calm Microsoft</font>

927
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,740
our DC mack plist this we were looking

928
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,660
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because someone was using remote</font>

929
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:55,000
desktop to do funny things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we wanted</font>

930
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confirm that it was them we were able</font>

931
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so by the time signatures on this</font>

932
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,780
even though we couldn't find other

933
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,070
evidence that matched it on Stan mosaic

934
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:09,040
of evidence with different log files

935
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:11,460
that gives you a picture and then the

936
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,570
SMB server plist another example here

937
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:37,330
there's a name of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> macbook in</font>

938
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:39,750
question not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal ok that's the</font>

939
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:45,970
sequel I night we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

940
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:54,040
quick looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all of which is available</font>

941
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the app store here is what your Mac</font>

942
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,360
will look like after you turn on view

943
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,670
hidden files you get these red dots

944
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,900
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're able to see stuff now but</font>

945
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,940
you can't get into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're not</font>

946
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">root if you want to get into it you go</font>

947
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:13,270
to the command line or you run a process

948
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:14,410
like this as root far audit is private

949
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,240
VAR audit is one of the places that

950
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:20,140
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend time it's one of</font>

951
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,250
the key areas but you'll access it

952
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,720
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> command line you can</font>

953
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,720
probably not through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finder</font>

954
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:37,510
here's a thumbnail cash database again

955
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:50,640
but this time from inside finder you'll

956
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:50,640
get too far folders oops no problem

957
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,430
digging down through the system here bar

958
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,560
folders and then here's the user

959
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:05,290
directories it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to have is</font>

960
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,549
easy this is easy in here is for root it

961
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:09,240
will always be ZZ and there would be

962
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:12,670
anything else but you'll have a random

963
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,620
to character for the each user and then

964
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:19,410
you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a random 30 character for</font>

965
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,410
each user and then what we want is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

966
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:26,830
don't ask me what C stands for I don't

967
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:30,160
know there's the directory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

968
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:37,890
index equal light no quick look view

969
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:40,779
though system configuration information

970
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:43,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk library preferences system</font>

971
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,740
configuration makes sense a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

972
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,150
you'll find out case by case which ones

973
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:50,490
are interested in just go into the

974
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:53,290
directories and poke around<font color="#CCCCCC"> once against</font>

975
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,229
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the names are really long it</font>

976
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,180
will do quick look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> P lists so you</font>

977
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:08,050
can glance<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be tell you if it's</font>

978
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:14,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful not and what window</font>

979
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:14,370
is this no window

980
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:27,368
here is inside of an ASL log these are

981
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:35,170
sort of binary files but sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

982
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:36,930
only make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bigger there we go so you</font>

983
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:40,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see all kinds of good stuff in here</font>

984
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:42,250
somewhat binary then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again not entirely</font>

985
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,558
binary so that you can go poke around

986
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,569
with view or whatever move to the system

987
00:50:44,559 --> 00:51:03,700
quicker you can catch stuff with keyword

988
00:50:46,569 --> 00:51:20,589
searches and nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really exciting in</font>

989
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:22,720
mind yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> close ql</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> managed another useful</font>

990
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:24,400
command to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know used for quick look</font>

991
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:31,000
manage managing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickbook database</font>

992
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:36,720
and testing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> command-line files of a</font>

993
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,720
level here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another bash history look</font>

994
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:42,490
this one's mine so you can see I was

995
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:46,119
bouncing around the directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure</font>

996
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:49,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at safari library made a copy of</font>

997
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,890
bash history that would be useful if

998
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,910
somebody made a copy of something

999
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,960
because it would tell you where that

1000
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:57,190
copy went another data is important but

1001
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,569
the rest of it is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> command-line</font>

1002
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and doesn't tell you when it was</font>

1003
00:51:58,569 --> 00:52:12,779
done and that's it any questions all

1004
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:23,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you</font>

1005
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:23,020
[Applause]
