waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get my bash funny so that's</font>

kind of how I spend my time today's talk

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,920
more complicated so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,139
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the considerations involving</font>

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,238
that and the Internet of Things the role

65
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:32,440
that these devices can play with in

68
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,690
also related to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i noted that there</font>

69
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:45,700
is a digital forensics track 2 p.m.

70
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,220
today there's also a talk on digital

71
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:53,410
forensics in the home and the

72
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigation of Internet of Things so</font>

73
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,410
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about the</font>

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,660
traditional view of incident response

75
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,239
such that we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have traditions in</font>

76
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,940
this field at this point we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

77
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">also talk about the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

78
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,349
hiding in plain sight discuss some of

79
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:12,000
the challenges and considerations

80
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,000
through these devices as they relate to

81
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,849
incident response digital forensics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,019
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to start and involve every</font>

83
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:25,539
presentation I do with some ground rules

84
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,729
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is especially germane</font>

85
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:30,700
to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular topic today if you</font>

86
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:34,210
look at how Internet of Things is being

87
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,380
discussed in the media today within our

88
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,820
industry today our conferences today

89
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,250
everybody talks about the deplorable

90
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,890
state of the security of Internet of

91
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,150
Things and gee golly when are we finally

92
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,140
going to make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font>

93
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure which comes immediately to my</font>

94
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,969
first point there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> such thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

95
00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:00,010
secure system so never has been never

96
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,880
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much effort you</font>

97
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,860
put into it anybody with enough time

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,219
motivation and money will figure out how

99
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,880
to hack it so we have to start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

100
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,370
realization now the Internet of Things

101
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,760
is particularly problematic for security

102
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,700
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always fall into rule</font>

103
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,820
number two which is that anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

104
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be insecure will be despite your</font>

105
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,170
best efforts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it from the</font>

106
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:33,100
contrary how many times have you ever

107
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,680
seen in any organization where they have

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,920
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> web-based uses your interface for</font>

109
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,110
their switches or their routers and they

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,280
enabled it to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that oh you must</font>

111
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,710
use HTTPS but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you investigate it or</font>

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,919
audit it you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that sure enough</font>

113
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the HTTP option is actually still</font>

114
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,680
enabled because<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they had</font>

115
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">an issue with the switch they had to</font>

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,820
reload<font color="#CCCCCC"> the configuration from a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backup</font>

117
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,859
or something else happened the switch

118
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,010
rebooted there was a bug whatever it was

119
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,550
and the switch ended up defaulting to

120
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:14,920
its original<font color="#E5E5E5"> state which was insecure</font>

121
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:16,900
right so the third tenant is that

122
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,710
everybody wants everything cheap and

123
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,150
easy except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for security people we're</font>

124
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only ones that actually want</font>

125
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,799
security nobody else really cares so

126
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,810
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the now former CEO of Yahoo</font>

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,830
who got severely dinged both personally

128
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:40,920
and as a company due to their colossally

129
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:43,859
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> security breach last year so</font>

130
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,870
but in the consumer space and IOT space

131
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,320
especially these things need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cheap</font>

132
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,210
they need to be inexpensive and that

133
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,030
means both on the sensor side of

134
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well as devices so</font>

135
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,510
we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for that security is always</font>

136
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,570
as usual an afterthought I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font>

137
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,280
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for over 25 years</font>

138
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:10,740
security was an afterthought over 25

139
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:13,500
years ago still is today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I OT</font>

140
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,790
manufacturers are even less experienced

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,700
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the most inexperienced</font>

142
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:28,430
among us and probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in your</font>

143
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:30,900
organization's so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i OT anyway</font>

144
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,670
well there's no one specific clear

145
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,159
definition yet but in thinking through

146
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:42,840

summarized as devices that could even be

148
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,049
seemingly ordinary or traditional things

149
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,240
that are uniquely identifiable

150
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:57,390
addressable and contact able via a

151
00:07:51,240 --> 00:08:00,270

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,599
communications so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talk</font>

155
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">and interact with a human being they</font>

156
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,480
interact quite autonomously with each

they do so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

160
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,760
definitions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think Cisco's involves</font>

161
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,050

162

internet and then that is often<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

163
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,229
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt that was a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

164
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:38,130
limiting because there are cases where

165
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:40,979
these things can be just on a network

166
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:45,780
that is perhaps air-gapped such as

167
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a thing anymore and so they</font>

may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be necessarily exposed on the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet itself so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make that</font>

170
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:58,260
distinction so that's my definition

00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:00,030
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> forbes had an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> article recently in</font>

175
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:13,380
they had this chart which is from tech

of market where we're at with things and

178
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,260
it's typical of like some of Gartner's

like hype cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> Magic Quadrant types</font>

181
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,090

network security we're getting there a

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,650
little bit device security not so much

188
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:54,810
so they do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of security</font>

196
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,010
looking at it from an incident response

197
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,860
point of view often we talk about

198
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,870
incident response in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NIST framework</font>

199
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,750
that's some one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most common</font>

200
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,550
baselines for incident response and the

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:34,920
process we go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> as incident</font>

202
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:36,870
responders doing dfi our work we have

203
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,939
our various preparation leading up to

204
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,760
the incident we have the detection and

205
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,120
the analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what triggered the</font>

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,040
incident whatever that might be we look

207
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,890
at the containment eradication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

208
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,120
recovery of whatever it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

209
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:57,420
affected the systems and then we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

210
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,640
post-incident activity the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> post</font>

212
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,500
we fix it how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it better etc</font>

213
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,350
right everybody's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of familiar with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

215
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,709
so I don't know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys any of</font>

216
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,929
you do incident response but for me most

217
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:18,209
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the incident</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> response</font>

218
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:21,449
strategy and customers looks a little

219
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:23,099
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like this they have some</font>

220
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:26,429
preparation and then there's a mass

221
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,709
amount of panic they don't know what to

222
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">do and that's one of the reasons why</font>

223
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:35,488
they usually end up calling somebody

224
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:38,929
like found stone when we as responders

225
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:41,339
then go in we typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to collect</font>

226
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,839
triaging machines and collect all the

227
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,949
artifacts related to the investigation

228
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened right and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

229
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,758
most common ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that is to follow</font>

230
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,920
what's called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of volatility</font>

231
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:59,730
you're probably all familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

232
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:02,069
RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 to 27</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the RFC outlines the</font>

233
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,989
process by which is a guideline really

234
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:05,519
for the things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should collect and</font>

235
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:09,329
the order<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which you should collect</font>

236
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,929
them so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to get the</font>

237
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:15,089
memory dump of the live memory of the

238
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,790
running system we want to collect any

239
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,309
caches as well things that are

240
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,889
squirreled away for example in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> / TMP</font>

241
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,860
directory we want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

242
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:27,809
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of tables to show what</font>

243
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,319
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing at that moment in</font>

244
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:35,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">time that means ARP tables routing</font>

245
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:38,069
tables Colonel<font color="#CCCCCC"> states all that kind of</font>

246
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:42,689
stuff open<font color="#E5E5E5"> files which processes are</font>

247
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:47,878
touching which open files etc process

248
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:50,849
lists and so on then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get the</font>

249
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,730
disk temp file systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the disk</font>

250
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,189
images and then remote data and log

251
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,410
physical configuration and topology and

252
00:12:56,189 --> 00:13:01,919
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of archival media that that</font>

253
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:05,219
system touched right you're all like

254
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,350
totally familiar with this and good

255
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,529
you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering was this have</font>

256
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,419
to do with anything I'll get there so we

257
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,689
also typically work with standard tools

258
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,939
we have right blockers we have forensic

259
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:19,930
imaging software that can be either a

260
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:25,630
commercial tool like in case

261
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:27,640
ftk the free<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftk imager or autopsy which</font>

262
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,600
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source kind of equivalent of</font>

263
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,760
those and if you want to do an incident

264
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,450
that you may think ends up as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal</font>

265
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,990
investigation or even a civil complaint

266
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,490
you're going to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

267
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,709
chain-of-custody which means you're

268
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want to have evidence that is</font>

269
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,680
admissible in a court of law which means

270
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,560
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a commercial</font>

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,300
tool like in case because it's accepted

272
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,859
already as a proven methodology for

273
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,199
acquiring the data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also use tools</font>

274
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,589
like volatility which helps us analyse

275
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,910
the memory dumps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get and then</font>

276
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,880
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have in your tool kit</font>

277
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:08,730
you'll have your favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools for PDF</font>

278
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:11,680
file analysis and visual basic and

279
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,540
decoding binaries whether it's windy bug

280

281
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,680
might be you've got your bag of tricks

282
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,440
right for the different operating

283
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,969
systems probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> mostly windows does</font>

284
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,860
anybody have like tools that they use

for linux systems if they do Incident

collect all these things and we think

this chart because all I te architecture

is super simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's three-tiered</font>

348
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,340
we have a perimeter we have a web

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local network and that's it right</font>

reality life is far more complicated it

looks a lot more like the stuff on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

370
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,559
is even more complicated because you

just collected all this stuff on those

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:56,139
the entire vault of all the data

00:21:50,770 --> 00:22:01,330
accessible as well but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we look</font>

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:03,010
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the even less obvious how many of you</font>

435
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:07,750
would ever think that you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

436
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:11,010
have to do dfi our work on a gaming

437
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,010
console for example

438
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:20,290
how long is it before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nintendo</font>

switch is now a new option for you at

Pony Express to have all your hacker

441
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,500

442
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:31,090
cool actually I hope they're working on

443
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,610
that but point being that these are

444
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,370
still devices they have storage they

445
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:40,810
have cpu they have network they have an

446
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:45,040
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system they can be involved in</font>

447
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:46,929
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was a number of</font>

448
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,940
older gaming consoles<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of it as</font>

449
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the older xbox was actually one of the</font>

botnet as one of the attacking systems

452
00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:05,080
how about DVRs would you ever think to

453
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:09,459
investigate a DVR so you have boxes like

454
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,770
the Xfinity box the x1 that's a that's

455
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,540
basically a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC folks that's not even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">decent-sized hard drive to record your</font>

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:33,610
machines to this day they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux</font>

460
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:36,580
and to do the tivo app like if you have

461
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,740
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do this actually i have a TiVo</font>

462
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,480
and I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tivo because I have my</font>

463
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,000
iPad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can actually download shows</font>

464
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,890
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Teva that it's recorded for me</font>

465
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can download them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipad and</font>

466
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,690
take them with me when I'm on the road

467
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,189
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great as a road warrior but</font>

468
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:58,060
that's done through an HTTP interface

469
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,920
notice I did not say HTTPS the interface

470
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:04,120
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tivo although they do have HTTPS</font>

471
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,980
as well is also just HTTP there are a

472
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,979
number of websites that have information

473
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,020
on how you can hack your<font color="#E5E5E5"> tivo to get</font>

474
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,870
full access to the operating system so

475
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:18,220
that you can ssh into it and use it as a

476
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">regular computer would you think as an</font>

477
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,030
incident responder to do forensic

478
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,030
acquisition on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tivo</font>

479
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:35,290
but we couldn't have enough with just

480
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:37,780
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of Things as things</font>

481
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,370
like DVRs gaming consoles and things

482
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,760
that we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a network because</font>

483
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,590
networks allow us to do updates and

484
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,580
gaming with friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that</font>

485
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:53,020
now we had to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet of Things</font>

486
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:58,090
directly in the TV and there is already

487
00:24:53,020 --> 00:25:03,220
a case for this where there was a user

488
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:07,629
who had their LG television compromised

489
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:10,710
with the cyber police ransomware their

490
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,970
parents had somehow downloaded an app

491
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,090
it's undetermined whether they

492
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:18,070
downloaded it via the actual Play Store

493
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,290
or whether they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other means</font>

494
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,149
but somehow they got an app on their

495
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,540
television so that they could watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

496
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">movie and halfway through the movie the</font>

498

00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:49,030
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world example of the</font>

501
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:55,540

504
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:04,080
they actually talked about some research

505
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:08,020
that's been done on the Samsung TVs and

506
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">Samsung across the board has an</font>

probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Asian pronunciation so they</font>

510
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:25,060
have this operating system widely based

511
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:30,010
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android but they fully customized it</font>

512
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:32,860
and the research pointed out that they

513
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,379
had so much wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this thing they</font>

514
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,620
said it was so amateurish the way

515
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,500
they've done any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

516
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,840
security if they've done security<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all</font>

517
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:48,530
for example there is liberal use of the

518
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:50,540
c function string copy any of you had

519

521
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,490
anybody actually do see as opposed to

522
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,809
like java string copy has long since

523
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,660
been considered one of the most

524

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,290

529
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,770
from what little I know about c knows

530
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:26,540
that you use other functions rather than

531
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:29,179
string copy these guys use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all over</font>

538
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:55,400
further these two little gadgets may

539
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,660
look a little unfamiliar to you because

540
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,500
you're used to seeing them in their

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:20,030
takes to do forensic imaging or incident

547

response if you have to deal with one of

553
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,920
but it turns out that there's a lot of

00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:39,470
glue holding these things together they

555
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,700
gave the dot one of the worst ratings in

556
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:46,130
terms of its ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be taken apart</font>

557
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:49,340
but each of these if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:08,429
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these apart there is a cpu there's 32</font>

575
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:10,770
megs of storage it may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem like a</font>

576
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:13,740
lot these days this thing talks the

577
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:18,000
ZigBee protocol which is known to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

578
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:21,679
fairly easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack or exploit and you</font>

579
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,679
get a whole nice little sock on a chip

580
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:29,429
so we have the smart stuff in general

581
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:32,879
not just the ikea but we've got of

582
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,460
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> phillips you we Mo's which are</font>

583
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:44,520
also marketed into the belkin brand for

584
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:46,110
smart outlets we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> T something</font>

585
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,790
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot the name it eludes me</font>

586
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,110
right now another manufacturer the

587
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,280
cheaper version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the light bulbs that</font>

588
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:55,050
are like two<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philips you and so on so</font>

589
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got all these other things now</font>

590
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:03,210
that are on the network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

591
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but when I</font>

592
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,080
mentions igby and

593
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:09,470
previous slide one of the reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

594
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,399
was mentioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

595
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:16,640
some researchers over<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Europe who</font>

596
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,880
found out that they could take the

597
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,390
Philips hue lights and without even

598
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,090
having access to the hub without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

599
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,520
access to that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though Phillips has</font>

600
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,320
actually done a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things smart in</font>

601
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,590
terms of their security they've done

602
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,809
certificate pinning they've done trusted

603
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,279
trust establishment and trusted

604
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,500
connections with certificates and all

605
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,850
this other stuff that supposedly any

606
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,380
light bulb<font color="#E5E5E5"> attached to a hub is supposed</font>

607
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,320
to only trust that hub and the other

608
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,610
lights that are in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> little network</font>

609
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,500
they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that that was easily</font>

610
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:55,270
exploitable and they could rewrite the

611
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:58,490
operating system on the light bulb and

612
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,168
then have that light bulb attack every

613
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,970
other light bulb and they only had to be

614
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:04,580
within 400<font color="#CCCCCC"> metres of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first light</font>

615
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,289
bulb to do this and so they have a

616
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,740
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool video online where you can</font>

617
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:11,750
watch that they then take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a drone that's</font>

618
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,029
flying in a park<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the street from</font>

619
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,220
this building and they play with every

620
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:19,340
light in the building making them turn

621
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">on and off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in different colors and you</font>

622
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,678
know moving in time to various like

623
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:28,789
heavy metal music or whatnot and click

624
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do we do is</font>

625
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:35,210
incident responders as companies and

626
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,549
universities and other organizations and

627
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:40,309
government all start using these smart

628
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:42,440
light bulbs because smart valuables are

629
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:45,440
cool I like telling Alexa to turn the

630
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,880
lights on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> off much easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

631
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting up and going over to the actual</font>

632
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,470
switch I like having the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wemo smart</font>

633
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,600
outlet feed the cat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning so</font>

634
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have to get up and then i</font>

635
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:03,590
can ask Alexa was the cat fed right we

636
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,210
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that convenience so organizations</font>

637
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,168
are going to start putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

638
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:12,559
in business space in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

639
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:16,370
commercial space so think about that

640
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">implication think about when you go to</font>

641
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:24,350
play with your smart thermostat

642
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:27,289
and it demands<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin before it'll</font>

643
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:31,998
change the temperature what could

644
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:33,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly go wrong right nest thermostats</font>

645
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:39,830
have been known to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

646
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:42,470
variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks as well there was also</font>

647
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:45,999
even to how this can go terribly

648
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:49,570
terribly wrong for us a case in Finland

649
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:52,070
anybody hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the poor fins</font>

650
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,230
there was a bunch of residential

651
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:58,189
buildings in Finland that were managed

652
00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:04,309
by the voltea energy company this is in

653
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:06,980
winter in Finland that due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

654
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:11,239
distributed denial-of-service attack on

655
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:14,990
DNS in general that<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack had a</font>

656
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:18,199
reflected outcome that it took out the

657
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:20,750
thermostats in four or five residential

658
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:25,689
buildings in Finland and literally

659
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:30,109
turned off the heat in the winter in

660
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:33,020
Finland now fortunately in that

661
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:35,119
particular case they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

662
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,219
respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly as incident responders</font>

663
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,490
and they did get the systems up and

664
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,319
running again within an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

665
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,629
can say somebody who's lived in Finland

666
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:47,299
for a few years the buildings are very

667
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:49,489
well insulated and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only lose</font>

668
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:52,339
heat for an hour it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that big of a</font>

669
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:56,569
deal but if you lose heat for like a day

670
00:34:52,339 --> 00:35:01,460
or two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three then you've got a</font>

671
00:34:56,569 --> 00:35:04,970
problem imagine the inverse where if you

672
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:11,920
could in homes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phoenix Arizona for</font>

673
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:15,970
example turn on the heat in July and

674
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:19,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">then say give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred Bitcoin</font>

675
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,899
before i unlock your thermostat and give

676
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:25,279
you your heating control<font color="#CCCCCC"> dock so you can</font>

turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a/c back on now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine all of</font>

that transposed to businesses we already

00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:51,319
they did a bunch of work on a variety of

<font color="#E5E5E5">bring up baby monitors is not that</font>

700
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll necessarily see that within a</font>

701
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,790
company or an organization where you as

702
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,450
an incident responder may need to do

703
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:55,640
forensic acquisition of a baby monitor

704
00:36:52,450 --> 00:37:02,419
my point about the baby monitors is the

705
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:04,400
next one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> home security in the</font>

wash dishes it washes laboratory

827
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,440

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:46,330
are clean from nasty bad bugs and stuff

833
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,590
so what

834
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,450
we go wrong with that well if you have a

other meal a dishwasher like it in the

842
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:16,970
market how about I just tweaked the

843
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:20,770
programming on it so that instead of the

required amount of disinfection agent I

845
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:31,850
put in only a quarter of that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font>

probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not right so</font>

00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,300
when we're talking about digital

858
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,690
forensics and incident response and how

859
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:21,790
do we acquire the artifacts how do we

860
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:23,170
triage these systems it's a bit of a

861
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,660
challenge I don't have all the answers

862
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,220
today sorry to say if you were expecting

863
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,930
that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have like some</font>

864
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:33,160
whiz-bang tool that could do all of this

865
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:34,960
i am going to disappoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but it's</font>

866
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:40,149
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember what all of these</font>

867
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are at the end of the day they</font>

868
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:47,650
have cpu they've got some kind of GPU in

869
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,420
some cases especially anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

870
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:57,790
deals with video we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> I o of some</font>

871
00:45:52,420 --> 00:46:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind we have storage and we have</font>

872
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:07,330
networking so what do we have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

873
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:09,190
of the day we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have computers so when</font>

874
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,610
you're considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> it remember that a</font>

875
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,170
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things when I went back in</font>

876
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,210
the set originally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody wanted</font>

877
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:20,560
everything cheap and easy except for the

878
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">security people well we go with Android</font>

879
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:27,310
or Linux I know okay technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

880
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:31,180
is also Linux but will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and</font>

881
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:33,940
Linux the challenge with these suckers

882
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:36,970
is not the actual operating system are

883
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,950
getting the storage copy the challenge

884
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,020
is doing it while the system is still

885
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:44,049
running so that we preserve the order of

886
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,520
volatility and the reason why that's a

887
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,980
challenge is because these things are

888
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,320
very very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access there's</font>

889
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,000
usually no physical ports on the medium

890
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:56,080
anymore they're designed where you press

891
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,300
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> button and it has Wi-Fi so you connect</font>

892
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,069
your phone to that access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

893
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,450
tell it by the way here's the real Wi-Fi

894
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,160
you're supposed to connect to and it

895
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:05,919
sets itself up and everybody's happy and

896
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,700
it's super easy and grandma can even do

897
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,350
it and life is good but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means from</font>

898
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,569
an incident response point of view that

899
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have to pollute a lot</font>

900
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,410
more

901
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:18,839
because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to only at best</font>

902
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:23,578
maybe have remote access to the system

903
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:25,529
if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky we can try things like if</font>

904
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:29,699
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a port we could try like a</font>

905
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:33,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">DMA memory attack for example using</font>

906
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:35,130
something like the bash bunny like I

907
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,929
said I'm waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for mine I'm hoping to</font>

908
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:42,869
explore that further and continue this

909
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:44,939
research but we may find that also your

910
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:47,039
other challenge is a political one in

911
00:47:44,939 --> 00:47:50,578
that although the device may be

912
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:52,169
critically compromised or maybe not from

913
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the organizational point of view they're</font>

914
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,459
like yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

915
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:59,609
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blah blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever the</font>

916
00:47:56,459 --> 00:48:01,709
device is they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> care but in the</font>

917
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:03,538
meantime that device is part of for

918
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:06,058
example the more I botnet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

919
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:07,949
attacking other people now that

920
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:12,319
organization is liability<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and</font>

921
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:14,999
civil issues that they have to deal with

922
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,099
vendors are often very reticent to

923
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:18,660
acknowledge or offer assistance the

924
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:20,459
number of researchers that have been

925
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,209
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> research and how to break these</font>

926
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:25,979
things because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the first thing we</font>

927
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:29,299
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do right we all love to break</font>

928
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:32,459
stuff every talk black hat<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con</font>

929
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:35,640
secure West Virginia everybody loves the

930
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:41,759
breaking stuff really bad at getting

931
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:43,408
people to do the building stuff but we

932
00:48:41,759 --> 00:48:44,880
at least work in a community where if

933
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:46,529
you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a Google or</font>

934
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,179
Microsoft and others we've got

935
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:53,009
vulnerability disclosure we've got

936
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:57,089
incident handling guidelines me lady

937
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:59,579
does not the researcher actually had a

938
00:48:57,089 --> 00:49:02,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">really tough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain to</font>

939
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:06,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lay by their dishwasher disinfection</font>

940
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:12,029
thing had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue they didn't care they</font>

941
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:14,189
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> no intention of fixing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have</font>

942
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:18,359
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue there I don't have an answer</font>

943
00:49:14,189 --> 00:49:20,249
for that one either so you're also

944
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,890
probably thinking well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all</font>

945
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:25,149
home stuff you show baby monitors and

946
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:29,470
home security systems and

947
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:31,750
and refrigerators and stuff we work on

948
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:35,589
commercial stuff we work for businesses

949
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:37,000
for government and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot but you'd</font>

950
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:41,558
probably be wrong in thinking that

951
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,690
because a lot of this stuff exists

952
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,760
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company you're even we've got</font>

953
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">these nice sharp TVs here that are</font>

954
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing me my slides I don't know if</font>

955
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,380
these are smart TVs or not but a lot of

956
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:56,710
places have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart TVs even for</font>

957
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:59,920
things as innocuous as the cafeteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

958
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:03,099
the company's campus has the fancy

959
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,039
Samsung TVs to display the cafeteria

960
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:08,170
menu every day so they're in the

961
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,510
organization you're just not looking for

962
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,670
them you you ignore that as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

963
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,770
ignore the light for the fire system

964
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,839
here in the back of the room right it's

965
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:21,700
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there you just tune it out</font>

966
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:24,880
right now fortunately there is research

967
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:27,308
underway I was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy when I was</font>

968
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,119
doing my research on this topic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

969
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:34,240
talk that even back in my neck of the

970
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,099
woods in Burlington Vermont the Leahy

971
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,779
center for digital investigation at

972
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:41,140
Champlain College has actually been

973
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:42,849
doing active research into not just IOT

974
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,950
security that's one of the things we got

975
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away from everybody is talking</font>

976
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,259
about IOT security but if you go back to

977
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tenants I told you at the original</font>

978
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of the talk way back almost an</font>

979
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,368
hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago there's no such thing as a</font>

980
00:50:56,529 --> 00:51:03,160
secure system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to now start</font>

981
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:04,869
saying you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to not</font>

982
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,730
focus as much on trying to make these

983
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">things more secure but assume that</font>

984
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:11,920
they're not and assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

985
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:14,970
not how do we fix things and make things

986
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:19,359
better how do we actually approach

987
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:21,308
investigative aspects of dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

988
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,640
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they are part of a</font>

989
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:28,500
botnet when they are part of whatever

990
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,868
the incident is there are some other

991
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,880
research papers that have been talking

992
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:35,410
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as well digital forensics the</font>

00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:41,660
and I provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL there and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

other URLs in my slide notes which I'm

00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,799
happy to provide as well that are the

998
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:49,250
background of the different things we're

1002
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:59,870
Triple E started thinking about this as

1003
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:01,640
well so we are at this point now where

1004
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:06,400
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are starting to take an</font>

1005
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest in as I am how do we get</font>

1006
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:13,430
acquisition of forensics information and

1007
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:16,790
Incident Response stuff from the

1008
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet of Things so unfortunately I</font>

1009
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,670
don't have any better answers than that

1010
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,070
but I hope maybe next year I could tell

1011
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about what I've come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with as I</font>

1012
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:27,260
continue my work on the subject to

1013
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,790
figure this out so at least start

1014
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,610
thinking about when you're doing this

1015
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:34,130
kind of stuff what are some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

1016
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I need to think about beyond the</font>

1017
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:42,500
pc beyond the servers there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more</font>

1018
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:45,529
stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out about even if</font>

1019
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:50,450
it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes okay find the tivo</font>

1020
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:55,370
wasn't involved the refrigerator wasn't

1021
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:57,830
involved whatever it is that it's also

1022
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:59,060
okay to say that yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not part of</font>

1023
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:05,779
this but at least you thought about it

1024
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:09,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you documented it right so got like</font>

1025
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:13,000
maybe five minutes roughly kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorta</font>

1026
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,000
any questions bill

1027
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:55,110
yeah I think it's a there has to be a

1028
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:58,060
lot of demonstration that there's a

1029
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,160
there's enough of this happening where

1030
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,049
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are needed first before they're</font>

1031
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,509
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put the resources into</font>

1032
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,430
figuring it out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of sad</font>

1033
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're continuing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same cycle</font>

1034
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:11,399
of we're going to add security<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1035
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,720
going to add that stuff after the fact

1036
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:32,710
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than trying to build it in to</font>

1037
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:35,290
begin with yep it's and also an open

1038
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:39,190
thing for any of you they want to start

1039
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:43,000
a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> business figuring out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to do</font>

1040
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:44,800
that the good thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since a</font>

1041
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,750
lot of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are easily hacked it</font>

1042
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,700
means you can attack the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1043
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:53,170
remote access to it to hopefully acquire

1044
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:57,189
the information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> white but anybody</font>

1045
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">else have any questions comments if not</font>

1046
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,570
I very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your time I</font>

1047
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:06,930
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found it interesting something</font>

1048
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:06,930
to think about and thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having me</font>
