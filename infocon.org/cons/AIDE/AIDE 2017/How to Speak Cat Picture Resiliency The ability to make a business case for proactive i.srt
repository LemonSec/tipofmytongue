hit right you can't answer that what is

201
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:16,029
the percent chance that we'll get it how

202
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,600
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it gonna cost me as we get hit</font>

203
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:24,009
and most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like little preparation</font>

to expound on that if we're gonna say

212
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:51,199
the percent put in certain lift are you

213
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:52,790
sure really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lindsey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> young look I don't</font>

214
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:54,680
know when could be wrong could be next

215
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,349
year but what's gonna happen Josh you

216
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,290
know it's really funny that when

217
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,000
businesses do get sick by a breach or

218
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:07,040
where they have an insider threat with

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,680
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there is some form of removing</font>

220
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,329
money in skin in any way from

221
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:18,349
those businesses end up spending more on

222
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:21,740
security then when they're either

223
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:24,260
because it breached of course I mean you

224
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,330
got massive cost associated is the

225
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,230
response that's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks I know</font>

226
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,630
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this already</font>

227
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,490
apologized but the costs include

228
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,250
everything from media remediation

229
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:38,089
ingredients a response a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term code</font>

230
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,470
changes will also productivity credit

231
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,170
monitoring depending what kind of build

232
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:45,140
that you've got all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different a</font>

233
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:49,180
cost associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an infant and those</font>

234
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:51,649
costs on the nitrous be unpleasant so

235
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,060
the Powder River business doesn't think

236
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,580
we need to think about those costs

237
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">relative and are you sure is the conger</font>

238
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,470
I mean really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to tell me that and</font>

239
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,209
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it another spin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close out more now</font>

240
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,680
than 50,000 hour later that you can

241
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily add into a number that by the way</font>

242
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,219
so when a business looks at security or

243
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,230
IT in general nine times out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

247
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:25,010
them money right so to be able to

248
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,230
understand how to translate that you

249
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:31,189

different languages from our to business

251
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,110

and then you think it is this relevant

488
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:07,399
so in making it business relevant I hope

489
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:10,399
that we've been able to get the point

490
