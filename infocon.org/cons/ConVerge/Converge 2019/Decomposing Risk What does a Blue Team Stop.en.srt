1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,450
and about six months ago with how to

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:13,610
sort of provide a little bit more in

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,260
nation on what are the risks that

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,650
actually deploying a dedicated blue team

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,150
would actually stop so when we were

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,130
looking at this problem in our threat

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,659
intelligence lab basically what we were

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,610
looking to do was how could we actually

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,930
take just like the generic nature of

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,460
risk that's actually out there and

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,539
decompose this into a number of

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,039
different data points that we could

13
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,119
actually support with some of the

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,239
measurements that we actually have

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,769
access to so I'm gonna sort of open up

16
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,970
I'm gonna talk a little bit about where

17
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,160
we actually source our data what the

18
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,239
data looks like I'm gonna sort of lay

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,459
the cards on the table for what our

20
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,280
sampling biases are in the data set that

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,690
we have access to and sort of discuss a

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,970
little bit more about how we actually

23
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,940
tackled the problem we'll take a look

24
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,140
and tell the results in this one so the

25
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,729
the big things that we're taking a look

26
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,890
at here are what are the chances that

27
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,150
will experience a breach of like typical

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,100
perimeter controls that would require

29
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,739
some sort of sock or blue team response

30
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,479
action we'll talk a little bit about how

31
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,940
many assets we typically see being hit

32
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,908
by breaches over the course of a year

33
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,590
within a particular industry or

34
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,270
geographic location and then we'll also

35
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,009
talk a little bit about in the first

36
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,939
section here what does a breach actually

37
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,680
look like and how are we actually

38
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,669
responding to it so you get a better

39
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,109
idea of what that looks like as well and

40
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,340
this data set can be used to plan a

41
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:27,380
number of different countermeasures

42
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,750
hopefully it's useful to you in a

43
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,130
variety of different ways but we can

44
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,810
talk a little bit about how we can play

45
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,789
an effective responses how we can keep

46
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,140
the sort of data up to date and maybe do

47
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,950
a little bit of Q&A discussion at the

48
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,219
end of this so just to get things

49
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,130
rolling our data set is comprised of

50
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:48,949
about 1,800 Network sensors those are

51
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,990
deployed at internet choke points we are

52
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,130
running full packet capture on them so

53
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,600
that we can actually take a look and do

54
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,100
forensic inspection of what it is that

55
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,009
we're seeing and we're running a number

56
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,960
of different IDs tools these are

57
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,520
deployed specifically to take a look at

58
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,589
what the clean side traffic is looking

59
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,569
like after all the perimeter controls

60
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,330
are actually running through on the

61
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:11,150
endpoint side for visibility there we're

62
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,500
talking about 87,000 endpoints that we

63
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,450
have out there those are CB response

64
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,620
agents and we're running a number of

65
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,929
different feeds on them for detection

66
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,629
purposes as well as some additional

67
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,569
tools of our own design to try and take

68
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,980
a look at

69
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,700
some of the raw data in a different way

70
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,609
so this data set is taken from 600 or so

71
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,260
organizations deployed around 2000

72
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,989
different sites it represents 28

73
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,690
industries 50 countries and about 185

74
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:41,640
thousand plus users our data set we

75
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,379
mostly are protecting financial

76
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,578
industries so most of the data that

77
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,190
you're going to see taken from our data

78
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:49,290
set is finance oriented but we also have

79
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,819
a fairly decent sized pool of other and

80
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,798
that breaks down across a number of

81
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,750
different things so if we take a look at

82
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,239
how that breaks down you can see that

83
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,099
we've got two other big sections in

84
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,739
legal and technology but we also have a

85
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,298
slew of smaller data that's coming from

86
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,310
a variety of different medium sized

87
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,319
organizations that are out there we are

88
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,909
definitely talking about mid sized

89
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,159
organizations here not super large

90
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,810
organizations so this is about perimeter

91
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,370
controls and and what it is that we're

92
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,840
responding to on the inside of those for

93
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,480
that particular type of demographic if

94
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,010
we talk about the typical perimeter

95
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,690
defenses like what's ahead of us so

96
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,340
we're not talking about things that are

97
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,220
being stopped by next-gen firewalls

98
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,239
we're not talking about things that are

99
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,620
stopped by the IPS systems I mean

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,819
sometimes they're things that should be

101
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,160
stopped by those things but these are

102
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,810
the things that we're typically seeing

103
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,410
deployed ahead of our monitoring service

104
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,639
so if we run in there basically we're

105
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,180
looking at things that are behind these

106
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,459
so on the endpoint side typically most

107
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,290
of our clients are also running mature

108
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,940
antivirus or next-gen antivirus

109
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,948
technology in addition to the CBE

110
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,030
response agent so we're not talking

111
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,199
about the things that are picked up and

112
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,540
stopped by those things in terms of what

113
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,030
we're actually doing our side we're

114
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,858
looking at monitoring and hunting we do

115
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,680
periodic hunting exercises that are sort

116
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,629
of ad-hoc where we go and we take a look

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,709
at a just like the raw data set and see

118
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,198
if we can find anything else that's

119
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,730
interesting in it we do investigations

120
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,310
into things that are just being picked

121
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,988
up in triage with the internally

122
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,120
deployed IDs to see if anything's gotten

123
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,729
through more permissive configurations

124
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,210
that are set up with next-gen firewalls

125
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:29,099
and then we respond so typically this is

126
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,599
another part of what it is that we do

127
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,700
and it does actually definitely have a

128
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:34,530
ramification on the data because what

129
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,210
we're talking about with

130
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,530
is everything that we actually have as a

131
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,140
data point represents something that we

132
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,520
saw and did something to contain so if

133
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,740
we're talking about the number of assets

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,359
that are impacted this is going to

135
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,550
assume that you are doing something to

136
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,110
actually contain the breaches I can't

137
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,610
really show you stuff where we didn't

138
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:56,490
have anybody engaged and then it's

139
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,990
follow-up after we actually detect

140
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,550
reaches we have a TI team that's looking

141
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,110
at you know going in and doing some

142
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,510
additional research into those they try

143
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,340
and do sampling across different

144
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,659
situations that you sort of do follow-up

145
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,979
analysis to get us some additional

146
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,030
characteristics and we can talk a little

147
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,180
bit about that research as well so data

148
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,849
point deep dive basically what we have

149
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,890
here is a tool that'll just sort of let

150
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,180
us run through what we'd be talking

151
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,890
about as a single data point with

152
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,360
interset so we're talking about tens of

153
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,000
thousands of these sorts of incidents

154
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,169
but to sort of walk you through what one

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,919
incident would look like and what the

156
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:33,900
data sort of represents this is just a

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,849
malicious document I believe it's a

158
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,479
phishing situation that we can run

159
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,790
through but what it looks like is we

160
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,280
might pick up something where we have a

161
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,860
user who has been successfully fished

162
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,479
they've run a mal doc and we see some

163
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,130
sort of reputational indicator that says

164
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,050
that their machine is now beating out to

165
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,630
a CNC so this is a case where we've seen

166
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,340
phishing bypass the defenses and we have

167
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,810
like a reputational indicator or some

168
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,340
other reason that's being picked up by

169
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,169
one of our detecting technologies that's

170
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,010
saying hey we need to go take a look at

171
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,570
that and we've got like our own sort of

172
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,280
sim in here but I mean this would apply

173
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,990
to anybody's sim if you were taking a

174
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,500
look at it is just a starting point for

175
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,540
your investigation then what we'd be

176
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,580
looking at doing is sort of like

177
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,990
reviewing what's actually going on take

178
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,289
a look at you know just address

179
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,490
information start digging deeper if we

180
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,260
take a look at that you know we can see

181
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,820
if there's any reputation Olinda caters

182
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,810
that might increase the confidence that

183
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,180
we're actually taking a look at

184
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,720
something bad we can talk about initial

185
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,970
analysis where we would be getting sort

186
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,530
of into essentially just sort of basic

187
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,270
triage functions and you can think about

188
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,349
implementing these within your own sock

189
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,120
as well where you're just sort of like

190
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,770
sifting through what are the things that

191
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,000
you would actually do deep response into

192
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,349
and maybe some of the things that you

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,160
might discard if

194
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:54,870
you know obviously benign and then if we

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,990
see that we actually have sort of let me

196
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,550
just take a look here sorry one of the

197
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,370
other things that you might want to use

198
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,440
in here is contextual information about

199
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,700
sort of things that you know might be

200
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,790
relevant to your business that can also

201
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,780
weed some of that stuff out but assuming

202
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,860
that we've actually done all those

203
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,179
things and we're coming back with

204
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,650
something that's actually interesting to

205
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,230
take a look at we would probably be

206
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,200
taking a look at raw wire confirmation

207
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,210
on our side which would let us go into

208
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,650
here and see you know well what what

209
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,799
what communication is actually going

210
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,390
back we can see in this case if we're

211
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
taking a look at the the traffic around

212
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,890
that we're actually affecting any

213
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,490
document down and then when we go into

214
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,840
it our our side for investigation we

215
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,300
typically look at actually extracting

216
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,280
the file out trying to you know

217
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,380
reconstruct that either out of the pcap

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,000
or we could be reconstructing it if you

219
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,710
don't have access to full packet capture

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,750
on your side you could also take a look

221
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,489
at just taking a look at like summarized

222
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,930
data that's coming off of something like

223
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,490
bro logs and see if you can reconstruct

224
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,890
the domain that it was actually sourcing

225
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,550
a mail dock from when you have the mail

226
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,349
dock we typically would run some sort of

227
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,910
sandbox analysis on it to try and get an

228
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,130
understanding of what it actually is

229
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,540
what it does there's a variety of

230
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,000
different tools that are out there for

231
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,180
this I think on our side right now we're

232
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,710
using a hybrid analysis tool we've used

233
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,120
kakou in the past which is an open

234
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,349
source project I know there's also a

235
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,030
number of commercial ones that are out

236
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,020
there but all are good things to give

237
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,750
you more information when you're

238
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,240
actually taking a look at it

239
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,860
and then from an end point side you have

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,020
the whole side of taking a look into it

241
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,310
from what is actually running on the

242
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,650
local machine can you actually figure

243
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,419
out what's going on in something like CB

244
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,159
response can you figure out you know

245
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,679
were there any weird processes that

246
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,150
respond after they open the document etc

247
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,859
etc so from our side in this particular

248
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,920
case we're taking a look at it we do see

249
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,330
that we see you know some some post

250
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,770
download opening of the file and then

251
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,720
you know some PowerShell commands

252
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,090
actually running and doing some fairly

253
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,370
suspicious things that are actually

254
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,740
running on that particular agent we can

255
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,860
see binary analysis where we're sort of

256
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,080
taking a look at

257
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,810
what what is what is actually coming

258
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,520
down into this machine etc etc so I'm

259
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,050
just I'm sort of skimming through all of

260
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,279
this if we do want to go back to it and

261
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,319
take a look I'm more than happy to

262
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,890
discuss it in in greater depth but I

263
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,360
just sort of wanted to give basically

264
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,680
like an idea of the sorts of things that

265
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,900
actually represent each data point

266
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,089
that's in here so I can talk in in

267
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,150
detail about like some of the ones that

268
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,620
we have for for scenario data this does

269
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,180
not necessarily reflect what every

270
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,529
single incident was but it reflects the

271
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,120
type of things that we're doing in order

272
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,740
to qualify the data that you're seeing

273
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,779
as part of the data set that relief that

274
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,180
we are releasing today so it's taking a

275
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,939
look so process inspection what it's

276
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,060
doing and basically at the conclusion of

277
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,760
sandbox analysis and all of this what we

278
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,449
are taking a look at from this is

279
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,390
essentially just how do we actually

280
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,800
classify the incident so as the analyst

281
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,180
is going through they're taking a look

282
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,560
at it and and we have a number of

283
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,760
different incident types that we're

284
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,209
going to talk about today in the data

285
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,680
set one of them is phishing so when we

286
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,870
talk about phishing we're talking about

287
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,819
some something that has occurred where

288
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,070
we've actually seen a phishing hit a

289
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,839
user and we've either seen and confirmed

290
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,339
that the user has submitted credentials

291
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,200
out to the third party or we've

292
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,640
confirmed that they've actually you know

293
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,950
followed through and installed something

294
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,770
and and run something on the machine if

295
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,660
we're talking about like the malware

296
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,370
incidents in our data set what we're

297
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,770
talking about is something where we've

298
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,390
had an analyst go in there and confirm

299
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,890
that we've actually seen code execute on

300
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,990
a machine that did have some sort of

301
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,850
malicious purpose and from the exploit

302
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,800
site this is actually sort of

303
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,770
interesting I was looking at a talk

304
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,089
today from from Michael Brightman and

305
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,130
what we're looking at is we're just

306
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,420
basically confirming that an exploit was

307
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,170
observed on the inside of the perimeter

308
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,579
and it was interacting with something

309
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,040
that it should never have been able to

310
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,780
actually access so it's you have a

311
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,890
protected server and the protected

312
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,839
server is behind something like a

313
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,970
next-gen firewall or web application

314
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,980
firewall it may be both and still you're

315
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,360
actually seeing you know something

316
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,890
coming through from the internet that's

317
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,420
interacting with that server because it

318
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,699
has to expose something legitimate and

319
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,240
the the exploits are actually being seen

320
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,240
on the inside

321
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,170
our typical response is basically just

322
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,209
like basic host isolation containment

323
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,400
remediation we generally pass off to the

324
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,380
client but the idea here is that in this

325
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,090
data set we're talking we're taking a

326
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,380
look at stuff or once we see something

327
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,850
come through we generally try and deny

328
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,830
the attackers infrastructure that's

329
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,270
lonsurf launching the attack and sort of

330
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,190
limit the damage that it can't spread

331
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,510
within the environment and when we when

332
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,130
we take a look at impact data that's

333
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:40,189
that's going to become a lot a lot more

334
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:43,120
relevant so if I take a look at let's

335
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,120
just pull back up here

336
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:57,689
so the thinking here we're taking a look

337
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:58,829
at a data set we're talking about tens

338
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:00,719
to hundreds of thousands of

339
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,790
investigations that look like this and

340
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,499
what we're trying to do is sort of see

341
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,118
if we can draw any conclusions about

342
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:07,529
what the probabilities are that we're

343
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:09,989
going to see security incidents at

344
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:12,209
particular locations over particular

345
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:13,949
time periods so the way that we approach

346
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,929
this in our study was we were basically

347
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,029
treating each sensor that we actually

348
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,290
had that was out there as a convenient

349
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,869
sample that's taken from a general

350
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,519
population and you can think about sort

351
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:25,019
of subdividing your data or restricting

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,489
your convenience sample to things that

353
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:30,119
are more relevant to your particular

354
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:31,679
industry or your particular like sort of

355
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:33,329
demographic but what we're gonna

356
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,970
basically do then is we're gonna record

357
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:38,069
a boolean value about whether or not the

358
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,230
sensor was participating in one of these

359
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:41,729
different types of incidents and

360
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,470
responding to one of these types within

361
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,629
a time window so if we're talking about

362
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,679
something like malware for example what

363
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:48,629
we might do is you might start

364
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,360
generating data points and we say okay

365
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:52,920
well did the sensor participate in a

366
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,449
malware incident this month like did we

367
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,179
have to actually respond to a malware on

368
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,738
the queenside this month yes or no what

369
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,629
about if we extend that to two months to

370
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:02,429
three months what if we look at it in

371
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:03,869
March and April in May and then you can

372
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,040
think about repeating this over and over

373
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:06,179
and over again for all the different

374
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,949
types of incidents that we could be

375
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,059
talking about and all of the different

376
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:11,459
time periods that we might want to

377
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,929
represent in the data set so the the raw

378
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,089
data that we have is actually just going

379
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:17,699
to be looking at the incidents

380
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,199
themselves and what time that they

381
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:21,628
actually occurred on but this is sort of

382
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,189
how you can use those that raw incident

383
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,110
data in order to make a bit of a

384
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:27,809
statistical projection about what you

385
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,639
might actually have seen if if you were

386
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:32,118
trying to figure out what it is that you

387
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,529
need to go look for so we repeat this

388
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:37,049
across you know all these different

389
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,749
types and what we're basically left with

390
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,519
is a data set that looks like a sampling

391
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:43,769
without replacement data set so you can

392
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,069
apply hypergeometric distribution

393
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,689
analysis to that and there's like I mean

394
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,248
I don't know actually how to reconstruct

395
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,719
that myself but unfortunately there are

396
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:53,610
wonderful libraries in Python that will

397
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,529
that will apply that that statistical

398
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,079
pattern to the data and then what that

399
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,429
can do is it can let us take a look and

400
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,099
see what the confidence interval would

401
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:03,929
be projecting from data set that we have

402
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,160
which is our observed rate to a

403
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,779
projected best-case

404
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,790
in worst case scenario for what we can

405
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,829
think about the general population

406
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,000
having if we're if we're deciding

407
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:13,709
whether or not we actually want to

408
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,319
deploy a sensor into a particular area

409
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:19,229
or for deciding you know trying to make

410
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,149
maybe a budget case to somebody that

411
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,649
would you know maybe I would really like

412
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,579
to implement a monitoring program and

413
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,670
I'm having difficulty actually

414
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,930
justifying the budget then you can take

415
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,439
some of this data and maybe build it

416
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:34,620
into a case like that

417
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:36,240
so if we think about how do we like

418
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,980
actually gather the data assess

419
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,779
potential impact from security incidents

420
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,550
over a time period that was a bit of a

421
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,959
tougher problem in the risks I'd like if

422
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,729
we think about risk we're talking about

423
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,079
impact we're talking about probability

424
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,060
we've sort of looked a little bit about

425
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,420
probability right now question is how do

426
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,500
we actually address impact and

427
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,969
ultimately this was this was an area

428
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,350
that we found a bit harder so I'm gonna

429
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,000
share the data that I have and I'm

430
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,350
hoping that you guys out there will have

431
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,509
some data about your environment from

432
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,949
your side that can help you add to this

433
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,939
data and think about what the impact

434
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,300
would actually look like in your

435
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:08,189
environment but what we can do is we can

436
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,620
show a distribution curve of what the

437
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:12,060
number of impacted assets and users were

438
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,500
from our data pool so if you think about

439
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,449
what it is that we're doing in response

440
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,040
when we detect an incident we're trying

441
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,689
to contain it as fast as possible and

442
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,610
then we're we're basically creating a

443
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,579
log of how many different assets were

444
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,709
actually impacted so sometimes when an

445
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,359
incident comes in it'll spread sometimes

446
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:29,130
people will you know not be able to

447
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,410
repair a hole in their general perimeter

448
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,120
configuration and we'll see a repeat of

449
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,060
the same type of breach that comes back

450
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,790
over and over and over again but you can

451
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,258
think about both those numbers that we

452
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,670
have in our data set basically just sort

453
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,170
of giving you sort of like an impact

454
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,759
distribution for the number of affected

455
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,479
assets that we see from different types

456
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,279
of activity and we also have some data

457
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,889
about what is going on on a breach so we

458
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,750
have demographics on things like what

459
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,339
lures are people actually using for

460
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,920
fishing over different time periods what

461
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,569
what our success rates of each you know

462
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,219
what malware is deployed if the Machine

463
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,110
actually does get popped and somebody

464
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,589
runs a dock on it so we have some some

465
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,050
data with that as well that we can share

466
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:12,779
so if I take a look at actually showing

467
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:16,290
the incident probability what we were

468
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,770
doing I'm gonna see here so this is

469
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,480
essentially the output of

470
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,610
statistical analysis has just been put

471
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,890
into a tool that we have up on our

472
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,230
website where you can take a look and

473
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,670
you can actually run some some different

474
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,410
filters over the data and you can say

475
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,740
well what does what does the rate of

476
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,170
breach look like for say you know all of

477
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,490
the different client pool or maybe just

478
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,110
like the client pool in the tech

479
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,860
industry or the health industry or the

480
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,270
insurance industry and then sort of

481
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,250
basically draw some comparisons around

482
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,990
that so if we take a look at it there is

483
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,480
is some interesting stuff that we can

484
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,000
actually see so this is just one view on

485
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,410
the data set we ran it as as two

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,960
different things one was instantaneous

487
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,270
because we were curious about what was

488
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,400
the like sort of the trend line so if we

489
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,050
see that there's a sudden spike in in

490
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,880
trending information then that can give

491
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,349
us an idea that maybe a particular type

492
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,160
of attack is starting to become more

493
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,050
successful and we can see that in

494
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,520
general for most of the incident types

495
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,490
on a global level over the last year

496
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,190
it's been you know fairly steady we can

497
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,170
we can also do sort of a analysis of

498
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,000
which types of incidents are more likely

499
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,520
than others to occur on any given month

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,730
so it looks like malware and phishing or

501
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,110
sort of you know going back and forth

502
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,420
we're seeing that the rate at which we

503
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,830
see malware incidents is a little bit

504
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,260
higher than the rate at which we see for

505
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,780
example general phishing but exploit

506
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,390
being seen on the inside of the firewall

507
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,710
because something is allowed and an

508
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,080
exploit attack to actually get through

509
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,870
is significantly higher than you know

510
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,889
either the other two and that is that is

511
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,540
a pattern that we generally see

512
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,270
consistently across most industries

513
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,409
there are a few exceptions one of the

514
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,820
things that was really interesting in

515
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,700
this data set was that when we compared

516
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,500
things like the UK dataset versus like

517
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,360
the North American dataset some of the

518
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,870
trends actually flipped around and

519
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,760
reversed so in the UK significantly more

520
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,419
likely to see phishing than it is to see

521
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,190
malware actually be successful but

522
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,980
there's that what we're doing here is

523
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,710
we're actually plotting an average case

524
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,150
a worst case in a best case and the way

525
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,440
that we're doing that within our dataset

526
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,420
is we're essentially just looking at the

527
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,620
confidence intervals so if we're

528
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,050
thinking back to that hyper geometric

529
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,870
distribution calculation it's going to

530
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,610
output output basically a upper bound a

531
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,179
lower bound and a confidence rate that

532
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,129
you can say

533
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,780
you're actually going to see that in the

534
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,190
general population based off of what you

535
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,570
observed so we're running a best case

536
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,610
projection would basically be the bottom

537
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,110
of that confidence interval and then the

538
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,949
worst case would be the top of that

539
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:51,100
confidence interval so with the tool

540
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,890
basically you can move around inside of

541
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,389
that data and sort of see what it is you

542
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,580
can compare a number of different

543
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,460
industries so for example maybe I wanted

544
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,070
to do a comparison and I may be a

545
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,990
finance client and I'm considering you

546
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,090
know partnering up with a insurance

547
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,640
client and I kind of want to see whether

548
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,889
my risk rates are about the same as

549
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,020
their risk rates in terms of general

550
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,550
health so we can take a look at this and

551
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,410
you know you can sort of compare what

552
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,639
those actually look like it's a little

553
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,900
chaotic if you look at all of them

554
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,720
together but maybe we just want to

555
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,690
compare the rate for say malware between

556
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,250
the two and you can see that you know

557
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,140
there's there's different rates that are

558
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,580
actually in here the other thing that

559
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,180
you can do with this which we thought

560
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,490
was interesting was with show cumulative

561
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:40,120
rates of breach for particular types of

562
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,470
incidents so we were looking at a month

563
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,360
over month and what we realized was that

564
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,670
the month over month rate is is actually

565
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,050
quite a low percentage most of the time

566
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,310
you're not going to see a breach that

567
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,680
actually shows up on the inside on a

568
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,000
monthly level but if we take a look at

569
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,490
that over the course of an entire year

570
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,810
your percentages start to change and

571
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,070
they also start to change if you start

572
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,649
to think about managing more and more

573
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,600
sites so I mean intuitively this this

574
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,010
definitely makes sense if you have lots

575
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,080
of different locations that you have to

576
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,640
protect and do you think about you know

577
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,320
running your defenses on your on your

578
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,060
regular cadence over the course of an

579
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,590
entire year what are the chances that

580
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,000
somebody screws up in one of those

581
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,639
locations and maybe you know miss

582
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,630
applies I don't know an update to the

583
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,760
signatures that are running on your

584
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,160
next-gen firewall well your your rates

585
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,480
actually change on that one so the

586
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,370
variables that you can input into the

587
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,660
tool you can see whether you're talking

588
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,439
about a cumulative case you can see

589
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,820
whether you're talking about an

590
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,840
instantaneous case if you're looking for

591
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,490
trend data and you can also configure

592
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,260
basically you know how many different

593
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,430
sites that you would like to be talking

594
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,430
about inside of the data set

595
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,020
the next section that we actually have

596
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,049
in the data and this is where I was

597
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:53,470
coming back to that impact data is we

598
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,970
can talk about how many actual assets

599
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,510
are impacted by various different types

600
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,880
of breaches over the course of a year or

601
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,559
any other particular time period this

602
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,940
this particular set is looking at your

603
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,980
lis impacted assets but you could just

604
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,750
as easily from the same data set do it

605
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,679
over a monthly or a quarterly basis or

606
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,710
whatever it is that you wanted to

607
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,030
actually project out and we can see that

608
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,860
there's there's there's definitely

609
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:19,270
different types of distributions that

610
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:21,159
are that are out there but what we're

611
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,139
basically seeing here is that we have a

612
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,540
cluster and there's sort of a long tail

613
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,850
distribution for most things where your

614
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,409
average organization that you know

615
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,939
experience is something bird we're

616
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,100
seeing like say exploits showing up on

617
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,260
the inside of the perimeter is probably

618
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,969
talking about 20 or fewer different

619
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,290
systems that are actually susceptible to

620
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,940
those exploits that are actually getting

621
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,740
through and then you can think about

622
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,370
people who are on the tail end of the

623
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,350
distribution curve who are in this case

624
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,199
looking at like 900 different machines

625
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,428
that are actually experiencing something

626
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,620
these are probably people with much

627
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,110
poorer configurations at the perimeter

628
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,729
right so this the sort of gives you a

629
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,350
band you know if you think about how

630
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,580
regularly you actually apply your patch

631
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,750
schedule if you think about how

632
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,000
regularly you are you know updating your

633
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,440
perimeter defenses to block out anything

634
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,299
that's known bad from actually reaching

635
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,669
servers and attempting exploits against

636
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:16,020
them it can give you an idea of sort of

637
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:16,020
what that distribution looks like

638
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:24,999
so see if I can do this without it again

639
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:30,469
incident demographics in this so I've

640
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:32,269
actually like so we have that like the

641
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:33,469
tool data I've also got it pulled up in

642
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,019
here and the reason why I wanted to do

643
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:38,179
this was because we can also think about

644
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,459
what sorts of different types of

645
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:43,369
exploits are there so the data set that

646
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,749
we're releasing today is is one where

647
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:46,369
you can take a look at what are all the

648
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,159
impact distributions for these types of

649
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:51,049
incidents we also have companion papers

650
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,489
for threat intelligence that are talking

651
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,440
about like what are the specific types

652
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:57,259
of things that we see those are done on

653
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,909
something where they're there I think

654
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,649
generally released on a quarterly basis

655
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:02,029
all of this data is really available to

656
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,139
everybody as a practitioner so if that's

657
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:04,899
something that you're interested in it's

658
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:07,789
it's not something you have to pay for

659
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,228
but we're breaking it down in terms of

660
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:10,459
what we're actually seeing in terms of

661
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,859
the campaign's that are actually getting

662
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:14,209
through and you know you see that there

663
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,789
are some things which are very popular

664
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:18,889
which are actually still you know coming

665
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,179
through onto the clean side in this

666
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:22,549
particular instance when we were running

667
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:24,229
this this is just again some some data

668
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:25,820
showing it's like we have like the

669
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:27,889
Microsoft I asked up in the WebLogic

670
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,928
stuff that's coming through fairly high

671
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:31,039
volume and then we have like a tail and

672
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,679
distribution of a lot of other different

673
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,879
types of exploits in a similar way we

674
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,989
can think about what are the different

675
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:38,119
types of things that people are actually

676
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:40,039
running on the machine when they

677
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,570
actually have access to it and we can

678
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,869
see that right now

679
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,039
Imhotep has been enormous leap all

680
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:47,418
popular for people to actually choose to

681
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,879
actually run on a machine once they

682
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,559
actually get access to it but we do see

683
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:54,199
a lot of other different types of tools

684
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,639
being run sort of and again that sort of

685
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,529
long tail distribution where you see

686
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,178
little bits of lots of different types

687
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:04,969
of activity that's coming through in

688
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:06,249
there fishing so I mean there's lots of

689
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:08,629
different data that you have on fishing

690
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:10,820
like realistically this is probably one

691
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:13,908
of the most popular ways to actually

692
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,589
breach in because you can successfully

693
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:18,739
get a user to do something stupid just

694
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:22,428
about all the time and it's an attack

695
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:23,479
that never really gets old but one of

696
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,669
the things that we were looking at here

697
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:27,319
is maybe we can talk about some some

698
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:28,320
data about when you know you can think

699
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,670
that you would have

700
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,620
likely for people to actually convert

701
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,520
over and engage with phishing and what

702
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,810
are different ways that we can actually

703
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,450
take a look at it so you can see that

704
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,649
there are some days of the week where

705
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,030
there's actually significantly less

706
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,440
chance that people will actually engage

707
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,580
with a phishing campaign and other days

708
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,710
of the week where there's you know

709
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,560
almost twice as high a percentage of

710
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,300
them engaging at the phishing campaign

711
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,340
so this looks at basically just link

712
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:54,780
clicked and credentials actually

713
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,090
submitted out of the phishing data we

714
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,540
can also think about like what lures we

715
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,370
actually see are being more effective so

716
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,110
you know what we see the most of in

717
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,090
terms of lures and then what we see are

718
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,560
most successful in terms of people

719
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,050
actually clicking and engaging with them

720
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,500
so again if this data is something that

721
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,700
is of interest to you there is a whole

722
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,750
bunch of additional stuff that we

723
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:21,780
actually have within there so ways to

724
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:25,440
use this run books next steps that kind

725
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,389
of stuff so really when we were putting

726
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,890
this together there's a couple of

727
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,570
different people that we were sort of

728
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,130
thinking about well one if you are

729
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,240
already well represented by one of the

730
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,970
convenience samples that we've

731
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,590
calculated for you please feel free to

732
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,170
use the work that we've actually

733
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:43,260
produced inside of here but otherwise we

734
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,960
have the raw data set and say you are

735
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,340
you know maybe a mix of like industry

736
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,780
and financial so you just want to see

737
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,300
like a mix of those two different data

738
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,129
sets blended together I'm hoping that

739
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,360
you can take the raw data that were that

740
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,980
we're putting out there you can blend

741
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,510
those together into a convenience sample

742
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,850
that sort of represents what it is that

743
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,530
you want to represent with it and sort

744
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:05,189
of repeat the methodology that we've

745
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,990
discussed here today in order to give

746
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,670
you some better predictions that you can

747
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,990
use for your own threat intelligence

748
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,790
purposes or again if you're trying to

749
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,740
justify in terms of like a management

750
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,970
decision like what your blue team you

751
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,680
know needs in order to actually do

752
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,340
something and then the impact data

753
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,720
obviously you're going to have to do a

754
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,149
self assessment of how flat your

755
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,410
environment is and how quickly you

756
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,300
actually respond to one of these things

757
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,500
when when you see something get popped

758
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,500
inside of your environment if you

759
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,360
respond relatively quickly and you

760
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,220
contain it fairly effectively or you

761
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,990
have like lots of great network

762
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,160
segmentation then you're probably going

763
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,960
to see something where

764
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,450
you have a fairly similar impact

765
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,900
distribution on on the left-hand side of

766
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:50,460
the curve if you're somebody who is in

767
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,440
the unfortunate position of having to do

768
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,600
security for a completely flat network

769
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,400
environment with no permissioning and

770
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,629
you know you know lease privileges and

771
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,460
none of that great stuff and you're

772
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,040
probably gonna see something towards the

773
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,540
extreme tail end where you know a lot of

774
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,030
assets are getting impacted but it's a

775
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,240
good way to actually show what that what

776
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:12,960
that range can actually look like so at

777
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,300
this point if anybody is interested in

778
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,820
the actual like data set in contact

779
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,370
that's the the link up there and then

780
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,169
the the QR code is just a repeat of the

781
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:26,459
link if you are interested in pulling it

782
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:28,410
down but without up there I just we have

783
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,790
a fairly small audience today does

784
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:33,710
anyone have any questions with anything

785
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,710
that I could go into or or explore

786
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:57,600
yeah so that's that's a good question so

787
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:59,158
if we're thinking about this the idea is

788
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,509
to try and give you an idea of sort of

789
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,950
what are the probabilities that you'll

790
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:03,899
you're run into different things so that

791
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,940
you can kind of prioritize what your

792
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:08,008
blue team activities should be if we're

793
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,090
thinking about a run book one of the

794
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:11,129
things that we can do is we can

795
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,658
basically detail out what are the

796
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:14,369
general investigative steps that you'd

797
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,259
have to take along the way at different

798
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:18,178
stages in order to actually respond to

799
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:22,889
one of these actually being detected so

800
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:25,859
if we think back to this fishing example

801
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:27,928
that we have here there's a number of

802
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,699
steps in here that we can think about

803
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,830
that you would have to do for basically

804
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,919
every every one of these detections

805
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,519
right so this is one we're basically

806
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,350
just looking at a block of a file block

807
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,639
download where somebody's attempting to

808
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,830
download from something that we've got a

809
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:45,389
reputation indicator for but if you

810
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,109
think about each of the steps that are

811
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:50,850
on here these are very highly automated

812
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:52,710
things that you can actually take a look

813
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,899
at doing repeatedly within your

814
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,299
organization so a lot of people are

815
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,758
starting to look at soar platforms in

816
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,950
order to start to automate these tasks

817
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,509
and increase the fidelity of the signal

818
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,009
that the analysts are actually having to

819
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,179
take a look at when they go in to do it

820
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,580
so they don't have to do so many of

821
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,879
these things by hand but we can think

822
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,580
about you know collecting the data about

823
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:17,248
you know what is it that this this

824
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,199
particular incident is actually having

825
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:21,239
so pull down data about the ip's pull

826
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,249
down data about the files all of the

827
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:25,230
steps in this are things that we can

828
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:27,960
think about doing in an automated all

829
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,210
sort of way so you could do a run book

830
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,859
where for example you were to take the

831
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,320
indicator you were to look at it you

832
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,139
were to you know maybe extract a peak

833
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,080
app around it maybe automatically submit

834
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:42,899
the files within for analysis inside of

835
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,309
your sandbox application and then maybe

836
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,840
the analyst at the other end instead of

837
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:47,999
having to repeat all of these steps is

838
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,590
just looking at a report where they can

839
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:51,929
see everything that's on and maybe they

840
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,439
can just move into a judgment sort of

841
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:54,440
situation

842
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:18,200
yes I I would a hundred percent agree

843
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,240
with doing that we often don't have a

844
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,120
dollar value to assign to the assets

845
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,740
that we're protecting so we're we're

846
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,050
outsourced so we're not in a position to

847
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,850
do that but if you're looking at it from

848
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,260
your side and you are like a

849
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,669
practitioner who's protecting just one

850
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,250
environment a hundred percent I would

851
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,470
definitely do that I would also take a

852
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,330
look at like when you're when you're

853
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,340
applying that sort of dollar value think

854
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,080
about the data that's on there and think

855
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,490
about the cost of remediation is two

856
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,870
other costs that you would plug in to

857
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,870
that for your impact assessment

858
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,149
yeah yeah yeah no I can it can

859
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:58,070
definitely skyrocket up there and in

860
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:58,070
some cases it can be almost nothing so

861
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:03,469
any others

862
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,469
okay

863
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:21,880
