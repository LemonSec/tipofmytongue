Ullman I will move around a bunch

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,560
because for one thing I know it's three

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,080
o'clock I know what happens to me at 3

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,759
o'clock in the afternoon even if I'm

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,439
really engaged and I really want to hear

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,890
what somebody has to say at 3 o'clock my

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,308
brain goes and I feel like a wind-up

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,840
doll

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,610
so I'm gonna move around and hopefully

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,570
that'll help keep everybody awake I also

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,000
am hoping to engage you guys and and not

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,320
just be the only one talking so if you

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,739
think you're gonna just sit quietly I

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,710
kind of hope you don't so here's the

18
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,659
agenda for today we're gonna you're

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,820
gonna meet the sloth you'll see what

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,890
that means we're gonna talk about the

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,600
motivation why this is such an important

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,670
topic we're going to talk about some

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,190
strengths and weaknesses in information

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,220
security and by InfoSec I literally mean

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,869
a very broad spectrum of thing right so

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,479
not just people who blue team not just

27
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,979
people who red team but everybody who

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,960
works in this industry we're gonna see

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,830
some strengths and weaknesses and then

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,720
we're going to talk about the

31
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,550
communications on multiple levels within

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,260
an organization because I think that's a

33
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,759
really important topic and we'll see why

34
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,580
we're also going to talk about non

35
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,560
verbals we talk sometimes there is

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,510
conversation about communication and we

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,890
talk a lot about the right kinds of

38
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,050
things to say but what about the things

39
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,780
you're not saying so we're gonna talk

40
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,060
about that too and then I've got some

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,770
final thoughts as we go along if you

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,320
have questions please feel free to jump

43
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,800
in and ask I love to hear what you have

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,059
to say so with that here's the sloth

45
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,039
this sloths name is Minnie

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,650
she was my adopted sloth at the Buffalo

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,470
zoo up until a few years ago and I'm a

48
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,680
huge fan of sloths so I often put this

49
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,140
as the slide of me but really this is me

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,030
okay I have been at the University of

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,940
Buffalo a very very long time I started

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,519
in on the support side of things and

53
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,619
over time moved into security I have

54
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:12,840
some degrees I have some certifications

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,739
I know a few things but I don't know

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,569
everything

57
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,270
in fact I come to these things to learn

58
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,569
just as much as anybody else so please

59
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,069
feel free if you hear me talk

60
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,988
something and you think it should be

61
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,548
corrected I'm very open to hearing what

62
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:31,700
you have to say so why is this topic

63
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:34,239
important you should probably care about

64
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,450
this because what are the odds of being

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,060
impacted by some kind of nasty breach

66
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,700
they're pretty good right I mean if we

67
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,489
look at these numbers alone we can see

68
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,619
that the breaches themselves started

69
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,459
going up then they started going down

70
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,889
but so this sort of seems like maybe

71
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:58,549
this is a good thing right only 281

72
00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:03,790
breaches through April but look at the

73
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:07,159
record numbers that that's not so good

74
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,429
so how many of you deal with Incident

75
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,980
Response on a regular basis least a few

76
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,169
of you okay so this is kind of your

77
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,459
world right you're dealing with breaches

78
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,620
and you're dealing with unpleasant stuff

79
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,260
how many of you are on the other side of

80
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,620
the house either trying to break into

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,978
stuff or you know ideally for money but

82
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:33,290
maybe sometimes not at least a couple

83
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:38,290
okay what are the rest of you do read

84
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:41,150
the news okay fair anything else

85
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:46,370
communications yeah okay important stuff

86
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:49,959
anybody else tools do you write them or

87
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:56,509
do you you maintain them okay excellent

88
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:59,060
what else anybody else wanna yeah change

89
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:01,129
management okay so you'll find that this

90
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,720
is this is fairly relevant to all of you

91
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:04,459
it's going to touch all of you in very

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,049
different ways depending on the role

93
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,900
that you play within your organization

94
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:12,370
but the odds are pretty good regardless

95
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:17,120
because look at last year alone right

96
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,918
two to three billion records ish and if

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,490
you look at this little bottom bullet

98
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,840
here so that's one point six eight

99
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,020
billion non-sensitive

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,609
on top of the sensitive stuff so what do

101
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,870
we think of as sensitive well credit

102
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,040
cards right passport numbers social

103
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,710
security numbers that's all

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:44,390
sensitive data what about the stuff that

105
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:47,560
seems non sensitive does that matter who

106
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,560
said yes why

107
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,890
okay but that could be considered

108
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,539
sensitive potentially for the company

109
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:14,289
what about others less interesting stuff

110
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:15,700
go ahead right yeah so the data that's

111
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,190
out there things like who brings the

112
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,960
donuts to the office if that person

113
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,460
doesn't come in that day they're out

114
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,409
sick and you find out they're out sick

115
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,900
and you want to say get into that

116
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,790
company maybe your so and so's friend

117
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,979
and you're bringing in the donuts right

118
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,890
so just because data appears to be

119
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,170
sensitive in nature doesn't necessarily

120
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,789
mean that or I'm sorry that he's not

121
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,160
sensitive in nature doesn't necessarily

122
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,230
mean that it doesn't matter in many

123
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,700
cases if you take that non sensitive

124
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,440
data and you pull enough of it together

125
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,450
you can correlate some really

126
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,500
interesting things about a company that

127
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:53,500
maybe they don't want you to know so

128
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,450
this is a pretty famous quote obviously

129
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,850
this guy's been in the news a lot and no

130
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,409
matter what you think about him

131
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,420
personally or professionally I think his

132
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,750
statement is pretty accurate that

133
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,860
basically companies either a breach or

134
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,600
they're going to be breached or they're

135
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,540
going to be breached again because

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,770
that's just the nature of this business

137
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,090
so let's talk a little bit about our

138
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:18,880
strengths and weaknesses

139
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:22,419
what are we particularly good at well

140
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,400
first of all consider this consider that

141
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,660
this is not necessarily just a

142
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,799
technological problem and again whether

143
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,810
or not you like this particular

144
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,430
individual I think what he has to say is

145
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:41,140
interesting I think this quote merits

146
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:44,320
some thought right if you think that

147
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,479
technology is the be-all end-all to your

148
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,700
security problems that you may not

149
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,920
understand that problem because as we're

150
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,800
seeing human beings play a bigger and

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,060
bigger role in all of this right so keep

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,590
that in mind and that's where this

153
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,600
communication part is gonna be really

154
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,500
critical so this is what we're really

155
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:06,670
good at doing we fix stuff we break

156
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:10,000
stuff we deal with the technology stuff

157
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:16,180
right this is what we do this is what

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,800
we're not so good at yeah

159
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,120
we're not so good at the human Inge

160
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,820
we're pretty good at the computing stuff

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,460
how often do you find yourself if you're

162
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,599
ever in a support type role thinking oh

163
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,460
my goodness they're so dumb Oh

164
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,930
does anybody think that who's in a super

165
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,289
role at all do you ever think those

166
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,810
things yeah right and and you know I can

167
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:44,110
attest to this right I too have been

168
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,080
there it gets very frustrating but the

169
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,560
reality is if you're talking about let's

170
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,500
say a CFO right or you're talking about

171
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,910
a marketing manager is it their job to

172
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:04,000
know what you know about computing

173
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:07,120
what's their job whatever their job is

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,920
right so if it's the the CFO they better

175
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,390
know finances if they're marketing they

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,460
better know the marketing stuff I mean

177
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,669
that's what they're paid to know you're

178
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,739
paid to know technology and so just as

179
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,330
we get frustrated with them because they

180
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,150
don't necessarily understand the stuff

181
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,590
we understand I guarantee you if you try

182
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,200
to have a conversation with them about

183
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,020
what they know they will be equally as

184
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,830
frustrated and that's kind of important

185
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:36,329
to understand how about patience when

186
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:40,479
we're in those situations are we patient

187
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,750
yes we're so patient right the

188
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,220
impatience it thrives it's really easy

189
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,890
to lose your patience when you're like

190
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,380
for the 27th time just click the icon

191
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,910
and they're going what icon I don't know

192
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,320
what you're talking about how many

193
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,949
people do phone support for their

194
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,080
parents or other relatives right been

195
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,930
there done that I am incredibly

196
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,490
fortunate because the reason that I work

197
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,290
in this industry is that my father was

198
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,300
director of computing services at the

199
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,040
college where I grew up and so I've had

200
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,319
this stuff in my house my entire life

201
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,810
and he is not somebody I have to do

202
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,120
technical support for yay

203
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,250
my mother lives in Atlanta and my

204
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,510
brother is the one closest to her also

205
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,100
not my problem but I

206
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,140
do you get the phone call occasionally

207
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,690
from my uncle who is the lawyer who says

208
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,670
can you help me with this and since my

209
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,360
first divorce he helped me for free

210
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:34,550
hoping I will never have a second one I

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,870
give in and I give him some help so one

212
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,640
of the repercussions while there are a

213
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,400
lot of them

214
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,710
you're gonna lose trust if you're not

215
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,660
patient with people and you lose your

216
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,420
temper and it's very easy to think

217
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,640
negative things about these folks you're

218
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,560
going to start creating this negative

219
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,140
atmosphere even if you're not

220
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,500
necessarily actually saying things out

221
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,410
loud the thoughts in your own mind are

222
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,160
pervasive and they're going to affect

223
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,469
what you do because those thoughts start

224
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,290
to create beliefs and those beliefs

225
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,540
continue to affect thoughts and those

226
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,270
thoughts and beliefs ultimately affect

227
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,880
actions so the more frustrated you get

228
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,240
and the more you feed that onto yourself

229
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,530
the worse you're gonna find so you could

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,380
find that you're gonna have additional

231
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,530
conflict you're going to have a negative

232
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,640
potential reputation problem if you you

233
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,449
know can't work things out with people

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,430
you could have a decrease in morale

235
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,840
because people just get so frustrated I

236
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,150
didn't have a chance to add this in but

237
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,340
I actually have a friend who was ranting

238
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,890
on Facebook about her IT department and

239
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,170
I I asked her I said you know can I use

240
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,240
this for future presentations absolutely

241
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,339
she was very frustrated because the guy

242
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,080
that she was working with would not come

243
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,460
up and see what the problem was she kept

244
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,150
trying to describe it but she was having

245
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:59,540
a really difficult time explaining what

246
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,850
it was that she was seeing that she it

247
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,579
didn't make any sense to her and instead

248
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,470
of him saying okay I'm gonna come up

249
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,210
with I'm gonna take a look or you know

250
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,670
connecting in and looking at her machine

251
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:14,330
and trying to be patient with her he was

252
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,339
he just refused and so she just had

253
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,220
nothing good to say about her IT she's

254
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,500
like this is why I hate et I can't blame

255
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,210
her causes lots of elevated stress

256
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,460
causes stress for you causes stress for

257
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,740
the person you're trying to help all

258
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,270
right so now the part you've been

259
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,950
waiting for all right there's been an

260
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,199
intrusion there's been an infection

261
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,550
there's been some of this anybody seen

262
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,240
the

263
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,589
I mean most people have seen this in the

264
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,030
news even if they haven't seen it on a

265
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,710
machine I've seen it on at least a

266
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,930
handful of machines at the University

267
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,820
the very first time a department called

268
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,370
me and said hey we have this what do we

269
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,220
do I really really had to turn out to

270
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:54,070
laugh and say do you have any backups

271
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,230
and she said no and I said then I'm very

272
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,790
sorry any data on that machine you can

273
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,290
kiss goodbye there's nothing we can do

274
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,670
to help you and they were like but your

275
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,040
security you're supposed to be able to

276
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,930
help us then I said I'm sorry you know

277
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,140
that this is what this does to these

278
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,449
machines and I had to be very patient

279
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,040
and very calm with her and you know

280
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,810
let's see what where we can get maybe

281
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,500
some of this data from elsewhere but

282
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,260
there was nothing I could do to help her

283
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,470
now what right now we're in a bad

284
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,470
situation

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,820
we are the cats walking away from the

286
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,550
explosion except we can't walk away from

287
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,140
the explosion

288
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,680
okay panic we're gonna panic we're gonna

289
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,660
freak out

290
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,849
this is really tempting just flipping

291
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,819
out oh no what are we gonna do not

292
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,100
really productive this is not really

293
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
what you're supposed to do right you

294
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,710
especially if you're doing something

295
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,870
like it Incident Response this is kind

296
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,460
of the opposite of the attitude they

297
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,580
want you to have because if you freaked

298
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:55,510
out at every incident I don't think

299
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,510
you'd last long so instead we're gonna

300
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,100
talk to people and no matter what your

301
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,480
role is within your organization I

302
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,280
guarantee you're gonna be talking about

303
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,950
any incident that happens in your

304
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,660
organization whether you're part of the

305
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,450
Incident Response process you're just a

306
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,069
user in that environment you're you know

307
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,180
helping with software and environment

308
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,160
you're doing communicate it doesn't

309
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,910
matter you're gonna play some role in

310
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,010
that so this is supposed to be kind of

311
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,719
generic to we're going to talk about

312
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,880
three levels within your organization

313
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,070
and not all of this may apply to each

314
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,900
and every one of you every time but you

315
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,730
will find that there are pieces of this

316
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,000
that I would be surprised if it didn't

317
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,770
apply to all of you at some point so

318
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,230
here are your audience's we're gonna do

319
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,610
what's called frame the conversation so

320
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,440
these are the three levels that I was

321
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,440
talking about the end-user mid manager

322
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,970
in sea level and the first thing is you

323
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,300
need to try to anticipate what these do

324
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,610
levels are gonna ask because you're not

325
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,920
going to know for sure but based on kind

326
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,110
of what they do and and their role

327
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,269
within the organization you might be

328
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,829
able to kind of guess some of this stuff

329
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,759
because the more you can have prepared

330
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:06,649
to answer the better off you're gonna be

331
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,300
so how are you going to communicate this

332
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:12,319
information to them

333
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,050
consider the channel if somebody's

334
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,699
gotten into your network is it really a

335
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,120
good idea to be sending an email out

336
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:24,920
about that because what are the odds the

337
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,779
bad guys watching I wouldn't want to do

338
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,209
that right so maybe email in that

339
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,639
particular instance isn't your a good

340
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:33,920
channel maybe a company-wide meeting

341
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,420
isn't appropriate because maybe you

342
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,449
don't want the whole company to know all

343
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,040
of the details but it might be so each

344
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:42,859
one of these channels you have to

345
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,529
consider what's going on this is all

346
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,540
going to be context driven so depending

347
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,569
on the context of the situation and your

348
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,509
company and your environment that's

349
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:55,459
gonna drive a lot of this my favorite of

350
00:14:53,509 --> 00:15:00,199
course is you might want to use lawyer

351
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:06,589
approved carrier pigeons so your end

352
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:09,500
user right cute okay so your end user

353
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:12,199
they're typically focused on what they

354
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,670
need to get done during the day that's

355
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:15,559
their focus they want to make sure they

356
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,250
can get their job done anything that

357
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:21,319
impacts that is going to be problematic

358
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,050
if you can communicate both the what and

359
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:26,180
the why it doesn't mean you have to tell

360
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,699
them every single detail and I guarantee

361
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,439
they don't want to know because the

362
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:32,508
level of technical detail that most of

363
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:34,849
you will understand is so far above

364
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:37,250
where they are they don't want that

365
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,730
level of information they want to

366
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:45,709
understand the what happened and why at

367
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:48,350
their level in a way that makes sense to

368
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:50,359
them and that doesn't mean talking down

369
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,009
to them which is when we get impatient

370
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,069
the thing that most of us want to try to

371
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:56,720
do in some cases you want to try to use

372
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,459
this as an opportunity for awareness

373
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,860
training so in the case of ransomware

374
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,060
it's frequently somebody clicks on

375
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,970
something they probably shouldn't have

376
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,589
and now a machine gets infected or in

377
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,269
the case of like I said the first

378
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,370
instance we had of this it was an entire

379
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,690
departmental Drive alright so this is

380
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,540
not ideal now we have a whole department

381
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,310
that's down pointing fingers at this

382
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,519
point not helpful

383
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,310
not even remotely that doesn't mean that

384
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,380
we don't want to figure out who started

385
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,260
this and talk to them and educate them

386
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,510
again this is an opportunity for

387
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,060
awareness training so even for the

388
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,939
people who didn't do it we still want to

389
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,579
educate them on this is how it happened

390
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:40,110
and but not necessarily say well Johnny

391
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:43,149
did this and Sally did that no more like

392
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,610
this is probably what happened this

393
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,470
thing got infected this is how it

394
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,279
happened and this is what you can take

395
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,190
away from this

396
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,450
so takeaways for their level so we're

397
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,640
going to talk about effective and

398
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,339
efficient communications and what that

399
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,730
entails and it should be continuous we

400
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,290
tend to blast messages out and then stop

401
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:07,329
how many of you have ever gotten a

402
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,099
message an email let's see a forum

403
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,770
thread anything about a topic you were

404
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,928
super interested in and you heard like

405
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,369
you got like lots of information in the

406
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,799
very beginning you hear like I don't

407
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,829
know five or six different threads or

408
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:23,829
emails and all of a sudden nothing is

409
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,688
that frustrating I find that incredibly

410
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,938
frustrating and I guarantee your end

411
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,470
users are gonna be like oh my god we

412
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,559
talked all about lives like this huge

413
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,760
thing and all that was just gone and

414
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,950
then you feel like you're in the dark

415
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,169
maybe they're purposely not telling you

416
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:42,820
something this really is not a good idea

417
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,370
so how does one effectively and

418
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,439
efficiently communicate well you're

419
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,340
gonna be precise and you're gonna be

420
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,679
concise

421
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,449
keep it short like I said they don't

422
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,270
need to know every single detail in this

423
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,160
case that's not important they need to

424
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,740
know what's relevant to them be

425
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,720
judicious so again if Sally is the one

426
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,520
who clicked on the link and caused the

427
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,280
problem they don't need to know that

428
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,650
Sally did that that's not necessarily

429
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,178
important what's important is that there

430
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,490
was somebody who clicked on something

431
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,880
this is the outcome and now this is how

432
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,500
it's going

433
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,780
impact you for the next however long

434
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,060
it's gonna impact you those are the more

435
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,740
important things and be patient oh my

436
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,889
goodness if you have to go to a closet

437
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,460
and scream your head off after you're

438
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,410
done

439
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,190
scream your head off nothing wrong with

440
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,270
that then come back in deep breaths

441
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:35,350
meditating you know

442
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:37,810
inhaling whatever it is you need but try

443
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,189
really hard to be patient because people

444
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,870
are usually freaking out at this point

445
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:46,180
at every level so this is what I've been

446
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,610
alluding to multiple times you need to

447
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:52,510
talk to people in a way that they can

448
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:56,350
understand on their level so if it's

449
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:58,330
something that they can relate to so if

450
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:02,530
you have to tell them a story tell them

451
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,060
a story stories go a long way this is

452
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,670
how we don't want to communicate with

453
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:13,389
end users or frankly anybody else this

454
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:14,530
goes badly so engagement is key you're

455
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,880
gonna want to stay engaged with them

456
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,010
like I said you don't want to just drop

457
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,450
the ball you want to make sure that all

458
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,010
of the things that you're telling them

459
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,520
that you sort of follow through to the

460
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,260
end

461
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,940
so when things are restored and back up

462
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,290
to normal or you've rebuilt or whatever

463
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,080
it is that you've had to do with the new

464
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,960
organization let them know we've we've

465
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,490
recovered from this here's where we are

466
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,930
you know something so that they don't

467
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,180
feel like they were left hanging and in

468
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,010
the dark because otherwise you're going

469
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,010
to breed some discomfort and when you

470
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,600
breed discomfort you get fear and fear

471
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,970
is not good in this business I have a

472
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,580
whole other talk about that that I'll be

473
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,890
giving at Circle City con so this whole

474
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,639
idea of addressing potential fear

475
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,810
uncertainty and doubt anticipate that

476
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,330
you're gonna have people who are

477
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,490
terrified both the person who probably

478
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,770
did the action is terrified because of

479
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,540
the ramifications of that but even the

480
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,860
people who didn't you know they they

481
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,210
don't know they don't understand

482
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,679
necessarily what's going on

483
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,770
so anticipate there's going to be a

484
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,140
certain level of that fear and honestly

485
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:17,260
perception for for these folks that's

486
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,440
reality it doesn't matter if we all know

487
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,180
yeah this is how this really worked

488
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,530
their perception is their reality so you

489
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,290
have to find a way to deal with that

490
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,960
even if you know the their perceptions

491
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,690
way off you're gonna have to find a way

492
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,400
to explain to them that I understand

493
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,240
this is what you observed and I

494
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,960
understand you're very uncomfortable

495
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,240
about that so you know how can I help

496
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,770
and sometimes they'll be able to tell

497
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,000
you well just explain this to me

498
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:48,670
oh all right even if you know

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,490
something's not a problem dude you know

500
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,290
listen give it a best effort to

501
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,860
investigate it so that it doesn't seem

502
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:59,440
like you're blowing them off all right

503
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:04,179
mid-level management so we have our mid

504
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,350
managers every calm down so they're

505
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,330
usually focused on your business

506
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,030
processes and that's going to depend

507
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,290
greatly on what they're a manager of so

508
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,629
we talked about the difference between

509
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,870
you know a marketing person and a

510
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,790
finance person in an HR person all of

511
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,620
that even I teach right it's all gonna

512
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,820
be different

513
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,110
you're gonna again you're gonna speak at

514
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,290
a level they can understand and relate

515
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,909
to and they're probably not going to

516
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,950
know a whole lot more about IT unless

517
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,410
they're an IT manager than your end

518
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,390
users so you may be telling them in some

519
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:38,290
cases the same sorts of things you're

520
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,940
telling your end users you're gonna use

521
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,520
that effective and efficient

522
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,370
communications again and you're not

523
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,050
going to do this oh no it's the end of

524
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,179
the world bad thing happened chicken

525
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,120
with my head cut off and you're not

526
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,100
going to give them no useful information

527
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,860
in the same way that you're going to

528
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,409
help your end user to understand what's

529
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,090
happened how it why it happened and how

530
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,960
it happened you're gonna do that same

531
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:07,590
thing for mid-level management so this

532
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,890
is a skill set for an ideal manager

533
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,720
pretty good list right good delegation

534
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,110
skills pretty good at interpersonal

535
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,390
stuff they can communicate communicate

536
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,280
well they can negotiate stuff they have

537
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,800
high level of emotional intelligence and

538
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,750
they can be pretty good influencers who

539
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,139
here has ever met a middle manager that

540
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,450
meets those qualifications oh look at

541
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,840
all those hands one hand so you've met

542
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,220
one of these that's impressive

543
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,699
usually I don't get any hands because

544
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,700
usually

545
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,149
this is where we would find the middle

546
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:46,279
manager so what makes you this manager

547
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:48,408
for you so fabulous that they really

548
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:53,440
have all that skill set did they just

549
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:53,440
have a wide background yeah

550
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:58,759
which can go either way right I mean

551
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:00,049
because you can have some of those

552
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,899
skills or you can have all of those

553
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:05,840
skills but with the military background

554
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:08,178
sometimes they are very rigid in their

555
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,059
thinking so that can go either way

556
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:14,200
but this is often what I find with the

557
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:16,849
whole idea of an ideal mid-level manager

558
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,190
so we've got to engage with the regular

559
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:21,049
ones since most of most of us aren't so

560
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:25,220
lucky is to have an ideal mid-level

561
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:28,129
manager in our midst we need to support

562
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,759
these folks this is our job no matter

563
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:33,728
what it is you do be kind to them

564
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:36,320
everybody below a mid-level manager

565
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:38,269
wants to be where they are they want to

566
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,340
move up and everybody who's above them

567
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,979
is trying to keep them down it is a

568
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,519
crappy place to be even if they love

569
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:47,599
what they do

570
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,369
it's still it's stressful if there's a

571
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:54,200
reason why they're that mid-level

572
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:56,570
manager right so empathy is key you need

573
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,249
to be empathetic you need to realize

574
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,799
that they are they are being pulled in

575
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:04,210
multiple directions so what can we do

576
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,710
for them we can make them look good

577
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,679
so you're going to work with mid-level

578
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,929
managers in many cases and you're going

579
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,210
to develop a plan for their units and

580
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,879
the plan needs to include a lot of these

581
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,159
things it needs to include all your

582
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:21,830
stakeholders of course what happened

583
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,919
exactly what your timeframe recovery

584
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,689
options are like you know is this gonna

585
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,059
happen again is it likely to happen

586
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,269
anytime soon and what's your end goal

587
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,979
and how are you gonna get there so if

588
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,659
you're doing Incident Response the last

589
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,950
thing you want to do is show up and with

590
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:39,710
the chicken with the head cut off thing

591
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,899
and go oh no sky is falling bad thing

592
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,909
happened know you want to show up and

593
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:46,399
you want to say the bad thing happened

594
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:48,259
here's what it was and here's our game

595
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,658
plan and you're gonna work with them to

596
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:52,550
figure this out you're not gonna just

597
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,440
show up with everything

598
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,940
you know pre-connected in your brain

599
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,130
because you don't know everything they

600
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,620
know but you need to realize all these

601
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,270
pieces have to be in place so you could

602
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:07,219
help them look good right that's kind of

603
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:09,170
this whole idea that I before now going

604
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,320
back to when I said we don't want to

605
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,360
blame people this is true publicly we do

606
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,370
not want to blame the folks who make the

607
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,120
mistakes this doesn't buy anybody

608
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,639
anything

609
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,459
however management do need to take

610
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,560
responsibility for their people so the

611
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,710
reality is if a manager has somebody

612
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,690
who's a problem child they need to help

613
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,050
figure out the best way to handle that

614
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,250
there is no 100% guarantee that you're

615
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,710
going to be able to mitigate every

616
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,840
single risk for every user out there but

617
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,630
there are ways when you have somebody

618
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,669
who just always clicks the thing to

619
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,220
minimize the potential impact on the

620
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,350
rest of a company and they need to know

621
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:53,060
who those people are and in some cases

622
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,040
this is how they find out right so these

623
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,610
are some questions that you should be

624
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,200
considering if you are doing IR ransom

625
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,540
payments I can't tell you how many

626
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,160
people I've talked to that have not had

627
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,270
this conversation within their companies

628
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:12,410
so what happens if they get something

629
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,940
that you absolutely have to have or

630
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,820
you've done your backups and you go to

631
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,470
do the restore and it's just gone

632
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,870
have you had the conversation about are

633
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,960
you willing to do this because there's a

634
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,370
lot of detail involved who's paying how

635
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,470
are they paying how is this going to

636
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,479
play out or straight up we're just not

637
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,980
paying and we're willing to just say we

638
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,420
don't have this data anymore and of

639
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,610
course there's no guarantee even if you

640
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:38,080
pay you're gonna get this data back

641
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,459
right but the reality is that

642
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
conversation should not be happening the

643
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,390
day that you're in the middle of an

644
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,679
incident because it's too late then I

645
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,700
mean not that you can't have that

646
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,810
conversation but that's problematic so

647
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,700
you also want to talk about talk with

648
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,409
them about whether they should be

649
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,380
delegating are they gonna play the role

650
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:04,640
of a coach how is how are they going to

651
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,930
fit into this bigger picture so your

652
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,420
c-suite

653
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,040
think about 30 seconds on an elevator

654
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,630
because that's about the amount of time

655
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,899
they're usually going to give you and

656
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,580
even if they give you more the important

657
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,700
things you have to say to them should

658
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,620
fit within this 30 seconds which doesn't

659
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,290
mean you fly through them it means again

660
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,909
being very concise they're going to look

661
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,379
at this big picture they're gonna look

662
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,270
at you know the whole company

663
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,680
performance these are the the vision

664
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,480
these are the things they're really

665
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,940
focused on they don't care about

666
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,550
day-to-day details typically they're so

667
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,580
far removed from that they it's just not

668
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,800
important to them so again you need to

669
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,689
frame this conversation so that it's

670
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,810
interesting for them and and something

671
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,580
worthwhile again non technical

672
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,909
descriptions unless you're talking to a

673
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,530
CIO who happens to be super technical I

674
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:57,920
can tell you that our CIO is not super

675
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:00,440
technical he's just not does he have

676
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,030
some technique background yeah so if you

677
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,010
say the word router he doesn't look at

678
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,180
you like you have four heads but I'll

679
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,190
tell you right now that he wouldn't

680
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,070
understand an incident if we had any

681
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,560
sort of major and said he wouldn't know

682
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,500
so you're still in many ways talking

683
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,690
like you would with the end user except

684
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,580
instead of focusing on the day-to-day

685
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,490
stuff you're gonna look at this bigger

686
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,470
picture he's gonna he or she is going to

687
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,390
want to know best case worst case

688
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,570
scenario type stuff because again this

689
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,280
is the big picture and you know

690
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:36,919
consequences are we likely to see this

691
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:39,200
again no geek speek there's gonna be

692
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,960
just about nobody at your c-level now

693
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm I say just about because I do know

694
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,710
that there are companies that sometimes

695
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,300
have c-suite folk who are very technical

696
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,460
and very competent and that's awesome

697
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,680
but by and large your C suite doesn't

698
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,910
know technology and so if you walk in

699
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,100
there and you start talking about

700
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,810
various ransomware they may not even

701
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,129
know what ransomware is despite the fact

702
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,080
that it's been in the news and people

703
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,460
use this lingual every day I can't tell

704
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,990
you many people I've used the word

705
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,060
malware and they look at me and they're

706
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,830
like I don't know what that is so then I

707
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,530
have to explain to them all just mal

708
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,120
think make you think of good or bad and

709
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:14,990
then usually I sort of walk them through

710
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,959
oh yeah okay bad okay so it you know

711
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,370
some bad software on the system and it

712
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,590
does bad thing

713
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:24,739
and depending on the level of person I

714
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,000
can get more or less technical but they

715
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,700
don't necessarily even know if they've

716
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,360
heard the words they may not understand

717
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,970
what you're talking about

718
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,030
so using that plain English is important

719
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,190
do your homework understand if you're if

720
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,480
you're part of the company by all means

721
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,950
you should be researching and

722
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,500
understanding the goals of your company

723
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:46,520
don't be a silo if you're going in as a

724
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,780
as a third party contractor you really

725
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,309
want to do your homework so that you

726
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,070
understand what's important to that

727
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:53,379
c-suite you know their what is the goal

728
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:56,000
of the company what have they been doing

729
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,799
you should be doing that before meeting

730
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,110
with them that's why you only get that

731
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,490
30-second elevator give them this little

732
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,309
bit of information that they need to

733
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,200
understand you're going to enter an exit

734
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:07,908
gracefully no matter how frustrated you

735
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,250
are you're not going to blow up at them

736
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:14,480
you're not going to get frustrated with

737
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:17,990
them at least not visually and remember

738
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,450
ultimately these are people - I know

739
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,909
that some people see the c-suite as so

740
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,190
high up that they forget that they

741
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:26,900
usually have a family and kids and

742
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,429
people they go home - not all of them

743
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,330
but some your CFO they're gonna be

744
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,780
interested in numbers and metrics

745
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:38,270
they're gonna be all about the money

746
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:40,639
they often know a lot of legal stuff use

747
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,789
their knowledge to your benefit work

748
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:48,049
with them because if they know some laws

749
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:53,990
or you know the the the different kinds

750
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:56,629
of rules that govern your particular

751
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,860
business that can impact greatly how

752
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,429
you're going to go forward with this

753
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,990
right so your CEO oh there's different

754
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:05,179
kinds of CEOs so there's some

755
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:09,049
considerations here about you know which

756
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:11,059
kind of CEO you're talking to again this

757
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:14,510
whole idea of framing the conversation I

758
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:18,230
won't spend a lot of time here all right

759
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:20,450
now how do we know if what we've told

760
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:26,450
them them meaning any one of these

761
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:31,870
levels gets through right

762
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:35,270
it's tough to tell one way is by

763
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,139
nonverbal communication so the first

764
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,300
thing we're going to do is we're gonna

765
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:42,350
pay attention to body language body

766
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,629
language is critical by the language

767
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,959
includes a lot of things these are the

768
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:51,230
sort of typical things so your your your

769
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,170
gesture your posture whether you're

770
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:56,090
making eye contact how you shake hands

771
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,100
breathing there are a lot of different

772
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:01,070
factors I'm keeping this very brief

773
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,350
there I could go into this in great

774
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,389
detail the folks who do social

775
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,149
engineering pay really close attention

776
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:12,350
to this stuff and it's really useful in

777
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:15,140
just about every level of the field so

778
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,719
there are non-verbal cues these are

779
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:21,620
pretty standard examples so raised

780
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,000
eyebrows right so with any one of these

781
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,360
nonverbal cues

782
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,220
you can interpret them differently so if

783
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,610
I raise my eyebrows am i surprised about

784
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,630
something or am i doubting what you're

785
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,639
telling me it could go either way right

786
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,950
kind of depends and we see that for a

787
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,830
lot of these other gestures if I'm

788
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,690
sitting like this am i sitting like this

789
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,270
because it's freaking cold in the room

790
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,390
or am i sitting like this because I'm

791
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,860
not listening to a word you say and the

792
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,980
point of this is that we can't look at

793
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,590
any one of these and go oh I understand

794
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,050
the picture now we have to take them all

795
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,959
together so we have to do what's called

796
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:06,919
synthesize these verbal cues so this is

797
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,080
just one example so reading a person if

798
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,600
you take raised eyebrows and maybe

799
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,840
fleeting eye movement maybe a you know

800
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,240
real hard grip on something they're

801
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,850
probably uncomfortable so you need to

802
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,460
look at all of these nonverbal cues as a

803
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,110
collective you can't take any one of

804
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,880
these individually and it's still

805
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,459
possible to misinterpret what you're

806
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,950
seeing but pay attention because people

807
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:35,900
will tell you more than you realize by

808
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:38,000
not saying word so with some final

809
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:42,630
thoughts

810
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,480
our job in IT and I don't care whether

811
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,910
you're in security whether you're in

812
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,740
InfoSec whether you're a hacker

813
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,100
whether you're Red Team whether you're

814
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:56,850
blue team however it is you define your

815
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,620
role in this industry our job is to

816
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:01,830
educate because we're the ones who

817
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,560
understand this stuff and they're not as

818
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:08,100
I started out in the beginning these

819
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:11,219
folks know what they know you know what

820
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,290
you know share that information because

821
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,379
without it they'll never know

822
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:17,969
and find opportunities to share that

823
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,430
information I was able to share

824
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:23,399
information I had a colleague another

825
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,580
colleague with a Facebook post who tried

826
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,920
to say she was very frustrated because

827
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,290
somebody had sent her an email that had

828
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,290
an attachment that had a password on the

829
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:38,040
attachment and it was redundant security

830
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,820
and I said instead of saying oh my god

831
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,020
you're so stupid

832
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,390
what do you mean I thought huh I want to

833
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,280
know more about this and so public

834
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,750
Facebook I just asked her I said tell me

835
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,350
more I want to understand why do you

836
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:54,239
feel that this is redundant tell me and

837
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:56,190
so she explained this whole thing about

838
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,620
you know the email and the password

839
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:01,620
protected document and that jeez she had

840
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,120
to log into her email so I then had the

841
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,770
opportunity to explain to her that by

842
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,600
default email is not secure there's

843
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,120
nothing secure about email by to fall

844
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,200
so yes you log into your mailbox and

845
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,819
that gives you access to your mailbox

846
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,919
but when you're sending a message that

847
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,080
message could be interpreted through

848
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,630
other systems it bounces between

849
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,400
machines there's often no protection

850
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:24,030
whatsoever and she was shocked she had

851
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,640
no idea again I know what I know and she

852
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,320
doesn't so once I explained it to her

853
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,850
she realized oh this isn't redundant at

854
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,910
all this actually makes a whole lot of

855
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:35,700
sense but you gotta look for those

856
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,020
opportunities take a deep breath when

857
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,410
somebody says something and the first

858
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,570
thing you think is think all right why

859
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,879
don't they understand that is it because

860
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,220
of an age thing is it because you know

861
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,630
this is just not their field what is it

862
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,870
that they're interested in how can I

863
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,430
relate this to them

864
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:55,180
I find all kinds of crazy ways whether

865
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:57,910
it's comic books or movies or TV show I

866
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,770
find great ways to come up with ideas to

867
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:04,720
explain things to people and you have to

868
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:08,850
be creative so educate don't adjudicate

869
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,580
that's not our role we're there to teach

870
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:14,620
and you can learn to because the more

871
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,210
you understand about each one of these

872
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,089
people and their role within an

873
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,680
organization the more you will have a

874
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,600
better understanding of what they're

875
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,109
trying to get done and how you can help

876
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,839
them from a security perspective the way

877
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,190
I look at it is our office in the the

878
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,470
Security office of the University of

879
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,580
Buffalo our goal is to help you do

880
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,700
whatever it is you do with the

881
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:39,520
university more safely it's not to say

882
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,100
no it's not to get in your way it's to

883
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,710
help you be better at what you do and

884
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,930
keep you safe but we can't do it alone

885
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,730
so we have to partner with all of these

886
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,319
people for what it's worth there are

887
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,960
five people in my office and there are

888
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,520
35,000 people on our campus there is no

889
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,230
way we can do that by ourselves and

890
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:01,200
that's typically true in most

891
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:05,590
organizations so again trade information

892
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:09,129
you'll be amazed what you learn so be

893
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:11,980
that change don't be that person who's

894
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:16,210
the jerk we can change IT in every

895
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:23,460
capacity if we choose to change how we

896
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:23,460
perceive other people questions yes

897
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,339
so you can't see their face okay

898
00:37:48,670 --> 00:38:08,530
mm-hmm okay are you talking to them

899
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,350
verbally

900
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:14,840
can you hear their frustrations yeah so

901
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,310
and those are going to be verbal cues so

902
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,990
you're gonna listen in those cases for

903
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,910
verbal cues so for anybody who couldn't

904
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,319
hear the question had to do with how do

905
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,899
you deal with the situation where you're

906
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,760
doing Incident Response in at a distance

907
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,090
and and you're using like WebEx and

908
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,440
you're not necessarily doing any kind of

909
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,150
something with a camera so you can't see

910
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,980
their face but you can hear their voice

911
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,620
so you're going to hear that the other

912
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,680
thing you can do and I I didn't talk

913
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,910
about this a lot but communication

914
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,649
requires two ways if you say stuff and

915
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:48,620
that's that you haven't communicated

916
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:51,020
anything so your best option is to

917
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:58,100
communicate something small and ask for

918
00:38:51,020 --> 00:39:00,500
feedback so if they say to you we don't

919
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:03,500
know what to do ask them what they do

920
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,720
understand start from a point of

921
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,710
understanding and then you can either

922
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,390
correct it and go forward or if they

923
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,910
understand whatever it is move to the

924
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,799
next thing because sometimes we take

925
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,779
chunks that are too big and that's why

926
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,490
they don't understand so I mean it's

927
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,020
gonna be different in each case but

928
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,259
especially when you hear somebody

929
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:27,710
getting like levels of frustration find

930
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:30,020
ways to take a deep breath and step back

931
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:32,420
and say you know I hear you're super

932
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,150
frustrated and you know I want to help

933
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,990
how can I help if they need a vent

934
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,990
bottom vent

935
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,870
right

936
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:08,700
absolutely yeah yeah I mean so so part

937
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,740
of why I said you want to have this

938
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,810
exchange of information is that you want

939
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,180
to go into a department and say we want

940
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,930
to teach you stuff I have never done a

941
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,859
presentation referred Department who

942
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,290
because typically the way it works is

943
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,150
that I get asked to come in but in many

944
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,440
cases I find out that there's been an

945
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,870
issue in a department and they and

946
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,210
they're frustrated I say well how can I

947
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,620
help can I come in and talk and they're

948
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,660
usually very interested in hearing what

949
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,850
I have to say and that gives me the

950
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,620
opportunity to educate so look for

951
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,779
opportunities to educate awareness is

952
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,370
certainly one of them just make sure

953
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,580
that when you start building awareness

954
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:48,790
it's it's got a positive spin it's never

955
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,860
about I caught you doing this you did

956
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,630
the bad thing how many people can we

957
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,910
catch every time I hear somebody talking

958
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,620
about a phishing campaign where they're

959
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,839
doing in-house phishing and it's all

960
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,370
based on negative stuff this doesn't

961
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,350
work people will not learn anything

962
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,480
there has to be positive reinforcement

963
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,220
so I would absolutely recommend some

964
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,730
sort of awareness thing but make it

965
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,290
positive so figure out how what you're

966
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,180
teaching them fits into their business

967
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,920
practices and how it makes how it's

968
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,569
relevant for them they'll be way more

969
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,550
interested in what you have to say and

970
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,760
they'll hear you better

971
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,760
does that help

972
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,720
so unfortunately to a certain degree

973
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,759
that's going to be a policy decision

974
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,910
within your organization and what I have

975
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,859
really stressed in our organization is I

976
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,779
won't do fishing if it's if it's got

977
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:49,220
that kind of spin like I will do a

978
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,780
fishing campaign for you if you

979
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,359
understand that we're not gonna point

980
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,000
fingers at people we're gonna look at

981
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,779
general trends you're always gonna have

982
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,369
certain people that click on the thing

983
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,630
giving additional training is okay but

984
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:04,220
you're gonna get to a point where you

985
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,800
know okay

986
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,839
joke you person over here or J&Q person

987
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,609
over there they're always going to click

988
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:13,279
the thing at that point instead of

989
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:15,950
beating them to death with it find other

990
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,160
ways put put stuff in a VM like find

991
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:21,348
other ways to mitigate that but you're

992
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,770
gonna need probably some some support

993
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:27,640
above you just say you know you can

994
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:30,859
gamify it you can say for everybody who

995
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,900
determines that this is bad you know you

996
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:34,848
get a you get something and you collect

997
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,290
so many and you win a prize or you know

998
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:38,030
depending on your organization if you

999
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,329
can do something like that that never

1000
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,329
hurts

1001
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:03,130
yes yes exactly

1002
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:04,690
yeah so so not only do you want to do

1003
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,030
that but also tie it in to why it

1004
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,160
matters at home because that's another

1005
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,710
thing that that is a really positive

1006
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,509
like see you didn't do it here if you

1007
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,860
don't do it at home and you get in the

1008
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,500
habit of not doing it all the time

1009
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,310
you'll be even safer at home so yeah

1010
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,330
absolutely

1011
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,330
and Han over here yes

1012
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,540
yeah

1013
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,400
so for those of you who may not have

1014
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,830
heard the suggestion is in terms of

1015
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,510
communicating information don't use the

1016
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,119
word but because what ends up happening

1017
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:05,050
is you cut the person off if you use and

1018
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,570
it allows for and continuation so work

1019
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:09,849
with the choice of language that you're

1020
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,560
using and think carefully about that

1021
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:16,210
because you can absolutely turn people

1022
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:18,040
off yes and that's that speaks to what I

1023
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,080
was saying earlier about this idea that

1024
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,880
you know we're there to work with them

1025
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,590
we're there to partner with them we are

1026
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,260
not there to be the bad guy and simply

1027
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:29,080
say no and we're gonna do it together

1028
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,520
exactly yep and you're always gonna have

1029
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,340
you know you're always getting people

1030
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,109
that will push back on you but you know

1031
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,460
for the most part that's I think very

1032
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:38,460
effective question over here

1033
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:55,759
so the question is about using humor I

1034
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:58,519
think you have to know your audience

1035
00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:00,019
really well and I and I do think it can

1036
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:03,198
be a gamble I don't I don't see a

1037
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:05,029
problem with humor I think you know it's

1038
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:07,789
probably wise to do things like let's

1039
00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:11,269
stay away from politics right an areas

1040
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:14,119
that could really be a challenge

1041
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:16,698
but you saw in in my own presentation I

1042
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,739
try to stick with some humorous things

1043
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:21,619
because I think it gets a message across

1044
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:23,690
really well but I try to keep it fairly

1045
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,910
benign but you really have to know your

1046
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:29,719
audience depending on the kind of humor

1047
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:33,910
you're using so yeah other questions

1048
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,910
anybody else yes

1049
00:45:45,230 --> 00:46:04,440
how to get them to care mm-hmm yep so so

1050
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,700
the question has to do with you know how

1051
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,250
do you get people to care about the

1052
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,810
company's data and the answer is you may

1053
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,460
or may not be able to get them to care

1054
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,770
about the company's data but if you can

1055
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,150
get in the habit of them understanding

1056
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,520
why it's so important to do it at home

1057
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:19,170
it will become a habit and they will

1058
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,900
start doing it at work whether or not

1059
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:24,210
they think about it you know because at

1060
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,530
the end of the day what people usually

1061
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:31,070
care about is themselves their family

1062
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:33,270
you can use things like the the

1063
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,700
consequences that I talked about right

1064
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:38,250
so if you have poor company reputation

1065
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,379
and it's a publicly traded company their

1066
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,750
stock could fall meaning there could be

1067
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,240
layoffs I mean you can take it to the to

1068
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,100
an extreme if you have to but that's

1069
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,950
really yeah that's really negative so I

1070
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,529
think you're better off trying to relate

1071
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:55,169
it back to what they care about day to

1072
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,750
day and once you get them to understand

1073
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:00,690
that doing this in general is beneficial

1074
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,490
for them they will just start doing it

1075
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,170
at work that's at least what what

1076
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,370
research has shown is that once people

1077
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,890
get in the habit of doing the right

1078
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:11,580
kinds of things you just do it all the

1079
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:18,120
time right yeah you're welcome other

1080
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:20,250
questions okay well I can tell you that

1081
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,020
I don't necessarily know that I ever

1082
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,590
intended to wind up in information

1083
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,690
security despite my father's job but I

1084
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,030
can tell you that I'm very glad to be

1085
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,660
where I ended up and I thank you very

1086
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:36,750
much for listening

1087
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,750
[Applause]
