1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:15,330
when centric human central and I'm up

2
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:20,560
all right I would have a good conference

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,270
woohoo yeah this is I love freaking love

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,070
converge and I'm really glad you guys

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,270
stuck around for the last talk of the

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,109
day and hanging out with me I really

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,980
appreciate it

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:33,640
this talk is on on design my name is

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,290
wolf Gorelick I've been digging into

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,290
this concept because one of the things

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,059
that's been bothering me from from a

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,710
seesaw perspective from a director

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,540
perspect from a manager perspective we

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,180
got a gazillion security things we have

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,370
to do and knowing which one to do when

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,019
and why and how is always a struggle

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,410
right do I start here or do I start

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,059
there do I do I put in place

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,529
segmentation or do I put in place VPN

20
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,579
should I have a strong perimeter should

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,079
have a weak perimeter so I move

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,809
everything to the cloud or should you

23
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,180
know and trying to make sense of what we

24
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,660
should do is is always a challenge so

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,220
that's why for the past couple months

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,619
I've been focusing very heavily on

27
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,240
design and the next series of talks I'm

28
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:15,670
gonna be giving us all around this kinds

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,699
of design and art and how it all plays

30
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,330
as a see so I am an advisor see some

31
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,860
advisor Cecil duo so thank you duo for

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,439
sponsoring if you haven't said hi to

33
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,060
them please do a great organization I've

34
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,669
been there with about a month now so I'm

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,110
absolutely loving it I also spend way

36
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,420
too much time on Twitter right I always

37
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,240
have and so I want to start off with a

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,220
tale of two tweets one is on the

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,589
internet nobody knows your dog you know

40
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,240
one remember this whole comic nobody

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,220
knows you're a dog and we're arguing

42
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,990
about privacy on Twitter I'm like man

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,520
it's 25 years later now on the internet

44
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,949
we know the breed we know the location

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,710
we know how their education probably

46
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,350
their income and what to toys to sell to

47
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,729
them I mean in the privacy is is just

48
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,619
insane so I threw the stuff I thought

49
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,719
was funny I threw us up on Monday later

50
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:06,149
on on Tuesday I threw this one up about

51
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:08,829
sha-1 right sha-1 collision attacks are

52
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,720
so fricken easy you can download a

53
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,100
script you say hey I want this hash

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
stretch that has she wrote a script

55
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,660
about a boom bada bing sha-1 is

56
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,519
absolutely positively broken one of

57
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,540
these has value from a security

58
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,340
perspective one of them

59
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,929
doesn't and I went and I checked the

60
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,700
stats this morning because I really was

61
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,620
writing these slides as I was flying in

62
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,679
and I checked the stats and it's the

63
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,180
funny one got 298 thousand views and the

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,180
sha1 got 5,000 views

65
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:43,328
nobody freaking cares about security G

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,700
yes that's funny right well retreat the

67
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,349
old one three thousand times three

68
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,700
hundred thousand times and this happens

69
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,530
to be to get in again again if I put

70
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,138
something on that my wife said was

71
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,970
really cute or was sassy everyone

72
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,170
watches that I'm like preparation is

73
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,209
important in cyber security you

74
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,629
shouldn't just do prevention detection

75
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,129
one faith I think ten people viewed it

76
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,120
no one cares about security and this is

77
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,340
something that's struggle with all the

78
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,689
time and of course it's a problem

79
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,970
because effectively we ask our users and

80
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:15,578
our community to juggle chainsaws don't

81
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,530
we I mean we trust people in our

82
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,930
organization to juggle chainsaws and

83
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,919
that creates some really fascinating

84
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,909
challenging security problems obviously

85
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,409
security happens when mankind meets the

86
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,959
Machine that's where the security

87
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,358
happens that moment when we touched the

88
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,489
Machine there's a security decision

89
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,979
being made there and of course it

90
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,919
oftentimes goes wrong anyone watch Sam's

91
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:44,319
talk earlier on the fishing frickin

92
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,879
awesome talk awesome talk and the types

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,738
of things I love about coming to

94
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,629
converge and hearing real-world

95
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,030
practical advice and obviously we hear

96
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,918
all the time about how rampant phishing

97
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,049
is now which gets lost there's an

98
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,479
organization called the ic3 which is

99
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,099
responsible for collecting and

100
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,349
investigating internet crime and

101
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:08,198
business email compromised phishing

102
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:11,828
Leyna business email compromised the

103
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:14,549
losses from that was 1.2 billion billion

104
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:17,560
with ABI billion dollars last year

105
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,880
insane insane so anytime you can do a

106
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,769
fishing camp and of course we're doing

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,530
pretty good but it happens the moment a

108
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,770
user touches the computer similarly

109
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,469
there's the payload diversion payroll

110
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,150
diversion scams where they're like oh

111
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,680
I'll pay this person that thing and

112
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,340
that's like another 100 million dollars

113
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,169
just

114
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,179
leaking out because someone's payroll

115
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,919
got compromised obviously users our

116
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,180
problem but we oftentimes pick end users

117
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,830
because they're easy we pick on users

118
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,770
and their was off only people stopped

119
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,840
clicking on stuff but of course it gets

120
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,109
worse than that cuz software developers

121
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,659
are writing code all the time and are

122
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:58,270
they doing it in a secure way maybe

123
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:01,449
maybe we hope so maybe probably not and

124
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,469
at the same time we've got hey come on

125
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,180
in I was just telling that all the

126
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,180
tweets I'd say about you are always the

127
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,280
one that ever likes cut up and now we

128
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,600
also have IT professionals right so IT

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,609
professionals who are standing up

130
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,639
servers and services and infrastructure

131
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,310
in a secure way probably not in a safe

132
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,229
wait and no but we're relying on them

133
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,639
right especially in the day and age now

134
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,200
where everyone is usually spinning

135
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,820
something up in the cloud probably

136
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,219
hasn't checked with security anyways is

137
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:32,139
in the Amazon so we had no idea about or

138
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,050
worse we find out we're on Azure it

139
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,780
happens right I locked out our Amazon

140
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,930
environment good we just won't tell you

141
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,280
about a jar in a course that's just like

142
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,979
infrastructure-as-a-service

143
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,880
that's not even taking into account

144
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,680
software as a service and everything

145
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,349
else and how many breaches that we have

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,599
this past year from s3 buckets some of

147
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:57,280
us the best three bucket open and didn't

148
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:59,590
jack or didn't know I've got a friend

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,419
client and colleague who actually wrote

150
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,250
a script just to scan his environment

151
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,109
for s3 buckets just because he got sick

152
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,400
of that happening and he still even

153
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,169
though there's been education there's

154
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,510
been conversation we've had culture

155
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,490
folks there is a culture of security

156
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,190
still finds s3 buckets all the time that

157
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,450
is spun up and are open to everything so

158
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,889
we know this happens all the time you

159
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,180
know errors according to the Verizon

160
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,760
data breach report which was recently

161
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,320
released account for 21% of the breaches

162
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,310
someone did something wrong mankind

163
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,800
makes mistakes

164
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,169
mankind touches the machine that's where

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,820
security happens and that led me to

166
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:35,139
start trying to figure out how we could

167
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,849
reinvent we know this about

168
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,250
communication we say this all the time

169
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:42,430
right communication is not what we say

170
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,849
it's what they hear right as managers as

171
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,110
spouses as good human beings we try and

172
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,550
absorb this and remember

173
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,420
not what we said it's what they heard I

174
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,580
would argue that InfoSec security is not

175
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,590
what we control it's ultimately what

176
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,440
they do what they do with the

177
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,210
environment experiences we set up there

178
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,620
for my whole point of this entire talk

179
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,109
is to convince you guys all that hey

180
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,450
design thinking is cool and since I'm

181
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,860
thinking would be a great way to start

182
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,950
thinking about how we can design better

183
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,270
experiences for our users for our folks

184
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,130
I'm gonna cover three different ways we

185
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,330
recover usability and we recover

186
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,520
manageability I'm gonna cover

187
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,990
defensibility I'm gonna wrap it up we'll

188
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,580
get you all the closing comments and I'm

189
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,820
gonna do so hopefully without coughing

190
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,859
or falling asleep so that is my promise

191
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:32,920
to you with my big tub of espresso here

192
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,560
so I start with usability usability

193
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,470
obviously is is designing for users

194
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,780
right designing for the folks who are

195
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,070
doing things a while ago and I know I'm

196
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,650
going off camera so I'm sorry

197
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,270
oh wow go I was doing an audit right so

198
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,280
I used to do audits and do assessments

199
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,510
and I was given an RSA token I love

200
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,859
these are say tokens right you get the

201
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,810
little physical token here's your to

202
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,730
effect this is great and it's okay we're

203
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,810
gonna protect our oven in sevens like

204
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,480
all right how do I do that they're like

205
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,550
you got to use this VPN and it was only

206
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,740
slightly more modern than this display

207
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,650
this was probably the oldest VPN I've

208
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,810
ever ever seen it was like antiquated

209
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,370
barely worked and you put in your

210
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,770
username and password and then you put

211
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,240
in a variation of the first four

212
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,680
characters of your password which

213
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,020
concerned me because if he knew the

214
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,150
first four characters your password that

215
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,799
doesn't seem hash to me does it do you

216
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,090
guys I don't think so

217
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,730
but you do the first four characters

218
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,299
plus the code on your RSA token and then

219
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,980
third time sometimes it would tell you

220
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,080
put your password and wrong usually

221
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,060
because I was hurry and sometimes you'd

222
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,010
have to re-enter just the RSA token

223
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,299
because you put it in right and for

224
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,370
whatever reason the firewall wanted it

225
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,620
to and I get a great message like that

226
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,710
that was step one to get on the network

227
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,930
step two was everyone had a unique one

228
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,450
of these we now had to go to the command

229
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,099
prompt and net use to the drive where

230
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,290
the folder was using a share credential

231
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,120
for my then employer we're getting in

232
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,360
that work evidence and then we pop up

233
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,650
that Network evidence where throughout

234
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,640
the assessment they would periodically

235
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,649
go

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,300
whoof our using oh I'm sorry we just

237
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,920
over wrote that one that's not the right

238
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,029
version that's why your your audits

239
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,490
wrong haha and I'm a security

240
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,930
professional now I had about you know 30

241
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,370
other accounts at the time but I'm a

242
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,609
security professional I'm a technical

243
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,829
person I know how to do all this why am

244
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,050
I doing this every single time it was

245
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,939
terrible it was fundamentally terrible

246
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,160
and I think gets security professionals

247
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,500
we forget yes it's a great idea to have

248
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,689
a VPN and multi-factor yes I believe in

249
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,720
matzo Factory yes we should have shared

250
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,370
folders there / - yes but are we

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
thinking about the experience that we're

252
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,829
giving to our users an experience that

253
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,649
we're asking people to to go through to

254
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:46,540
make anything happen you guys all know

255
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,839
William Gibson right of the of the

256
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,640
famous hack the Gibson the hackers movie

257
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,200
I realized the other day the hackers

258
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,240
movie came out when my career started

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,769
and I used to think that was cool like

260
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,360
yeah hackers came out when I career

261
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,269
started we could like rollerblade in the

262
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,970
data center and I'm like oh my god that

263
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,769
was way too long ago all right so

264
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,240
William Gibson of course guy who the

265
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,010
Gibson was named after had this quote

266
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,860
the street finds its own use for things

267
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,110
what's fascinating is whenever we do not

268
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,180
take usability in the mind whenever do

269
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,800
not take usability no count what our

270
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,060
people do they find their own use of

271
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,859
things they find their own way to do

272
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,209
things they find their own workarounds

273
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,970
they do all the sort of things that give

274
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:29,410
us heartburn and keep us up late at

275
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:32,410
night and cause us to drink seriously

276
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,579
though I like to say that my risk

277
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,230
appetite you know what's your risk

278
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:38,319
appetite my risk appetite is bourbon I

279
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,209
mean at that point in time because users

280
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,860
but they do life hacking they do work

281
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,018
hacking you know why is that creative

282
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,070
constraints is the answer for that if

283
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,110
you guys haven't looked at creative

284
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,430
constraints highly recommend you do so

285
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,709
it's a fascinating field

286
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,359
the basic theory is this the more

287
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:55,239
constraints you put the more creative

288
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,070
people are which really explains why the

289
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,449
tighter the environment is the more

290
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,209
likely people are to put it on a thumb

291
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:04,479
drive copy it down take screenshots do

292
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:07,089
other crazy stuff to work around it we

293
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,819
create the demon of our own making in

294
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,319
this situation so one of the areas I've

295
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,540
been studying for this is human centered

296
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:14,529
design human centered design is about

297
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,689
taking into account the

298
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,339
psychology not just the technology it's

299
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:20,529
about being empathetic which is

300
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,329
sometimes very hard for us we just want

301
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,670
them to do what we ask them to do

302
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,739
it's about being kind it's about being

303
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,360
kinder than necessary to the experience

304
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,430
that we're asking these folks do every

305
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,079
day in and day out and and the one hand

306
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,609
seems kind of soft and cozy feeling

307
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,069
other hand if you take into account

308
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,839
creative constraints I would argue that

309
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:40,809
it actually makes our environments more

310
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,889
secure so human centric design has some

311
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:47,350
design principles contrast right how the

312
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,300
variance of different activities or

313
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,220
different displays look proportioned how

314
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,809
they're aligned proximity and things are

315
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,089
close together human mind is they must

316
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:57,069
be related what the pattern is a

317
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,569
behavior how is it unified how's it

318
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:00,670
aligned with how you thinking how you

319
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:01,779
act and this movement is a repeatable

320
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,149
movement that you can build intuition

321
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,040
about and build skills around so that

322
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:08,319
when you do things it behaves in a

323
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,579
normal way very very fascinating now

324
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,870
you're thinking okay that's cool but

325
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,949
what about security can try really just

326
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,589
one lock my users down part of it is is

327
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,209
the pattern side right you guys may have

328
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,519
heard me say many times that when work

329
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:22,809
looks like work work it's done if a user

330
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,009
sees something and it looks like normal

331
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,139
work they're gonna do it hey great

332
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,490
awesome if it looks confusing if it

333
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:30,459
looks a little different if it looks a

334
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,439
little odd they're gonna get creative we

335
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,660
don't want them to be great you want to

336
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:36,969
take the work out of it so the count's

337
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,309
is a pattern right using pattern for

338
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,050
usability so that people always log in

339
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,160
the same way so there's a similar

340
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,990
experience with their connecting up

341
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
remotely to when they're connecting up

342
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,930
internally so that when they're working

343
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,790
at the coffee shop versus when they're

344
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,758
working at home that you have the same

345
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,519
pattern we're doing development that the

346
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,350
SDLC has a defined pattern that we know

347
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,170
when we're gonna check code and when the

348
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,089
pen testers are gonna test it right that

349
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,399
you have that repeatable process that

350
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,980
kinds of a pattern becomes very very

351
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,360
important because it in grains and

352
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,980
people that this is just how things work

353
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,470
they have it's repeatable and it always

354
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,360
proves the way they predict then they're

355
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,569
gonna follow it the other concept is

356
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,079
movement which is this idea that you

357
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:22,240
know it takes all the work for work not

358
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,309
to feel like work this is an area where

359
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,020
C cells and CIOs have to spend a lot of

360
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:30,170
time to make things empathetic to make

361
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,480
in a way that is intuitive and reduces

362
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,920
cognitive load it takes a lot of work to

363
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,100
remove the friction out of those systems

364
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,780
but in doing so again would make it

365
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,370
easier and then you pattern that with

366
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,140
movement so it's something they predict

367
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,660
they can go ahead and follow it you know

368
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,730
the best systems only work when people

369
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,660
do not have to work very hard to make

370
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:54,110
them work if that makes sense so as a

371
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,770
contrast to my other example I had

372
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,660
another client

373
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,720
I love these clients this is right after

374
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,880
the one without a funky VPN I'm like we

375
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,290
prefer to use our own system for a lot

376
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,880
of information I need another token I

377
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,860
know that's how gonna go yeah yeah it's

378
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,200
box-like yes

379
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,520
score how do I get the box like it's

380
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,400
simple you know the MFA you're using

381
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,290
just use that I'm like oh my goodness I

382
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,030
want to hug you guys and oh by the way

383
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,069
we got version control turned on so if

384
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,760
we make any mistakes you can like to see

385
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,020
what versions we have so we can like I

386
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,430
wanted to hug them after this thing I

387
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,110
still gave him a terrible audit because

388
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm a mean guy I mean they had problems

389
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,560
their problems right yeah it's still

390
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,810
hold people accountable but it was great

391
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,069
and it was an area where when you

392
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,079
compared to the other things the other

393
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,630
environment was very quick very

394
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,220
intuitive and I was able to go ahead and

395
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,480
follow pattern of practice this is very

396
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,860
simple to me I go to box all the time I

397
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,760
go to drop all the time right

398
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,340
very very simple another example of this

399
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,720
concept comes from a friend of mine in

400
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,880
the federal space and she's was working

401
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,710
on FedRAMP I was doing a project maybe

402
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,750
got a couple of my talks in this I was

403
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,830
securing without slowing the premise I

404
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,440
was trying to find out was what

405
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,320
organizations have introduced security

406
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,140
without slowing down the user experience

407
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,210
preferably made it quicker

408
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,560
shockingly the answer was very few like

409
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,030
who's done this and everyone's sit on

410
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,680
their hands like someone has had to have

411
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,480
done this and it took me forever to get

412
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,339
any like good examples and then finding

413
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,350
people like I I kind of sort of like yes

414
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,090
tell me what you did and this was one

415
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,770
example for a friend of mine in the

416
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,880
federal government space FedRAMP is a

417
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,860
standard does anyone know a federal

418
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,600
offense where we had so a couple people

419
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,130
- all right so basically if you think

420
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,730
about nest it's a whole bunch in this

421
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,220
controls

422
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,380
applied to a federal program where

423
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,310
you're running a application in the

424
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,410
cloud for the federal gun

425
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,878
make sense and you got to do code

426
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,959
freezes and get to you ass monitoring a

427
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,910
whole bunch of other stuff and it's

428
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,339
fantastic and it's hard insecure great

429
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:52,069
now she was responsible for running

430
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:54,800
FedRAMP and doing internal audits for a

431
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:56,779
whole bunch of Gov amps and every single

432
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,609
time they would do a gob app they would

433
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,230
check it and she go you missed a whole

434
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,610
bunch of stuff and they'd check it again

435
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,410
you still miss a bunch of stuff to the

436
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,999
res little s I check it a third time

437
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,189
okay now you're getting closer and these

438
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:10,069
types of assessments would oftentimes go

439
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:11,629
one to two years and she made the

440
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,949
realization that hey a lot of these

441
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:16,069
things that we're finding are the same

442
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:17,748
issues people have the same pattern work

443
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:19,969
people who follow the same movement to

444
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:23,240
create FedRAMP apps so she pulled her

445
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,920
top people pulled him out the skunkworks

446
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,240
project for three months three months

447
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,459
later they came out with templates and

448
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,990
said hey if you wanna be FedRAMP

449
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,300
certified quicker here's all the

450
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,829
templates you need and by following

451
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,508
these templates people cut it from two

452
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:37,370
years down to three to six months

453
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:38,749
because already all the controls were

454
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,800
there already all the processes were

455
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,059
there they could spin up images

456
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,569
everything was hardened and ready and

457
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,649
whatnot I love that I love that idea

458
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,290
that they were able to actually make

459
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:50,899
things much more quick and speedy and

460
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,939
reduce time to market for all these

461
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,379
federal applications by having to find

462
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:56,240
templates and thinking about security

463
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,639
ahead of time and working with the way

464
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,209
these folks worked really freaking cool

465
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,209
story so the overall idea is we want to

466
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,889
design for usability right and we want

467
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,919
to do so in a way that is easier for the

468
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,500
users to work so if they get fished

469
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,980
hopefully you know MFA's kicking on so

470
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,929
they don't do anything wrong if they're

471
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,909
you know financial compromised happens

472
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,439
hey please transfer me a gazillion

473
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:23,390
dollars and they go oh my god it's the

474
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,860
CEO and he's clearly needs a gazillion

475
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,970
dollars i'm gonna click send that

476
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,770
hopefully there's a process that the

477
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,990
bank goes what wait a minute we need a

478
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,100
2-person validation we want to have

479
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,750
these patterns so that when people are

480
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,549
writing code they start with code that

481
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,659
is from templates already secured

482
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,970
building systems are starting from

483
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:39,530
systems are secure that we've got the

484
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,929
way that we can reuse friction and

485
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,379
effort across the systems that people

486
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:48,620
are using point number one point number

487
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:52,039
two is all about defense ability so how

488
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,100
can we build systems that are defensible

489
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,600
right how can we build systems

490
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,039
that are designed for the criminal

491
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,799
element how compelled system that

492
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,879
prevent people from you know taking

493
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,929
advantage own right though we're

494
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,830
protected and and this gets to what I

495
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,820
used to call my my free pen test so some

496
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,649
of you guys already know the story if

497
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,889
you've been around my sect for a while

498
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,650
besides Detroit 2011 we've stepped out

499
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,120
and afterwards we're all excited there

500
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,470
was a panel and duck song it's like we

501
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,270
need to make this a regular part of our

502
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,950
community we're like yeah and one guy's

503
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,408
like we need to meet all the time I'll

504
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,179
speak now just like I'll I'll create a

505
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,950
chat you know I Christina Slav creates

506
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,230
an IRC and I'm like people can come to

507
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,270
my place and it was awesome and at the

508
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,190
time I was predominantly in the

509
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,870
financial services firm predominately

510
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,700
around building systems and that in my

511
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,070
mind security was good engineering

512
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,039
practices good coding practices I like

513
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,570
this is great I know as much as my four

514
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,780
walls right that's pretty typical if

515
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,370
your internal guy I was having a dinner

516
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,020
with a whole bunch of CIOs and Cecil's

517
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,309
in Phoenix last night and we're all

518
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,620
complaining about that right you know

519
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,549
your box really well you don't

520
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,719
necessarily know what other people are

521
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,400
doing in their boxes and how that

522
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,900
transfers so like this is great I'll be

523
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,390
able to bring people in who can give me

524
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,010
insights and of course if you're a

525
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,010
security person we all know the budget

526
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:11,789
we're working with which is zero and can

527
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,530
you cut that preferably by next quarter

528
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,210
so I'm like I don't have much money so I

529
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,350
can have some smart people in and they

530
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,049
can give me advice I mean this is

531
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,820
fantastic so all my set comes to my my

532
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,620
datacenter I open it up I'm badging

533
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,299
people in we're getting people coffee we

534
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,689
have some bagels it's fantastic we sit

535
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,908
down

536
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,620
Josh little anyone take his workshop the

537
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,330
past couple days just his workshop see

538
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,129
frickin awesome you guys have a good

539
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,990
time on that I admire the hot guy that

540
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,730
guy he was the first guy to come to our

541
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,710
desks and present he presented on the

542
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,010
web app bones I think it was single

543
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,750
injection probably and and so he was

544
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,240
presenting and everything and pretty

545
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:50,320
quickly people are like oh by the way I

546
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,270
just popped your Wi-Fi I'm like what how

547
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,980
did you even do that apparently I didn't

548
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,270
set it up right who knew and a person is

549
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,320
like oh by the way I'm on your network

550
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,418
I'm like you cannot be on my network

551
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,070
I've got knack with a MAC address I'm

552
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,360
like oh yeah well we just like did you

553
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,889
know that you could like you know

554
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,750
listening to a MAC address and I can

555
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,390
just spoof a MAC address like the hell

556
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,730
you can change your MAC address off mine

557
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,650
and then someone else is telling me we

558
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,410
had like these RFID keys and yet they're

559
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,760
like - man swipe and man trapped like oh

560
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,059
yeah by the way I could probably like

561
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,860
clone that RFID key and that's about the

562
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:23,139
time I'm like this is not a good idea I

563
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,870
think this is a quick way for me to get

564
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:28,360
fired maybe I don't want to have like so

565
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,909
it was a really eye-opening experience

566
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,620
and part of the problem was as an

567
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,299
engineer I went how do I set up Wi-Fi

568
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,559
and went online it says here's how you

569
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,940
do Wi-Fi and guess what those

570
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,620
instructions were vulnerable they were

571
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,090
known bad how do I set up the door

572
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,799
system you're online you talk to someone

573
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,689
and they set up the door systems all the

574
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,549
same way right and guess what all those

575
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,040
keys can be cloned we all make the same

576
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,960
mistakes over and over again it's just

577
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,428
constant a monoculture that we argue

578
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,840
about all the time right what if you

579
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,429
have different you know diversity and

580
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,290
everything else that if we had where I'm

581
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,760
at when spread well we're really good at

582
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,139
following design patterns image

583
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,510
engineering and in software development

584
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,370
those design patterns leader monoculture

585
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,429
it makes it very easy for the criminals

586
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,280
or the curious to come up with great

587
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:12,610
ways to worm off' i it make it

588
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,780
repeatable and go after us and and we

589
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,780
know that we know that's a problem

590
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,950
excuse me i will get through this

591
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,400
without coughing into the microphone

592
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:27,790
that's my commitment you guys and so we

593
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,470
see this right and things like RTP how

594
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,610
many of us have RDP exposed over the

595
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,510
internet don't raise your hands I don't

596
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:38,439
want to know don't don't what's up and

597
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:42,850
RDP yet no no we're on camera no code of

598
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:47,049
silence but RDP right 2019 zero seven

599
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,939
zero eight one of the first times in my

600
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:50,530
recollection that Microsoft went you

601
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,470
know what I know we said we're not

602
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,139
patching XP but we're patching XP that

603
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,929
is a problem folks this is a

604
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,400
vulnerability that is quite likely going

605
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:03,190
to be wormed it's quite alive if you

606
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,990
here to spread everywhere and and the

607
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,970
point is is that RTP is always on port

608
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,650
3389 right that's how you've set up so

609
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,210
I've already P we're gonna open it up

610
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,549
and maybe we'll have people VPN or

611
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,290
whatnot maybe we'll have this trusted

612
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:16,360
network I love the idea of the trusted

613
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:19,270
network which is completely behind the

614
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,918
firewall which is also where all your

615
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,250
users are all your other devices guests

616
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,170
and

617
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,970
anything else probably not that trusted

618
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,100
but we'll open up to the trusted network

619
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,040
because we can can trust that and that's

620
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,899
all run RDP now one of the things I

621
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,600
think is very interesting is if we do

622
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:38,140
get wormed and it's warm spreads

623
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:41,439
everywhere what happens to people not

624
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:45,220
running RDP in 33 tonight probably not

625
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,050
gonna get whacked right right away or

626
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,150
it's gonna force someone to do manual

627
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,430
testing or it's gonna be a worm that

628
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,310
scans your entire port range which will

629
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,290
take forever most people who do just a

630
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:00,970
little bit of tweaking it's a great way

631
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:01,840
to quickly break a bug or a worm well

632
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,070
usually don't think about that because

633
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,959
all security throw up security that's

634
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,520
bad we were taught that was bad school

635
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,160
they said those bad we know that son we

636
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,320
don't do that but we think about

637
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,300
criminal hacking it's often those same

638
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,919
period of constraints here's the

639
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,450
constraints here's how the environment

640
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,760
is set up and that of course pushes

641
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,890
criminals to be better criminals what

642
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,480
can we do to make things more tricky we

643
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,000
all know we all know we've say this all

644
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,860
the time I'm on the defense side I gotta

645
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,870
be right every single time but the

646
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,860
criminals they only need to be right

647
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,989
once we hear that all the time right

648
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,810
it's kind of our cop-out whenever we

649
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,580
miss something

650
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,350
Verizon data breach report finally has

651
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,550
stats on this and it made me so happy it

652
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,620
looks like something like this let me

653
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:44,500
walk you through this this is how likely

654
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,159
attack is to succeed as you can see it

655
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,640
falls down one two steps they win we

656
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,040
lose the more steps it takes the harder

657
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,500
it is to do it if you can shift an

658
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,300
attacker from one step to win to five

659
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,330
steps to win their chance of succeeding

660
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,950
has now dropped to about 50% isn't it

661
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,810
fantastic I mean for years we've been

662
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,760
like oh well we know they need to be

663
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,190
right every single time for every single

664
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,500
step that we put in their way plus avoid

665
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,510
our detection if we make them port scan

666
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,640
and guess how likely are we to catch

667
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,010
them then right make it more noisy and

668
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,620
then they can win it's really quite a

669
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,990
fascinating flip on the common way of

670
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,820
thinking about things

671
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,620
it's also an interesting way again to

672
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,450
use human centric design because in

673
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,550
human centric design for usability is

674
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,000
all about making it nice and reducing

675
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,940
friction

676
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,230
human centric design for defensibility

677
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,500
is about making

678
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:41,169
human nightmare for the criminals okay

679
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,990
we make it so hard and so complicated so

680
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,760
convoluted that they have to do 5 10 15

681
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,410
20 steps to get in because when they do

682
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,870
we know we're gonna stop them be able to

683
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,190
catch them and crack it and there's been

684
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,949
some great stories over the years about

685
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,720
this people who have done honey pots

686
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,210
right people who've done sequel

687
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,350
instances that have wasted criminals

688
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:04,090
times for instance I love again

689
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,209
different ports on different areas

690
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,199
changing things a little bit so that

691
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,870
there's enough security through

692
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,760
obscurity that people get distracted

693
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,500
confused and be muddled and which gives

694
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,000
us an opportunity to catch them and if

695
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,250
it's malware it gives us an opportunity

696
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,500
to break that malware I used to run all

697
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,929
my servers back in the day my metaframe

698
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,100
servers on the em drive which was

699
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:25,690
freaking awesome because all the malware

700
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,428
back in the day was written for the C

701
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,250
Drive and it would crash and we get

702
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:32,110
infected all the time I mean no no but

703
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,549
theoretically we might have been

704
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,020
infected a few times and the malware

705
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:36,520
would always break because we're in a

706
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,418
different Drive it was a fantastic way

707
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,500
of doing Thanks

708
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:43,000
so a couple examples of this this one

709
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,640
will no longer work but it's one of my

710
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,620
favorite stories this was a my sec

711
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,230
person she discovered and backtrack of

712
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,090
course had the default username root and

713
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,390
tor right root and tour was house both

714
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,490
and you could ssh into it and also kind

715
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,410
of cool is if he booted on to the

716
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,790
backtrack CD had had a predefined

717
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,490
signature that you could detect very

718
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,470
easily on the network so she noticed and

719
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,380
she wrote a script that would detect it

720
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,299
on the network whenever a backtrack

721
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,460
machine was plugged in and would

722
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,760
immediately associate into it and shut

723
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,190
it down

724
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,710
and so pen testers would come up and

725
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,540
they'd oh I'm gonna pack your boxes I'm

726
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,190
gonna flip the table and then why does

727
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,720
it keep shutting down and they go one

728
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,700
day two day three days and they'd be

729
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,040
like you know four days into it I can't

730
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,929
even figure it out it was phenomenal I

731
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,820
love that we can start messing around

732
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:33,070
with these concepts to make it really

733
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,870
difficult and friction for friction for

734
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,678
full of friction all right another

735
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:40,360
example that I like is looking at

736
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,520
indicators that wouldn't matter at all

737
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,719
to our users because often times so we

738
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,730
talked about that like pole between

739
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,700
usability and defensibility if we make

740
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,980
it too easy for our users to

741
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:54,470
for the criminals if we think about

742
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,789
things like like throttling and and

743
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:57,929
thresholds and rate limits we can start

744
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,600
doing some cool things because for

745
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:03,210
example no one should get no users

746
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,029
should get like 500 400 fours in a

747
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,110
couple minutes that's probably a mistake

748
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,330
right

749
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,908
that's probably someone scanning for a

750
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:15,269
whole bunch of pages maybe probably not

751
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:16,559
a user typing things in or 500s if

752
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,960
you're getting a whole bunch of 500s

753
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,210
real quick it's probably Josh little

754
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,610
know and someone doing something you

755
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,299
shouldn't all right so if we look for

756
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,740
these things I had a customer who wrote

757
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,990
a very simple script that would

758
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,630
threshold those and if somebody happened

759
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,399
in a minute he had a nginx firewall and

760
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,559
he would send a road to the nginx fire

761
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,939
well let me block him for an hour

762
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,549
because if it was a valid user by the

763
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,710
time they had a problem and they called

764
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:45,510
it a helpdesk ticket and things happen

765
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,210
about an hour will go by and by the time

766
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,769
it's fixed itself via thresholded both

767
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,630
of those things how much time does it

768
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:53,220
usually take to fix these things versus

769
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,399
how many times do we want to put things

770
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,139
in so we can start playing with these

771
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,549
concepts of raising the level of

772
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:02,100
difficulty in the friction for the

773
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,260
attacker in ways like thresholds and

774
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,629
alerts that don't raise the level of

775
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,769
friction and difficulty for our users so

776
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,809
that's what we talked about warned

777
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:12,029
designing for defense ability that's

778
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:15,120
what we talk about when we're designing

779
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:19,080
and bouncing against those two

780
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,049
constraints finally manageability

781
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,760
manageability is of course what the

782
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:26,279
security operations team has to do what

783
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,200
we oftentimes have to do in the back end

784
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,549
to make sure if something happens that

785
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,409
we're jumping on it that we're taking

786
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:32,820
care of these things they're aware of

787
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,529
the alerts that were on top of it that

788
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,418
we're patching systems catching bones

789
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:37,679
and doing threat intelligence and

790
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,880
sharing information and doing

791
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,039
vulnerability management continuous

792
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,779
monitoring and security our creation and

793
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,760
automation and I didn't the access meant

794
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:46,769
anything user behavior analytics and

795
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,539
blockchain and big data that we're doing

796
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:50,750
all those things that we've got it all

797
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,750
under control

798
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:57,299
a while ago I was doing our threat

799
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,879
modeling and we put in place this

800
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,200
control part of critical security

801
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:04,019
controls that base

802
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,659
you said if folks were logging in to a

803
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,370
disabled account do an alert it's one of

804
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,029
the critical security controls it's been

805
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,559
in there forever

806
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:13,110
the accounts disabled no one should

807
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,860
login and at the same time I was running

808
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:19,529
a sim called IBM curator now IBM curator

809
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,120
was was just glorious system that I had

810
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:23,580
all sorts of alerts and threatened tell

811
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,080
another I was part of the Isaac defense

812
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,539
Isaac so we had all sorts of stuff

813
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,830
popping up into it all the time and what

814
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:35,070
happened was we set up this rule on a

815
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:37,678
Thursday on a Friday one of the

816
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,049
employees was let go and she had a VPN

817
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,429
at home and she went home and tried the

818
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,049
entire weekend to log in now our

819
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:45,720
password was disabled or account was

820
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:48,539
disabled she didn't get anywhere but she

821
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:54,450
generated tens of alerts hundreds of

822
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:56,519
alerts and and the so that was Thursday

823
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,320
I had Monday Friday off had Monday off I

824
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:00,720
came back on Tuesday and the counselors

825
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,980
just blown up I'm like why guys why

826
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,529
aren't you looking at this we're getting

827
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,559
all these alerts but why why are you not

828
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:09,570
jumping in on this security 101 respond

829
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,450
to the alerts hey you know they said to

830
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:15,870
me they said just figure wolf doing what

831
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,610
wolf does what again you're always doing

832
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,018
crazy stuff and then there's alerts and

833
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,990
everyone runs so I wasn't really the

834
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:24,149
paint I'm like oh so I had a serious

835
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,159
talk with them about paying attention

836
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:29,850
alerts and everything but when I was out

837
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,630
at is you squared I was without Cooper

838
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,330
all right we're having this conversation

839
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,409
yeah you can ID we're heading this

840
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,269
conversation I don't remember who it was

841
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,950
was someone when I was talking telling

842
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:40,649
the story and there is her Hannah like

843
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:44,610
yeah but wolf what were you doing about

844
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:45,809
alert fatigue I was like back in a waist

845
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,908
long everybody know but it was their

846
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,440
fault you're missing the point of the

847
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:51,389
story it wasn't my fault it was their

848
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,919
fault they didn't check what were you

849
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:55,229
doing about alert fatigue I didn't feel

850
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,940
like a two-man team reviewing his logs

851
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,490
and I'm throwing like hundreds of alerts

852
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,470
at them a day that's a hell of a lot of

853
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,760
alert fatigue right of course you're

854
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,610
just right-clicking closing and all

855
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,080
figuring I was doing something stupid so

856
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,370
we start thinking about manageability we

857
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,710
also have to think about the cognitive

858
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,928
load and the friction we're introducing

859
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,100
and the security team who's responsible

860
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:15,149
for looking at these things

861
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,830
this becomes a Cree

862
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:18,689
so important when we think about the way

863
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,639
I'd have defined security over the past

864
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,419
couple years which is not castle walls

865
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:26,459
not high strong doors right its bells on

866
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,869
strings bells and strings across the

867
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,059
environment the ring whenever an

868
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:32,189
attackers moving through again if we can

869
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:35,428
get them down at five ten steps we have

870
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,139
a great deal of success and detecting

871
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,869
and stopping them as shown by the resin

872
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:41,129
did it preach report so if we can get

873
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:42,238
them to do that we're gonna rig it spot

874
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:44,009
though if we get them to do that that

875
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:45,659
means lots amounts of alerts so somehow

876
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:48,269
we need to balance these things and have

877
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:51,809
taken into account the alert fatigue

878
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:53,609
going back to being empathetic and kind

879
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,469
not only to our users

880
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:57,418
but to also our security professionals

881
00:31:55,469 --> 00:31:59,879
going back and looking at these design

882
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:00,899
principles and applying them in a

883
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,699
positive way

884
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:05,399
to the folks who are now responsible for

885
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,889
managing this morass of a security

886
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,228
environment that we've created for most

887
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:12,678
organizations the two I wanna look at is

888
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,399
alignment and unity alignment is

889
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,619
communicating the positioning of

890
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,468
information in actions right alignment

891
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:21,689
is how are your security tools aligned

892
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:25,129
how are they feeding from one to another

893
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:27,179
how are they presenting a common view

894
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:29,728
oftentimes when I look at something as

895
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,889
simple as threat and hunting with a

896
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:34,469
phishing email what do you do with that

897
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:36,059
you copy the email that was put in the

898
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:37,950
ticket you copy it down you throw it up

899
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,450
into another tool you pull off the md5

900
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,679
signature you put it in another tool

901
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,089
that looks and then you look at the

902
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,099
header for the IP address you throw that

903
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:45,479
into your blacklist right and you buy

904
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,820
next time you're in like ten different

905
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:50,849
systems or copying pasting trying to

906
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,489
create mentally some model of what your

907
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:55,168
you're doing what the users happen it's

908
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:56,789
really really kludgy when you think

909
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:59,940
about what we asked a lot of security

910
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:01,859
professionals to do our unity is another

911
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,979
one unity is how all those elements come

912
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:06,718
together right can we pull out api's and

913
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:09,089
have a lot of this automated

914
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:11,609
orchestrated can we look at sort

915
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:13,349
echnology and that orchestration to say

916
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:15,299
okay if this comes in follow this

917
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:17,639
pipeline and present us a common view

918
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,440
can we reduce the amount of alerts that

919
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:21,269
we're responding to still keep them so

920
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,909
we can dig into it but reduce it down

921
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:25,379
this is called a double diamond model of

922
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:26,669
design now we just had the threat

923
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,100
intelligence talking here which is the

924
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:30,140
diamond model this is not the

925
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,330
threat intelligence double diamond medal

926
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,660
doubles good there's nothing to a threat

927
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:38,059
intelligence but exactly right two is

928
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,309
always better than one when you're doing

929
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:42,379
design and this follows for cyber

930
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,120
security you start with that having any

931
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,650
idea what's going on and you explore a

932
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,449
whole bunch of alternatives and to

933
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,039
converge on what you think the problem

934
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,390
is they explore a bunch of the

935
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,910
alternatives to converging what you

936
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:55,160
think the solution is right that is how

937
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:57,230
we oftentimes go about doing cyber

938
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,590
security the challenge is with so many

939
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,789
tools you get about right here and then

940
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,260
you think it's something else you go

941
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,580
back to there you get over here you

942
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,289
think you have a good problem statement

943
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,750
because you think it's just a fish and

944
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:10,730
really it's a determined attacker and

945
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,918
then you're way off the weeds over here

946
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,570
or you get about right up to here and

947
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,250
then it's like something funny on

948
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:19,149
Twitter and you got to retweet it and

949
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,149
then you go get some coffee

950
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:27,800
it's crazy so I think design theory to

951
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,109
industrial design offers us some really

952
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,149
cool stuff that we can use in leverage

953
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,730
to try and figure out the best way to

954
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:36,379
put in place those tools so that we can

955
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,119
look at the workflow the experiences of

956
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,279
those innocent providers and try and

957
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,659
design something better and we thinking

958
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,090
it's like the artist formerly known as

959
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,470
see so right what do you do we designed

960
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,480
for the experience of the security team

961
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:48,949
we prioritize preparation over to

962
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,210
prevention etext and that was it other

963
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,600
tweet that I tweeted that no one liked

964
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,879
so here's the thing about that we've

965
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,279
been really good since winch or two and

966
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,319
the 1990s a prevention detection the

967
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,540
security right we prevent we detect

968
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,850
that's awesome and what's that trained a

969
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,160
lot of CISOs and directors as ago before

970
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,509
you talk to me about your product tell

971
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,819
me how it drives prevention detection

972
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,130
just by golly I read Gartner and I know

973
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:18,109
so that's that right we do this and get

974
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:20,540
it again so the challenge that is good

975
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:23,060
for bench in the detection is very very

976
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,550
tactical and what happens right now

977
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,810
right now when something happens all the

978
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,980
information we do we do the Double

979
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:33,549
Diamond of the week trying worth of

980
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:36,170
thing preparation the practice the

981
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,180
analysis the workflow right the

982
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,400
gamification preparation is something

983
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,868
that we oftentimes completely overlook

984
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,910
because it's not no forests away

985
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,380
it's not in a garden product and we

986
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,749
don't necessarily know how to build that

987
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,430
in I think because of that we're so

988
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:51,019
focused on prevention detection that

989
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,288
preparation there one thing that we

990
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:55,999
could do is strategically is overlooked

991
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:59,089
if we're focused on prevention and

992
00:35:55,999 --> 00:36:01,368
detection then preparation we're adding

993
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,900
a lot of controls and that would say for

994
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:04,519
security teams right now for every

995
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,859
single addition there needs to be

996
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:10,008
subtraction every time I add a tool or

997
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:12,680
technique or an alert we need to be

998
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:15,230
taking away a tool a technique or an

999
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,999
alert neck on who may still need it but

1000
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,589
something that is managing that and

1001
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:20,930
cognitive overhead every time we add

1002
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:23,210
something take something away so it can

1003
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,069
be kind of compassionate towards our

1004
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:28,009
info stack professionals and as well as

1005
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:30,740
enabling them to be very good so what

1006
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:34,700
does that look like in practice

1007
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:37,910
there is a guy up in Michigan who runs

1008
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,828
IBM qradar and I really admire the heck

1009
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,420
out of this guy he's so cool

1010
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,920
and he's got this great security

1011
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,049
operation center and everything I ever

1012
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:49,190
wanted got rated floors and cameras and

1013
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:51,440
lowliness it's fantastic and he gets

1014
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,519
attacked all the time I mean hundreds of

1015
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,259
times a day they're running through

1016
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:58,069
these workflows trying to do all these

1017
00:36:54,259 --> 00:37:00,589
things and what's fascinating is on

1018
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:02,480
their wall their main wall right all

1019
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:04,989
these people sing in the desk staring at

1020
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,749
this main wall it's not a pew pew map

1021
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:10,369
it's not threat intelligence by Twitter

1022
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:11,598
does that ever really work we argue

1023
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:13,460
about that in the hallway thread now

1024
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,930
just my Twitter right how do I get

1025
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,599
threatened tell just I stay on top of

1026
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,970
Twitter and I look at cat pictures know

1027
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,799
what he has is he's built a dashboard

1028
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:25,279
that looks something like this it's

1029
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:28,309
engine lights he's got eight different

1030
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:31,549
categories and those categories all have

1031
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:33,910
alerts high volumes certain types of

1032
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:36,829
alarms certain types of conditions and

1033
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,779
if you look and it's blank we're good

1034
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:41,269
we're green and I think start letting up

1035
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:42,769
they know to change the priority and

1036
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:44,390
focus of certain teams in the Security

1037
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:46,669
Operations Center everything has been

1038
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,078
simplified down to that point now if the

1039
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,700
engine light comes on you better believe

1040
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,430
they're gonna pull over pull a couple

1041
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,930
guys off deep dive into the alerts to

1042
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,279
figure out what's going on but it's not

1043
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,470
much better than throwing

1044
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,560
200 or 300 400 lots of them every single

1045
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,270
day it's really a different way of doing

1046
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,520
things I'm much more simplified way of

1047
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,930
doing things and in addition to this

1048
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,990
when this team does back to preparation

1049
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:11,000
as they do quarterly exercises they look

1050
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,259
at what's recently been happening in

1051
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,750
their environment they look at what's

1052
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,070
common as their threats look at some of

1053
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,960
their peers and what's going on there

1054
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,940
and they say hey great let's all get in

1055
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,170
the room let's talk through this and

1056
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,340
let's figure out what would happen if

1057
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,290
that happened here and oh by the way you

1058
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,820
would do you will use that tool show me

1059
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,470
that - oh that's awesome you would

1060
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,910
contain it with a Cisco switch do you

1061
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,980
know what those commands are do we have

1062
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,049
those things written down right if they

1063
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,570
talk through all these things and then

1064
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:38,599
refresh the run books and they're very

1065
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,010
very careful with adding anything if

1066
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,200
they had anything they want to make sure

1067
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,540
it's data-driven

1068
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,348
and supported by facts and ideally

1069
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:50,170
that's replacing something else really

1070
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,900
well-designed well-thought-out

1071
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:58,340
empathetic way are running a security

1072
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:02,030
operation center all right so in

1073
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:04,270
conclusion this is about design this is

1074
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:07,040
about thinking about the environment

1075
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,750
experiences we provide people through

1076
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,800
the lens of industrial design through

1077
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:15,020
the lens of UI UX it's about saying that

1078
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,300
security ultimately depends on empathy

1079
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,820
we need to be kind we need to be kind

1080
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,380
and we forget that we so forget that

1081
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,900
because I don't know about you guys but

1082
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:27,200
I grew up in the day and age of hackers

1083
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,940
and IT and hack the Gibson and configure

1084
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,740
the technology and the users are stupid

1085
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,359
mom and dad don't understand email and

1086
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,709
use that's pretty cool and I just

1087
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:35,509
learned how to do something awesome and

1088
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,160
I can get route and tour if I go write

1089
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,380
some software and rummage through the

1090
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,319
garbage this was a great time in the 90s

1091
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,750
it was fun it was not an empathetic time

1092
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,400
and when we think about how security is

1093
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,380
evolved it's not necessarily evolved to

1094
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,930
think about the experiences that we're

1095
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,270
delivering to our users and to our

1096
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,830
management and then the flood is to the

1097
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,920
bad guys or we make it incredibly

1098
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:59,740
inhumane a bad for them the way to do

1099
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,480
this is to think about things in those

1100
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:05,479
combinations how we're making it simple

1101
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,290
for those groups and hard for those

1102
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,930
groups

1103
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:12,300
and saying that IT does not have to be

1104
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,490
mechanical does not have to be technical

1105
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,960
it is a mechanical art as a technical

1106
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,180
art and much the same as painting and

1107
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,400
sculpture and all the other things that

1108
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,230
we go into design there's this great

1109
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,430
series on Netflix I encourage you guys

1110
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,040
to watch if you're interested this

1111
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:29,220
concept called abstract and I watched an

1112
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:33,000
hour of a guy designing a Nike shoe I

1113
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:35,009
don't like Nike shoes Air Jordans I'm

1114
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,900
not really into basketball but it was

1115
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,790
fantastic the amount of craftsmanship

1116
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,100
and the Macan of art that he had to do

1117
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:43,259
to build these shoes and all that just

1118
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,200
gets subsumed in this you know design

1119
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,420
and this experience from Michael Jordan

1120
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,830
for everyone about shoes ultimately IT

1121
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,140
does not have to be mechanical it does

1122
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,509
not have to be utilitarian it can be

1123
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,569
creative IT security can be very

1124
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,790
creative you may be very artistic it can

1125
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:02,210
be a way for self-expression and it can

1126
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,590
be fundamentally marvelous we create

1127
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,290
phenomenal experiences for our end users

1128
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,840
and for those responsible for defending

1129
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,090
folks for making the human mistakes that

1130
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,890
all too often we make that lead to

1131
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:19,560
security concerns I think we have a

1132
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:23,368
moral obligation right to our users and

1133
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,770
our peers I think we we have a need to

1134
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:27,810
design better experiences to design

1135
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,660
better controls and I think it's an area

1136
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,859
that's right for plumbing and I would

1137
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,660
highly encourage you guys if you're

1138
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:37,640
interested to check out abstract and

1139
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:40,170
other design theories and hit me up over

1140
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,150
email or on the web if you want to talk

1141
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,150
further thank you very much

1142
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,020
join me do Q&A you can stop the video

1143
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,759
everything else is off the record
