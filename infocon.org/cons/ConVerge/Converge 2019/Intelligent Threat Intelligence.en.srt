1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,510
we've got two interesting data sets that

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,160
are a byproduct of the product and we've

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,370
published a couple papers recently just

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,210
academic ones on what that data means so

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,740
the first data set is all the

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,050
vulnerabilities and assets that our

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,150
customers have now you can think of that

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,400
as describing enterprise environments

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,349
we've got about 400 enterprises in there

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,930
it's up to four point seven billion

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,850
vulnerabilities over 15 million assets

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,110
and an asset is an IP a database

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,620
whatever you scan in with a koala

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,999
scanner

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,169
véra code or countable or rapid7 got

16
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:44,769
twenty scanners in there and that data

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,480
is asset vulnerability then we try to

18
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:47,739
figure out the risk of those and so this

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,510
is where the second data set comes in

20
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,248
which is super interesting and that's

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,358
what my team curates I run data science

22
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:57,940
at Kenna security we have what I think

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,120
is the most comprehensive data set of in

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,809
the wild exploitation so not necessarily

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,550
a breach

26
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:05,229
maybe nothing happened but when a

27
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,330
vulnerability is successfully

28
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,960
technically compromised an IDs signature

29
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,060
gets triggered that vulnerability exists

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,350
on that box so then all of a sudden you

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,210
know that there was a technical

32
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,539
compromised maybe that box has nothing

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,630
on it

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,360
maybe it's the PDF to the subway menu

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,699
for the day but a compromise is possible

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,649
so we use that to Train probabilistic

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,350
measures for every vulnerability and to

38
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:31,000
build machine learning models and this

39
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,969
talk is an exercise in that and doing

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,359
that with mostly open source data by

41
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:38,850
combining the threat intelligence piece

42
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,199
and the vulnerability management piece

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,520
so for everybody we just trickled in I'm

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,140
the chief data scientist kind of

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,060
security we have two data sets one is

46
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,979
olive ulnar ability management

47
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,420
application security 4.7 billion

48
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:53,020
vulnerabilities we're going to pull that

49
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,020
out and look at it the other one is IDs

50
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,158
signature hits to open vulnerabilities

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,679
reversals of malware from Symantec

52
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,170
reversing labs Proofpoint email taps

53
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:04,329
essentially anytime an attack is used

54
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,740
and I don't care about the IP address of

55
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:08,049
threat intelligence I don't care about

56
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,260
the threat actor I don't care about the

57
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,440
IOC what I care about is this attack

58
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,540
path was used at a compromise and either

59
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,239
it tried and wasn't successful or was

60
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,530
successful and in machine learning we

61
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,150
call

62
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,100
an outcome measure so we can build a

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,340
whole bunch of models from it but we

64
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,019
don't have to go that far the central

65
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,230
thesis of this talk if you take nothing

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,700
else away it's that these two data silos

67
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,560
describe the silos of security in

68
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,030
general on one side you've got detect

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,340
and respond which is what your sock sees

70
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,840
what your IDs sees all of the actual

71
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,250
events and alerts that we have to deal

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,989
with on a day-to-day basis on the other

73
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,670
side you've got the prevention side of

74
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,110
the house which in my world means

75
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,519
vulnerability management application

76
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,860
security it could be configuration

77
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,420
management it could be I deployed a

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,180
firewall so I think I'm it again at some

79
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,980
future potential risk and while they are

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,470
siloed today they don't have to be all

81
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,940
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pick pieces of

82
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,950
data from each side and show you how the

83
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,600
combination is more powerful than

84
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,179
looking out of the load

85
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,930
further reading after this I'll talk

86
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,700
about a - is our we hired CNT Institute

87
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,130
which is the guys who did the DBA R&J

88
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,410
Jacobson Wade Baker to write some

89
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,060
academic journal papers there's three

90
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,859
reports called prioritization -

91
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,820
prediction where we go and depth into

92
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,350
this there's 110 pages total we can do a

93
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,120
deep dive and all of that is open all

94
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,070
the data is available and then I wrote a

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,810
paper with Dan Gere recently but called

96
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,200
remember the recall which essentially

97
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,060
says if the issue in security is that we

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,070
don't have enough analysts to hire and

99
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,170
there's a shortage then the answer is

100
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,530
automation and what we can automate

101
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,880
depends on bringing threat intelligence

102
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,260
together with the data about the

103
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,700
preventative controls that we can take

104
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,420
to make sure those preventive decisions

105
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,910
are efficient so let's dive in threat

106
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,649
intelligence today is mostly millions of

107
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,720
indicators and billions of events

108
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,739
somebody says I have an indicator what

109
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,810
that really means is they've got either

110
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,040
a regular expression or the presence of

111
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,510
some file indicates that there's a

112
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,519
compromise and that might or might not

113
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,709
be bullish Asst we've got billions of

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,660
events even once you go past your

115
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,329
silence filters the average analyst

116
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,410
spends about six minutes per alert to

117
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,600
make a decision whether or not it's

118
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,510
malicious and that wouldn't be a problem

119
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,579
if it was like 50/50 at half of the

120
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,380
alerts were malicious but the reality is

121
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,110
that maliciousness is actually really

122
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,270
rare this isn't a problem unique to

123
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,030
security this is this happens in disease

124
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,680
this happens in legal document review we

125
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,580
know these problems or this happens at

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,990
incidences of cancer everybody

127
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,188
might have a screen and say you're

128
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,530
positive but that doesn't mean that the

129
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:40,419
test is actually true so what does

130
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,758
malicious in this rare mean it means the

131
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:44,500
data sets are imbalanced only about 2%

132
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,870
of vulnerabilities are ever used in a

133
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,669
successful compromise only about half a

134
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,990
percent of alerts are ever actually

135
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,758
malicious alerts that you have to follow

136
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,919
up on but making that mistake is

137
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,139
expensive because the most expensive

138
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,000
resource we have is time so this is all

139
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,639
about optimizing our time how do we be

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,020
efficient with it well one way is to

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,180
combine those two datasets I was talking

142
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,340
about here you're looking at two and a

143
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,210
half years of reversing labs data there

144
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,799
are 46 million events alerts attributed

145
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,508
to malware here all of them are

146
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,830
successful in that they are already on

147
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,569
the box and then we figure out how the

148
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,810
malware got in there and this is just

149
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,729
the subset of malware that is tied to

150
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,219
vulnerabilities the size of each

151
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,229
rectangle you see there is the number of

152
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:28,569
unique malware samples attributed to

153
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:32,139
that vulnerability each box represents a

154
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,610
CV and the color density is the number

155
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,400
of successful exploitation 'z that you

156
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,719
see on that vulnerability so a couple of

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
things become immediately really

158
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:43,090
apparent here one is that the one with

159
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,460
the most malware sample is a CVD 2010 25

160
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,318
68 that top left over there and from the

161
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,539
detected response side of the house it

162
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,009
would seem like that is the most

163
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,659
malicious vulnerability in the world

164
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,520
it's got tons of variants it's hard to

165
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:00,460
detect it'll split by your filters if

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,378
you're not updated but we've seen 73,000

167
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,750
successful explanations on it and if

168
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,979
you're not looking at how often

169
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,270
somebody's actually been compromised in

170
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,830
that if you don't have the metadata from

171
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,150
the outcome measures you might think

172
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,460
this is the most important vulnerability

173
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,429
out there but the reality is that 2012

174
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,979
Oh 185 has only two malware samples but

175
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,419
in the past two and a half years 300,000

176
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,639
successful compromises have occurred on

177
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,490
that vulnerability so combining those

178
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,440
lenses what do I fix and how many alerts

179
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,909
is it generating is what's allowing me

180
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,169
to make these distinctions between is

181
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:33,669
this actually malicious is this risky

182
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,529
but that's just to in the details the

183
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:40,448
real takeaway here is that you've got

184
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:43,060
299 CVS here and maybe 20 of those boxes

185
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,339
are responsible for 90% of the

186
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,260
successful alerts that you see which

187
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,160
means that if you're remediated 20

188
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,409
their abilities out of your environment

189
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,510
your analysts no longer have to deal

190
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,010
with 46 million alerts on the sock side

191
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,810
they have to deal with 2 million and

192
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,730
they're not taking six minutes perler

193
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,930
they might take 30 and there'll be a lot

194
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,670
more efficient and effective with their

195
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,080
time and they won't miss anything so the

196
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,060
idea is that there's a feedback loop

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,770
here where the decisions we make on the

198
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,300
preventative side need to be filtered

199
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,500
through the lens of are we helping the

200
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,010
rest of the security team be more

201
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,840
efficient

202
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,570
what's our outcome well if our outcome

203
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,280
is reducing number of alerts so that

204
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,010
when we do see alerts we can take the

205
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,030
time to investigate them then

206
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,659
vulnerability management should not be

207
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,010
about Patch Tuesday or CBS s or I heard

208
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,870
in the news that this thing is going to

209
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,840
be a really big deal it should be about

210
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,970
what types of vulnerability is which one

211
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,859
specifically does my threat intelligence

212
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,220
tell me are likely to cause an alert in

213
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,330
my enterprise so over the past five

214
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,590
years we've seen eight billion

215
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,789
successful alerts through this data

216
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,799
collection that we do at Kenna we've

217
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,140
seen we got it from Proofpoint

218
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,070
reversing labs a back door into the

219
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,979
alien vault product icy sands storm

220
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,310
center most recently recorded future all

221
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,480
of those are an alert happened and we

222
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,130
know that that alert was successful and

223
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,240
compromising the vulnerability forty six

224
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,100
million of those are attributed to

225
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,650
malware and that constitutes twenty

226
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,780
eight thousand unique malware samples so

227
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,039
think about that you have to have 28,000

228
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,570
different signatures deployed in carbon

229
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,510
black or in silence to block all those

230
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,969
or you can remediate 299 vulnerabilities

231
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,960
and that is only possible if the threat

232
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,910
intelligence is feeding your

233
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,830
vulnerability management program and not

234
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,590
living in the silo of detected responder

235
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:24,370
let's go deeper that's just malware so

236
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,770
our goal is to reduce risk to stop the

237
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,210
probability of a vulnerability actually

238
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,210
causing a compromised in our environment

239
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:34,090
and all I have to do about that is look

240
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,228
at data we don't have all the data in

241
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,880
the world but this is what we know about

242
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,470
vulnerabilities today when a

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,520
vulnerability is discovered it takes

244
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,140
some time for it to become public

245
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,909
sometimes it never does if it's such

246
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,620
expensive zero-day most of the time it

247
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,319
does and it gets up into mitre and then

248
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,970
into nvd when it gets public when it

249
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,100
gets published we get a bunch of data

250
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,010
about it we have metadata that is the

251
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,860
description the reference links the CVS

252
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,450
s core the platform enumeration so which

253
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,860
specific versions of specific products

254
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,740
are affected and the weakness

255
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,600
enumeration

256
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,970
is really just this is this type of

257
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,930
expectations buffer overflow it might be

258
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,880
information leakage who knows but what's

259
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,920
important to recognize is that all of

260
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,260
that metadata is really just somebody

261
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,729
writing up the vulnerability it is no

262
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,230
different than a blog post of somebody

263
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,300
describing I know how to compromise the

264
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:24,620
specific software when you think about

265
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,469
what cbss is it's six or nine depending

266
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,700
on how deep your cbss scoring goes

267
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,010
categorical variables that are text

268
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,010
mined out of a description is the servo

269
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,620
quote code execution is the axis vector

270
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,660
local or remote they don't test the

271
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,610
vulnerability to do that a bunch of

272
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,410
people seven at the national

273
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,520
vulnerability database will read the

274
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,439
description of the submission from

275
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,840
Microsoft or from a white hat hacker

276
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,790
however that vulnerability was found and

277
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,020
then assigned values to those six

278
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,020
variables and that's what we use to make

279
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,400
our decisions and so that's the preview

280
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,860
for the talk it's that those six are

281
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,630
insufficient but we no longer have to

282
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,340
manually assign variables to them that

283
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,290
text data the richness of that text

284
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,760
document is what we need to analyze in

285
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,640
order to make decisions about the risk

286
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,870
the vulnerabilities posed but thankfully

287
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,340
the description is not all we have

288
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,540
because the rest of security has spent

289
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,610
20 years creating a whole bunch of

290
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,110
sensor data and that data is what we use

291
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,150
on the sock side and that data is what

292
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,460
guides our threat intelligence for

293
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,650
events or for things can happen to a

294
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,570
vulnerability after it's published they

295
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,370
don't have to happen the big in the

296
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,020
first is that somebody like Qualis or

297
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,790
rapid7 or tenable can write a signature

298
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,560
for it which means that when you run

299
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,089
that scan on that agent you can detect

300
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,390
the presence of that vulnerability on a

301
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,070
box and then we know that that

302
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,569
vulnerability exists in a customer's

303
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,360
environment for us it means that you

304
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,730
know that that box is affected by it

305
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,380
then an IDs or an IPS vendor can write a

306
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,780
signature to detect the exploitation of

307
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,550
that if they do and we see it exploited

308
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,810
in the wild then we know that an event

309
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,599
occurred which is related to that

310
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,219
vulnerability somebody can publish an

311
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,720
exploit for it which means that anybody

312
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,010
can go grab that code and use it that

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,140
could be in Metasploit that could be an

314
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,120
exploit DB that could be on a black hat

315
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,220
exploit kit this is why we have threat

316
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,960
intelligence to identify those and then

317
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,520
somebody can release a patch for it

318
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,780
which means that the mitigation exists

319
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,210
that's just upgrading the software or

320
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,720
maybe someone off patch and then that

321
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,580
patch can or can't be

322
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,740
so what's interesting here is that those

323
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,270
first two a vulnerability existing and

324
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,330
us knowing that it's exploited in the

325
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,470
wild we don't know if the signature was

326
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,120
written at all all we know is that the

327
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,980
bull near ability exists so in my data

328
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,510
if I see a vulnerability I know that a

329
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,700
signature was written for it if I don't

330
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,140
see it maybe nobody has that

331
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,050
vulnerability maybe Qualis didn't read

332
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,540
the sudden trio and so armed with this

333
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,189
data which is every vulnerability is a

334
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,380
document describing a problem I need to

335
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,760
figure out which ones are risky I know a

336
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,350
couple things about them sometimes

337
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,270
people have them sometimes they get hit

338
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,100
sometimes people write exploit code for

339
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,620
them and sometimes patches exist what

340
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,880
can I learn about them well the typical

341
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,649
thing that you hear is that

342
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
vulnerabilities are increasing more and

343
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,890
more getting released every day and that

344
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,860
does seem to be true this is the volume

345
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:01,709
of CVS over time except that these

346
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,149
spikes aren't random in 2005 that boost

347
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:04,709
that you're seeing is that they

348
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,020
automated the vulnerability of

349
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,339
submission process mitre and n VG used

350
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,050
to have one person accepting those

351
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,160
vulnerabilities all of a sudden they got

352
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,140
a team that could accept more

353
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,250
submissions their capacity went up but

354
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,899
all of those vulnerabilities still

355
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,029
existed that's just that they had a

356
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,440
problem with the backlog so all of a

357
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,930
sudden were two different cadence the

358
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,880
little spikes up to 1.2 K that you see

359
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,680
is actually two rogue researchers went

360
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,120
wild and started writing SSH bugs and

361
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,319
every tool that they could find even

362
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,790
though it really should have been one of

363
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,230
ulnar ability and they had no quality

364
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:36,510
control in the data in 2017 what

365
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,650
happened is anybody realized that they

366
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,939
couldn't handle all the submissions

367
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,730
themselves and they created the can

368
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,680
process certified numbering authority

369
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,339
some backwards way of making that

370
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,839
acronym

371
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,180
so essentially Microsoft can submit

372
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,830
their own CVS now and so can a white hat

373
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,540
hacker if they've done a good amount of

374
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,459
submissions before and so it can bug

375
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,800
crowd and so can about 30 different

376
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,170
entities and that list is growing and

377
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,959
growing and so all of a sudden there are

378
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,130
more vulnerabilities coming out Qualis

379
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,449
is not keeping up with writing the

380
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,520
signatures for all those vulnerabilities

381
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,260
and not all of those vulnerabilities are

382
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,970
actual risks attackers only use a small

383
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,920
portion of them and only a small portion

384
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,130
of them are actually effective so which

385
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,709
ones are when we slice all of the

386
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,550
vulnerabilities in that data side it's

387
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:20,219
121,000 CVS in the national

388
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,199
vulnerability database go way deeper

389
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,680
into this graphic and the prioritization

390
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,350
to prediction report Volume one

391
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,910
available online there's a PDF but

392
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,740
essentially when we look at that threat

393
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,990
intelligence data of what has an exploit

394
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,759
on what's being hit and we overlay that

395
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,189
on top of all of the national

396
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,470
vulnerability database we learned that

397
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,179
77% of sea bees have never had an

398
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,009
exploit written for them and have never

399
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:45,499
had a successful observed exploitation

400
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:47,629
that means that those vulnerabilities if

401
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:49,220
you're remediating them do not pose a

402
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,079
risk to your environment the only way to

403
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,279
exploit them is this your day perhaps

404
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,040
they're not even detected on your

405
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,230
systems whatsoever so most of the risk

406
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,550
is concentrated in the 24% of

407
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,259
vulnerabilities on the right hand side

408
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,439
of this thing am i doing right and left

409
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:05,990
wrong yes

410
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:08,839
21% have a published exploit which means

411
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,790
there's an entry and exploit DB or show

412
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,329
dad found some blog post that says

413
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,800
something about it or Metasploit or

414
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:17,300
dsquared Eliot or canvas have a

415
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,579
published exploit for this thing we know

416
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,199
about it but that doesn't mean that

417
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,459
exploit has ever used that doesn't even

418
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,229
mean that it could work because people

419
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,459
submit things to exploit DB all the time

420
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,529
that never work they're just proof of

421
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:31,939
concept they're not automated weaponized

422
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:33,589
exploits 1.8 percent of those CVEs

423
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,269
have actually seen successful

424
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,740
exploitation in the wild and this is

425
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,300
what I mean by maliciousness is rare

426
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,730
the goal of owner ability management is

427
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,839
not to fix every vulnerability nobody

428
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,790
has the time to do that we all have

429
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,899
millions the goal is to remove the ones

430
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,730
that pose the most risk to your

431
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:50,509
environment and we need to identify that

432
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,220
1.8 percent really precisely so this

433
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:54,050
could be the end of the talk if we would

434
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,110
want it to just fix every vulnerability

435
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,609
that exists today in our environments

436
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,199
get the data I just told you the people

437
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,819
where you can get it over lay it over

438
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,529
your environment remediate that 1.8

439
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,069
percent you're done except it doesn't

440
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,809
work that way

441
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,069
it's a stochastic process attackers are

442
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,839
developing new exploits new

443
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:11,029
vulnerabilities are coming out we need a

444
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,309
process for identifying what is it about

445
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,629
a vulnerability that makes it a risk to

446
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,100
our environment or makes an attacker

447
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:18,949
likely to use that vulnerability

448
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,990
successfully the problem actually gets

449
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:22,368
even more precise when you look at which

450
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,470
vulnerabilities we can see in our

451
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,879
environment at all remember I said we

452
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,980
can only detect a vulnerability if

453
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,779
Qualis or grap it 7 or 10 above right a

454
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,249
signature for it well it turns out the

455
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,660
only right signatures for about 30% of

456
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,490
vulnerabilities in the national in our

457
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,469
ability database for 70% of them we just

458
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,300
don't know and we'll never see them so

459
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,270
this each square is about a thousand

460
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,990
CVEs and this is looking at 4.6 billion

461
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,720
vulnerabilities that exist live today on

462
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,680
enterprise systems across 400

463
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,990
enterprises of those 5000 are ones that

464
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,050
a scanner has identified on a network

465
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,270
and we see an exploitation associated

466
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,500
with that vulnerability the rest the

467
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,090
blue that you see there is everything

468
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,560
that a scanner has identified that has

469
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,330
never been observed to have a hit on it

470
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,609
which means that if your vulnerability

471
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,980
management practices let's remediate

472
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,320
everything on Patch Tuesday something

473
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,760
like 80% of your work is remediating

474
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,190
vulnerabilities that don't actually pose

475
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,439
a risk to your environment when you

476
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,420
might be missing ones that are

477
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,670
everything you see on the right-hand

478
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,469
side of this thing our vulnerabilities

479
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,120
that we have some data about some of

480
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,470
them have been used in exploitation but

481
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,020
your vulnerability management scanner

482
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,150
does not and so that asset inventory

483
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,470
cmdbs become the way that you address

484
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,930
those kinds of risks it's not their

485
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,250
mobility management let's talk about how

486
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:41,800
we figure out what it is that we should

487
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:44,600
be remediated well today we use cbss and

488
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,939
this is an interesting chart you've

489
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,490
probably seen a lot of charts of cbss by

490
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,380
the vulnerability or navd breakdowns but

491
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,120
what you have not seen is what it looks

492
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,189
like in the wild an actual customer

493
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,600
environments take 4.6 billion

494
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,430
vulnerabilities grouped them by their

495
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,220
cbss scores and this is the chart that

496
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,349
you get the top grey bars are how many

497
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,020
of each kind we've ever seen in a

498
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,970
customer environment so you've got 650

499
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,740
million cbss nine vulnerabilities that

500
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,350
are out there today across those four

501
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,920
hundred enterprises you've got about 540

502
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,439
million

503
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,870
CVS those tenable their abilities and

504
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,260
the dark blue here are those

505
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,489
vulnerabilities that actually have an

506
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,339
exploit or have seen a successful

507
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,900
exploitation I'm going to let that sink

508
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,540
in for a while what that really means is

509
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,960
that if your process is to remediate

510
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,030
cbss ten vulnerabilities 17.6% of those

511
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,370
that are out there in the wild are ones

512
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,370
that are attacker actually cares about

513
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,469
the other 80% are waste of your time

514
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,060
identifying which of those CVS those ten

515
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,470
vulnerabilities are actually a risk to

516
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,830
your environment is what we're going to

517
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,000
do today but if you zoom out of this

518
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,129
chart and take a look at it

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,950
no strategy that uses CV

520
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:58,940
ss gets you better than 20% efficiency

521
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:01,820
so CB SS 5 CB SS 7 it doesn't matter

522
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,400
which one you pick these bucketing Zin 2

523
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,530
scores of CB SS are not giving us enough

524
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,840
precision to be able to identify with

525
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,330
anything better than 20% efficiency what

526
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,320
we should be going after so you know the

527
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,330
best that you can do here is just

528
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,490
remediate the CB SS fives you're fixing

529
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,090
information disclosures a

530
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,920
disproportionate percentage of those

531
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,020
have exploitation have exploits out

532
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:27,200
there but that's not a strategy that's

533
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:29,330
throwing darts at them all it's not

534
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,740
enough to talk about the vulnerabilities

535
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,060
themselves though it's we need to talk

536
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,950
about what it is that we're actually

537
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,590
doing and what attackers are doing to

538
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:40,340
figure out what the right strategy is

539
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,080
when we look at what goes unpatched this

540
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,850
graphic is really interesting and in two

541
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,389
slides we'll look at the flip side of it

542
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:50,629
which is what is getting patched but 18%

543
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,880
of java vulnerabilities remain open only

544
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,830
7.2 percent of acrobat vulnerabilities

545
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,750
remain open only three percent of

546
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,879
Windows 10 abilities remain open what

547
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,650
does that mean if you really think about

548
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,730
it think about how easy it is to patch a

549
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,050
Windows 10 app on their ability how

550
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,760
difficult it is to patch a Java

551
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,770
vulnerability it means we're going down

552
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,510
the path of least resistance we do what

553
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,830
vendors enable us to do and go down to

554
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,200
Microsoft we're making it super easy to

555
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,340
deploy a patch but that doesn't mean

556
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,840
that we're addressing risk that means

557
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,330
that we're doing what it what's easy to

558
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,169
do in our environment attackers though

559
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,020
don't think that way

560
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,030
this is a chart that shows the timeline

561
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,190
from the prime to vulnerability was

562
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,200
released to the time that we saw the

563
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,510
first exploitation on that vulnerability

564
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,290
out in the wild and so this isn't a lot

565
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,930
of data but breaking them down by

566
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,909
products tells an interesting story

567
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,350
Apple and Mozilla and SSL

568
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,940
vulnerabilities will take over a hundred

569
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,500
days to see the first exploitation after

570
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,210
the release of the vulnerability what

571
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,430
does that mean that means that attackers

572
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,810
aren't figuring out new vulnerabilities

573
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,920
and writing exploits for those products

574
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,139
it means that they're looking for the

575
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,610
national vulnerability database figuring

576
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,410
out ways to exploit notable owner

577
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,260
abilities and that process takes time it

578
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,630
takes software development and only then

579
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,310
do we see those attacks when you look at

580
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,640
Adobe though it's completely different

581
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:06,139
it might take it might come out before

582
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,910
the vulnerability does that

583
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,200
it might come out three days after it

584
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,090
might come out five days after but if

585
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,580
you look at those bars that's the 25th

586
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,010
and 75th percentile Adobe is somewhere

587
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,669
between three and forty something days

588
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,559
for the median exploitation time line

589
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,830
and if you look at the very middle of it

590
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:28,460
they look in at about 21 days so if your

591
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,049
SLA on criticals is 30 days you already

592
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,910
blew it for every adobe vulnerability

593
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,049
remediated those are already being

594
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,230
exploited by the time you've met that

595
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,580
isolate if you look at Microsoft this is

596
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,470
all over the place right it looks the

597
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,120
same as the grand total you've got some

598
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,830
things that are being exploited in seven

599
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,449
days 14 days you've got some things that

600
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,949
might take a year and that's because

601
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,299
Microsoft isn't a specific enough

602
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,890
breakdown it's a humongous vendor

603
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,299
something like an I accessible nerve

604
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,429
ability might get popped in seven days

605
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:53,720
something that requires user interaction

606
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:55,250
like a PowerPoint or an office

607
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,740
vulnerability might take 90 days to

608
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,780
develop an effective exploit so what

609
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,980
that what this data tells me is that I

610
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,870
need to go deep I need to break it down

611
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,890
buy more products and we're gonna do

612
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,469
that later but the takeaway here is that

613
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,940
attackers don't think about your

614
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,620
environment your assets or your

615
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,179
vulnerabilities in terms of cbss they

616
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,010
think about what can we pop quickly and

617
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,169
if your SLA czar then based on those

618
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,400
risk criticality buckets they're not

619
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,870
aligned with what attackers are doing

620
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,299
you should be meeting Adobe in seven

621
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,918
days Adobe criticals in seven days Apple

622
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,629
criticals in 90 days is fine

623
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,280
you're still meeting the mark based on

624
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:32,179
that threat intelligence data that's

625
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,250
telling us what it is actually risky if

626
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,690
we look at what we're actually patching

627
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,360
and how quickly we're doing it it does

628
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,220
not align at all with what attackers are

629
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,939
actually exploiting so if you look at

630
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,330
this

631
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:46,820
Green is the top 25% of performers blue

632
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,918
is the median and red is the bottom 75%

633
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,330
of performers so it takes 14 days to

634
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,280
patch the average Microsoft loner

635
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,699
ability unsurprising everybody does a

636
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,590
good Patch Tuesday cadence but those

637
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,049
that perform poorly take about 130 days

638
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,570
for Google which when you think about

639
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:03,889
what's Google from Qualis counterblow

640
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,020
necess it's really crumbling their

641
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,360
abilities takes about 15 days for the

642
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,679
top performance 63 for the median and if

643
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,439
you go further down you're looking at

644
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,380
Cisco and Oracle we're in the 125 200

645
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,790
for the average performer maybe a year

646
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,200
to patch that vulnerability because

647
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,520
those might be critical systems it might

648
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,760
be difficult it might require

649
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,129
code rewrites what's the story here we

650
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,809
do what is easy if a vendor enables us

651
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,429
to easily deploy patches those are the

652
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:29,809
patches that we're going to deploy that

653
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,820
does not mean the risk is concentrated

654
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,678
there it's really funny about this chart

655
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,689
is that if you look at the top

656
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,220
performers what this chart is telling

657
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,980
you is that people will deploy a

658
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,780
Microsoft Patch Tuesday patch faster

659
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,120
than somebody will restart their laptop

660
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,889
in an enterprise environment Chrome will

661
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,510
auto update if you restart right so it

662
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,730
takes 15 days for people to patch a

663
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,260
chrome vulnerability it could not be any

664
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,720
easier if you click the Update button

665
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,309
but we deploy Microsoft patches faster

666
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,179
than we do that which was mind-blowing

667
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:00,830
to me all this to say good on those

668
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:03,230
vendors to make it easy like Red Hat

669
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,850
Debian Microsoft Google every vendor

670
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,950
should have that responsibility but it

671
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,178
is our responsibility to figure out when

672
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,440
something is out-of-band when something

673
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,240
is difficult how much effort should be

674
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,610
putting into it so let's think about

675
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,860
what I've really covered so far what

676
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:18,199
I've really covered is how efficient can

677
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,639
we be with our time how much effort do

678
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,050
we really need to put in when it's

679
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,450
difficult to remediate a vulnerability

680
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,860
what I haven't covered yet is how do we

681
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,510
cover all of the risks that are out

682
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,850
there because you can be really

683
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,320
efficient and really effective if you

684
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,520
just remediate one vulnerability a year

685
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,520
that's the right one but that doesn't

686
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,110
mean you've addressed any risk so think

687
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,360
about those two concepts as I go through

688
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,699
the next thing which is am I using my

689
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,290
time efficiently am i putting effort

690
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,429
towards the things that require effort

691
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,899
towards the vulnerabilities that are

692
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:48,110
hard to patch propose a huge risk to my

693
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,900
environment what does that mean in the

694
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,250
real world so let's say you've got this

695
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,020
is actually real data this is a

696
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,910
synthetic sample that I pulled from five

697
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,980
kind of customers and I just randomly

698
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,750
chose assets and then combined them if

699
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,429
you pick 26,000 s that's a random you

700
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,140
get about 3.2 million vulnerabilities

701
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,780
tells you something about vulnerability

702
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,950
density today in most enterprises and if

703
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,559
you think about how many alerts that

704
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,540
enterprise sees best estimates I got

705
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,220
from like besom surveys are for 10,000

706
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,379
assets you might see 300 million alerts

707
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,150
a year or so maybe a billion here of

708
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,530
course you're not addressing every alert

709
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,820
you probably have a bunch of rules and

710
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,470
filters and some of Sheen learning

711
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,700
software in place and so you're

712
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,770
addressing 10% of those that's still a

713
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,890
100 billion alerts so if you address

714
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,418
that through the lens of the sock you

715
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,679
spend six minutes per alert you need a

716
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,640
lot of people you need to hire a lot of

717
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,110
people that's really difficult

718
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,510
but let's say we want to address

719
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,830
the risk of malware for that environment

720
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,160
through the lens of vulnerability

721
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,270
management to make the Sox life easier

722
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,280
3.2 million vulnerability is only

723
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,200
sixty-four thousand of them are malware

724
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,970
exploitable as of today and of those

725
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,190
only twenty two thousand our remote code

726
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,700
executes about malware exploitable of

727
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,900
those only fourteen thousand are on

728
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,230
popular targets which is what I call the

729
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,580
top 5% of software essentially if you

730
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,350
look at all of the vulnerabilities that

731
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,330
we've scanned into that 4.6 billion data

732
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,980
set I look at the ones that occur most

733
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,110
frequently because if I'm an attacker

734
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,990
that's a target of opportunity for me so

735
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:12,049
the risk probably resides there so we

736
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,730
got 14,000 100 malware exploitable r/c

737
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,340
vulnerabilities on things like Oracle

738
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,650
Java Microsoft and popular targets but

739
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,689
the real solution is that there's only

740
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,940
92 patches that you have to apply across

741
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:26,090
this enterprise to remove the risk of

742
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,860
malware exploitable vulnerabilities from

743
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,959
your environment thereby reducing that

744
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,860
hundred million alerts to significantly

745
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,270
less allowing you to focus on the rest

746
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,620
that real-world example will sink a lot

747
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,720
better if you actually look at your own

748
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,149
data if you grab a slice of like what's

749
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,770
my DMZ look like in Qualis how much of

750
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,090
that could actually have a piece of

751
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,950
malware associated with it

752
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,570
what of it is a remote code execute

753
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,429
about how much work does it take to

754
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,600
slice that out what you're doing there

755
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,220
is you're not threat modeling you're

756
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,750
risk modeling which is I think the

757
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,270
natural extension of what vulnerability

758
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:59,480
management goes so the solution to a

759
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,250
problem of 44 million alerts is you can

760
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,480
fix those 44 million alerts and keep

761
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,940
addressing them over time or you can

762
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,590
address the root cause which is only 299

763
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,260
vulnerabilities and if you think about

764
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,899
this chart that's 299 vulnerabilities

765
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,090
across 400 customers across two and a

766
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,640
half years nobody in this room has all

767
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,470
299 if you overlay this data over your

768
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,179
own environment you might have 50 of

769
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,380
these you might have 40 of these because

770
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,000
you're not running all the software that

771
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,070
all of these folks are running and so if

772
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,840
you remove those 40 vulnerabilities you

773
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,428
know that none of these 44 million

774
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,418
alerts are gonna pop up again and

775
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:31,669
everything you're seeing is something

776
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:35,419
new not related to that everybody's job

777
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:36,919
becomes much easier so that's the deep

778
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:39,140
dive into the data and we don't have a

779
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,140
lot of time left gonna spend 10 more

780
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,250
minutes on one chart kind of tying it

781
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,059
all together and then I'll leave room

782
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,440
for questions

783
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,570
couple concepts I talked about one was

784
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,919
efficiency which is are you wasting time

785
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,100
air you're mediating things that don't

786
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,389
pose a risk one is coverage which is are

787
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,830
you addressing all the risks in your

788
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:59,590
environment you can think about it this

789
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,029
way if I've got a hundred machines and

790
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,709
one of them is infected which is

791
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:05,859
probably the case maliciousness is rare

792
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,440
and every day I walk up to my sis and I

793
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:10,809
say nothing's infected my accuracy is

794
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,840
99% every time but I'm doing a terrible

795
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:15,908
job so accuracy is a terrible metric

796
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,830
which is what CB SS really tries to get

797
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:19,330
us towards is being accurate with how we

798
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,939
describe the vulnerability how we assess

799
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,320
it so we need to be efficient which is

800
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,659
to say when I make a prediction about

801
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,549
something it should be right so let's

802
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,379
say I said let's remediated of these

803
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,179
machines let's say I think 10 of them

804
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:33,658
are infected but only one of them really

805
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:37,029
is that my efficiency is 10 percent

806
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:39,279
right if it's if in those 10 that one

807
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:40,989
machine is contained and 10 percent is a

808
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,580
pretty terrible efficiency because if I

809
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:43,960
had more data if I was smarter I would

810
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,869
say let's only remediate five of those

811
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,710
then my efficiency would be 20% of

812
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:52,389
course it's very easy to say let's

813
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,039
remediating irritability if you know

814
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,449
that vulnerability is at risk like let's

815
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,889
fix struts then your efficiency is a

816
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,899
hundred percent but you've only

817
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:00,668
addressed one of the tons of thousands

818
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:02,109
of risky vulnerabilities out there and

819
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:03,730
so this is the trade-off and this is not

820
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:05,199
a trade-off specific security this is

821
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,049
the trade-off in all machine learning

822
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,580
problems if you do a google search it

823
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:11,619
can give you a really precise results or

824
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,999
it can give you a lot of results gives

825
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:14,109
you precise results it's gonna miss some

826
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:15,639
of the information you're looking for it

827
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,049
gives you a lot of results it's hard to

828
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:18,609
filter that noise it's hard to remediate

829
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:20,980
them if you look at breast cancer

830
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,629
screening we do mammograms first because

831
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,980
we know that we're gonna get more people

832
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:25,988
than actually have breast cancer and

833
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,580
then we do a biopsy follow-up to make

834
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:29,710
sure that it's correct if you look at

835
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,259
legal document search review we'll look

836
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,989
at a cachet of documents and say let's

837
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:36,970
have the lawyers look at 5% of them but

838
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:38,679
why don't we do that in security because

839
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,509
what we're doing is we're saying here a

840
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,950
bunch of documents about vulnerabilities

841
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:43,989
let's have our security team look at all

842
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,539
of them instead of adding that slice up

843
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:48,309
front so what is that slice what should

844
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,320
that slice look like well if you want to

845
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,599
cover 100% of the risks that's a really

846
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,980
easy vulnerability management strategy

847
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,989
you just have to remediate every

848
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,360
vulnerability in your environment the

849
00:28:55,989 --> 00:28:59,070
problem with that is it's expensive

850
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,979
so there's a natural trade-off between

851
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,770
having a lot of coverage and being very

852
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,510
efficient and where that trade-off is

853
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,490
all about modeling is all about data is

854
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,580
all about your confidence in knowing

855
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:14,190
that something is riskier or isn't but

856
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,290
it's certainly not saying let's fix cbss

857
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,350
time take a look at the CBS s tenth

858
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,840
bubble in the left-hand side it's close

859
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,179
towards the bottom below it is a dotted

860
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,760
line that dotted line is random chance

861
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,200
if I randomly pick one of the hundred

862
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,520
and twenty one thousand vulnerabilities

863
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,890
in the national vulnerability database

864
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,870
and I throw a dart at it and then I

865
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,460
remediated that in my environment the

866
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,560
probability that I'm remediating

867
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,450
something that has an exploit or a

868
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:44,010
successful exploitation in the past six

869
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:46,050
months is twenty one percent so random

870
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,960
chance if I'm randomly picking

871
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,280
vulnerability is 21 percent efficiency

872
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,960
cbss ten if I randomly throw a doubter

873
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,790
one of those you get about twenty three

874
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,440
percent efficiency which is not a

875
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,879
significant improvement and it means

876
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,350
that eight four out of five

877
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,720
vulnerabilities that your remediating

878
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,149
our waste of your time and now look at

879
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,280
where it is on the coverage chart it's

880
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,980
got about I think seven percent coverage

881
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,330
so seven percent of the known exploited

882
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,830
or exploitable vulnerabilities out there

883
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,570
are CBS s tons if you're immediate all

884
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,649
of them you'll have seven percent

885
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,780
coverage with your vulnerability

886
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,320
management strategy how do we do better

887
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,050
than that

888
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,790
well if you do CBS F seven plus you do

889
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,610
significantly better that dot is

890
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:26,550
somewhere in the middle and that's about

891
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,740
33% efficiency and 55 percent coverage

892
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,149
which means one in three of your actions

893
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,650
is actually effective at reducing risk

894
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,480
and you've got fifty five percent

895
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,220
coverage about half the things that we

896
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,960
know are risky are removed from your

897
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,260
environment but look at the size of that

898
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,840
bubble and this is where it really hits

899
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,400
the pavement the size of that bubble is

900
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,139
how many vulnerabilities or how much

901
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,660
effort you would have to put in to

902
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,620
achieve that strategy and think about

903
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,240
what I'm saying there well first of all

904
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,830
it's about 30,000 sea bees do you have

905
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,930
to remediate out of an environment to

906
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,389
get to that which might take years for

907
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,860
the average organization but second what

908
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,860
am I really saying there I'm saying

909
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,840
here's a slice of the data we fix this

910
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,250
we don't fix this when we get here we've

911
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,490
achieved some level of efficiency in

912
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,350
coverage that's not a very stochastic

913
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,720
strategy for a very stochastic market

914
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,820
all of these all of these little bubbles

915
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,559
and there's a deeper dive and the

916
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,689
prioritization to prediction reports are

917
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,639
these kind of dogmatic strategies that

918
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,080
we use we look at the certain lists we

919
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:25,740
do Microsoft Patch Tuesday we patch

920
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,049
these vendors we do criticals we do CBS

921
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,480
s 7 plus and Microsoft Boehner abilities

922
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:32,220
all of those are slices of the data in

923
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,649
half that tell us we fix this we don't

924
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,789
fix this and how much time it takes to

925
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,258
get there how much effort you have to

926
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:39,120
put in to achieve that strategy is

927
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:41,340
largely ignored because we don't think

928
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,000
about efficiency we think about is the

929
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:48,600
strategy accurate so what's a better way

930
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,220
well if you assign a probability of

931
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,559
exploitation to every vulnerability

932
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,480
that's not that hard to do not gonna

933
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,370
cover it here but essentially this model

934
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,799
is just the logistic regression using

935
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,059
only publicly available data if you look

936
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,500
at the players description report we

937
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,500
actually go through where the data comes

938
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,570
from it's all open source six or seven

939
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,269
variables are enough it doesn't even

940
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,519
matter which model you use what matters

941
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,440
is that you have a model that is giving

942
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,960
you a score for that vulnerability that

943
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,210
score being do I think this is risky or

944
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,419
not and so if you look at the top left

945
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:24,149
here the it's a efficiency is close to

946
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,259
100 and that's because we just know that

947
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:26,610
some things are being successfully

948
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:28,830
exploited we don't need to look at the

949
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,689
CBS s or the Patch Tuesday you know that

950
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,100
JBoss from 2010 is still being actively

951
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,200
exploited in the wild and people are

952
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,428
getting popped on it the conference that

953
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,750
that is a risk to your environment is a

954
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,899
100 percent go ahead and remediate that

955
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:42,029
but as we drop off as we go further we

956
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,830
might not have that data but we do have

957
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,809
all of the document information about

958
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,000
that vulnerability all of the words in

959
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,740
that description all of the CVS s sub

960
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,899
scores whether or not those exploits

961
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,360
exist and we can use that to try to

962
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,889
predict exploitation that data that I

963
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,990
talked about from the stock environment

964
00:32:55,889 --> 00:33:00,209
of here's an event it was tied to see ve

965
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,789
you already have all that data at all of

966
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,620
your environments it exists and Splunk

967
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:06,570
it exists in your IDs every time you've

968
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,340
seen an alert so what is it about a

969
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,789
vulnerability that increases the

970
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,769
probability of causing an alert if you

971
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,570
build that model no matter how simple it

972
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:18,059
is what you get is you get granularity

973
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,049
you get the ability to capacity plan so

974
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,760
this one has a trade-off between

975
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:22,559
efficiency and coverage you can see what

976
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,240
I was talking about earlier in that if

977
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,760
you want to have 60% coverage

978
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,130
now gonna have 100% efficiency we just

979
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,200
don't have the data to cover 60% of the

980
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,480
node exploits out there because we don't

981
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,980
have exploitation data on them but you

982
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,290
do know that you'll have about 80%

983
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,580
efficiency in doing that and you know

984
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,260
how many folks you have working on

985
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,370
vulnerability management and you know

986
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,230
how many vulnerabilities you can

987
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,659
remediate in a given time frame and you

988
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,160
know that by taking that approach you

989
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,990
know your capacity you know how long it

990
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,370
takes you to get there you might want to

991
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,650
walk down that line you might want to

992
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,959
say first I want to cover 20 percent of

993
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:56,610
my known risks out there with 90 percent

994
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,350
efficiency and then go to your system

995
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,149
and say if I want to hit 80 percent I

996
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,740
know that we're gonna get down to 40

997
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,150
percent efficiency I know I'm gonna need

998
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,280
this many more hours there's many more

999
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,530
folks that'll take this long so being

1000
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,020
able to plan for your capacity is all

1001
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,369
about having granular measures of the

1002
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,850
confidence that something is risky and

1003
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,470
focusing on the actual risk which means

1004
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,179
measuring your efficiency measuring

1005
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,069
whether you're wasting time having an

1006
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,899
outcome measure the good news is is that

1007
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:26,669
everybody has that outcome measure it

1008
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:29,159
exists in the sock we've got 20 minutes

1009
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:31,649
left a lot of questions to drive the

1010
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,359
rest of this but natural questions would

1011
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:35,159
be what is it about a vulnerability that

1012
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,859
causes the risk how do you get this data

1013
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,379
all of those I can dive into more

1014
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:42,270
important is that this isn't kind of

1015
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,889
security data everybody has this data at

1016
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,300
their enterprise right you have your

1017
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,850
vulnerability management scans you have

1018
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,200
your asset scans and your sock has all

1019
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,509
the data about what they've seen hit in

1020
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,129
the past two years so build that outcome

1021
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,010
measure of what they've seen hit and

1022
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:58,500
make sure that a can't happen again be

1023
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,790
you use that threat intelligence to

1024
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,900
predict what it is that you should be

1025
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:06,060
remediating on the vulnerability

1026
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:09,350
management side that's it well kind of a

1027
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,350
twenty minutes of questions go ahead

1028
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:32,840
yep it is bad I yes

1029
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,320
yes

1030
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,119
I'm pulling up my RSA talk to have

1031
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,119
something to show you what we do this

1032
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,660
maybe I don't have the slide that I'm

1033
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,660
looking for

1034
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,930
let me talk about it first so when we

1035
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,369
talk about that vulnerability what is it

1036
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,960
about it that makes it likely to be

1037
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:39,259
exploited there's a couple of things

1038
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,819
there if you look at maybe I know how to

1039
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:45,680
get this so we recently published a blog

1040
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:48,619
with what we think is going to happen

1041
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,999
that vulnerability the probability that

1042
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,739
that model that we have running

1043
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,029
internally is about 90% that'll be

1044
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,109
successfully exploited and there's

1045
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:56,470
already exploits out there

1046
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:59,749
the reason is which products it effects

1047
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:02,058
it's only 12 of them and all of them are

1048
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:03,738
ones that have successful exploitation

1049
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:06,499
and at least one of the vulnerabilities

1050
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:08,239
in any given patch the second reason is

1051
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:10,069
if you look at the description itself

1052
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,970
it's not about the CBS s core but

1053
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:13,549
although it is high

1054
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,319
it's that it is arbitrary code execution

1055
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:17,809
by remote attacker those words are

1056
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,038
indicators and it's that we know the

1057
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:21,170
proof-of-concept exploit code already

1058
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,640
exists so those are the things that even

1059
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,230
before enemy G is published a

1060
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,609
vulnerability you can look at the

1061
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,279
description of that vulnerability and

1062
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:30,019
know that if it has these keywords and

1063
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,940
it effects these common platform

1064
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:33,319
enumerations it is likely that attackers

1065
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,720
have an incentive to go after that

1066
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:37,940
vulnerability and this one's actually

1067
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,009
really incredible because we haven't

1068
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,599
seen anything predicted to be exploited

1069
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:44,150
with the confidence of 90% in the past

1070
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,299
year except this one vulnerability 90 is

1071
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,799
actually pretty high for prediction one

1072
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,210
thing to keep in mind is if you're

1073
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,559
looking at that vulnerability it's

1074
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,029
really easy to say yeah somebody's gonna

1075
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:54,829
write an exploit somebody's gonna deploy

1076
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:56,559
this mass because it's remote because it

1077
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:59,269
affects things that everybody's running

1078
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,369
but if you've got a Microsoft patch and

1079
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:03,410
it's got 20 vulnerabilities in there and

1080
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:05,329
one already has an exploit out there

1081
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,799
there's no incentive for an attacker to

1082
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,450
write an exploit for the other 19

1083
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,460
because either you've patched it already

1084
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,319
and that second exploit is a waste of

1085
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,849
time or you haven't and they already

1086
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:16,640
know about the one that they could use

1087
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:18,049
so things like that come into play pre

1088
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,220
nvd of course you don't know what else

1089
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:22,299
is in that release or what else is

1090
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:27,189
remediated what I wanted to pull up

1091
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:27,190
which I will find I promise is

1092
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,279
is which factors effective ulnar ability

1093
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:46,799
and I'm not maybe I won't be able to

1094
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,990
find it I think which essentially when

1095
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,700
you look at the breakdown of what is it

1096
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,899
that causes exploitation of

1097
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,899
vulnerability let's see

1098
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,009
I'm just gonna play this slide because

1099
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,270
that's the one we were talking about

1100
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,700
when you look at those factors that are

1101
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,200
indicative the best way to do it is to

1102
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,399
look at the text data of the

1103
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,290
vulnerability what I was alluding to

1104
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,480
when I started this is that the

1105
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,490
description of a vulnerability and it

1106
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,380
doesn't just have to come from NBD could

1107
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,509
come from the actual advisories that NBD

1108
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,130
links to is a whole bunch of text that

1109
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,320
describes a couple things it describes

1110
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,570
the mechanism of action it describes

1111
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,310
whether or not it's detected in the wild

1112
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,480
or not words like in the wild or

1113
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,450
keywords in the description that are way

1114
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,210
more valuable than any cbss score it

1115
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,830
describes how it was found what the

1116
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,990
likely effect is Microsoft will

1117
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,000
anticipate about it for a long time you

1118
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,799
pull all those words in and you just do

1119
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,270
something as simple as tagging all of

1120
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,250
the words pulling them out so what we do

1121
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,740
is we pull out 250 different words that

1122
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,990
are usually common and vulnerabilities

1123
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:54,859
things like buffer overflow remote code

1124
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:57,890
execution or dot C dot H together and a

1125
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:59,900
word document as importantly each one of

1126
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,509
those becomes a feature in a simple

1127
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,800
regression model either it has it or it

1128
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,480
doesn't if it has arbitrary code

1129
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,280
execution chances are you're logistic

1130
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,040
regression is much higher and then on

1131
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,470
top of that you add in so I think of it

1132
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,720
as the text information then there's the

1133
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,750
reference information so who's talking

1134
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,520
about it you have one Advisory link from

1135
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,320
Microsoft or do you have 40 different

1136
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,670
blog posts that anybody's talking about

1137
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,740
which means that people are actually

1138
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,650
working on this thing or we know that

1139
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:31,069
it's already exploited in the wild so

1140
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,390
words references metadata about the

1141
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,980
exploit which you may or may not have

1142
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,690
which is is there a proof of concept out

1143
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,260
there is there something in Metasploit

1144
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,180
already that exists and then I think

1145
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,230
that the next most important thing is

1146
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,720
what what artifacts

1147
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,940
so vendors products common platform

1148
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,740
remediation is a very ignored part of

1149
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,290
vulnerability management but it might be

1150
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,029
the most important one in that if it's a

1151
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,650
Microsoft only vulnerability that

1152
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,630
affects these six products that's

1153
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,580
probably a risky cause it's Microsoft if

1154
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,800
it's a completely different vendor like

1155
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,270
a Wireshark vulnerability it's probably

1156
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,280
not going to have a developed exploit

1157
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,480
but if it affects six different vendors

1158
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,980
and 20 different products you already

1159
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,360
know it's a library of vulnerability

1160
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,310
that's a huge target of opportunity for

1161
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,170
attackers so even just the metadata of

1162
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,759
how many vendors how many products

1163
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:17,140
how many versions is that effect is

1164
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,140
important information in that regression

1165
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:32,660
yes what kind of attacks well depends

1166
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,930
what kind of fishing we're talking about

1167
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,310
I mean user interaction of vulnerability

1168
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,259
is on Microsoft or how most of those

1169
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,759
fishing things work right or on Google

1170
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,590
Chrome or taking compromised of a

1171
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,090
browser you've got things fully

1172
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,220
up-to-date you're much less exposed to

1173
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:49,100
it of course there are phishing attacks

1174
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,750
that requires somebody to log in and do

1175
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,020
a wire transfer and I can't help you

1176
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,020
with that

1177
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,850
right

1178
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,970
so the threat intelligence is that all

1179
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,290
of threat intelligence is what our

1180
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,270
attackers doing and what are those

1181
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:17,640
attackers I'm saying for the

1182
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,050
vulnerability management use case only a

1183
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,150
subset of that intelligence matters

1184
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,830
which is exploit intelligence how

1185
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,960
frequently are we using which attack

1186
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,400
paths what our attacker is actually

1187
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,280
deploying and who's getting compromised

1188
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,960
none of what tells me whether this

1189
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,470
version of PowerPoint is susceptible to

1190
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,450
a crafted pptx or not whether or not

1191
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,330
that attack can actually affect it and

1192
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:41,279
so what I'm saying is in the sock threat

1193
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:45,270
intelligence has many uses such as

1194
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,440
phishing compromised such as Network

1195
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,030
compromised that might not be

1196
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,230
vulnerability based might have an

1197
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,850
indicator of compromise that there's

1198
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,040
some malicious activity happening but

1199
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,380
when it comes to preventive controls

1200
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,060
that help the sock out there's a piece

1201
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,760
of it you can strip out which is not

1202
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,520
about the who or the what it's about the

1203
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,740
how exploit intelligence vulnerability

1204
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,270
intelligence the metadata about how

1205
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,100
frequently these things are used is your

1206
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,390
outcome measure for which

1207
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,049
vulnerabilities you should be meeting in

1208
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,879
the first place

1209
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,440
so you're right there's a whole other

1210
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,700
subset of threat intelligence that's

1211
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,800
useful for this talk in a different way

1212
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,230
but there's a piece of it that we seem

1213
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,180
to keep siloed in the sock there's

1214
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,720
actually way more useful for VM than it

1215
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,720
is for the sock

1216
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,990
yep

1217
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,940
and I actually I've seen his data about

1218
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,530
that so the cost of an exploit is

1219
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,260
something great to throw into a model I

1220
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,700
haven't done that yet but which exploits

1221
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,290
are more effective will give you an even

1222
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,930
better model than just is it going to be

1223
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:07,150
exploited or not like his cost estimates

1224
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,980
as your outcome measure instead of just

1225
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,250
yes or no would be an even better model

1226
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,250
to build

1227
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:28,540
there's a there's a bunch of secret

1228
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,540
sauce here and I'm gonna give it away so

1229
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,319
the naive approach would be to throw it

1230
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,819
at a neural net and get all the features

1231
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,170
that you could get but that would be

1232
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,880
stupid because we actually know some

1233
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,850
things about vulnerability is that and

1234
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,680
you're oh that does not I know that the

1235
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,730
words that matter in a description of a

1236
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,370
vulnerability are vulnerability attacker

1237
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:50,960
product so we have these functions that

1238
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:52,450
we've built ourselves but I guess you

1239
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,880
could do it by just bidding things

1240
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:58,009
called go around so we'll look at boner

1241
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,510
ability and we'll look at the one word

1242
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,920
before it the one word after the two

1243
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,360
words before the two words after the

1244
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,400
three words before the three words after

1245
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,840
it and if you do that for enough words

1246
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,700
that you know are for sure meaningful

1247
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,530
what you're getting our adjectives

1248
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,049
describing vulnerability so we'll have a

1249
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:16,880
feature called vulnerability remote code

1250
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:19,520
execution or product header and then

1251
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,560
those become descriptions of that

1252
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,300
document that are trying to tease out

1253
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:28,520
meaning instead of just category text

1254
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,080
and that's a that's borrowed from legal

1255
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,070
document review so they'll say like

1256
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,200
here's the plate and here's the

1257
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:34,430
defendant let's go around and see what's

1258
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,259
around that and that's what they used to

1259
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:38,259
classify relevant to the case

1260
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,640
I agree

1261
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:13,289
incredibly incredibly I measure I saw

1262
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:16,019
that talk and we measured it as a

1263
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:18,329
baseline so if you don't have any data

1264
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:23,669
and all your remediating is Metasploit

1265
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:25,199
it's your so if you randomly pick up a

1266
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,180
linear Billy out of exploit DB and your

1267
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,670
immediated the chance that is exploited

1268
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,969
as 17% you randomly pick a Metasploit

1269
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:35,699
vulnerability it's 25%

1270
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:37,829
no it's 36% so significantly better than

1271
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:39,660
CBS s10 or any other strategy if you're

1272
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:41,789
just remediate Metasploit if you look at

1273
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,199
the overlap of something that was first

1274
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:44,579
published and I exploit DB then in

1275
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,959
Metasploit some of you looked at the

1276
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,209
proof of concept then developed the

1277
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:52,769
weaponized thing that probability jumps

1278
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:53,999
up to like 45% so there's only a small

1279
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,249
portion of them you're gonna go through

1280
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:58,288
about 600 vulnerabilities that way but

1281
00:46:56,249 --> 00:47:00,328
you're absolutely right that you know

1282
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:01,859
there's also a baseline here there's a

1283
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:03,420
lot we could say a lot about being super

1284
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:06,749
efficient and having a lot of coverage

1285
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,999
but there's a baseline where like if you

1286
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:10,140
have remote code execute about Metis

1287
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:12,390
points across your network somewhere

1288
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:15,959
this is not useful information to you

1289
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,969
you got to go there first and that's a

1290
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,709
much better strategy than saying we fix

1291
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:22,140
criticals within 30 days so much better

1292
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:25,489
strategy is to say we fix all Metasploit

1293
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,489
first and I will think about the rest

1294
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:37,720
in the version 2 of the volume 2 of the

1295
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,550
report we actually have a breakdown of

1296
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,970
measuring Metasploit by itself as a

1297
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,970
strategy

1298
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,720
yes

1299
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:26,299
yeah so that's really astute so nobody

1300
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:28,069
patches a vulnerability people deploy a

1301
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,210
patch a patch might have 20

1302
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,700
vulnerabilities it might have one

1303
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:33,550
vulnerability so the pivot table is

1304
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,470
really how you should look at this and

1305
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,180
I'll attach a link when I post the

1306
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,819
slides we have a report that looks at

1307
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,649
the pivot table which is which patches

1308
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,270
should you be applying because what

1309
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,220
you're talking about is there's like

1310
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,690
ephemeral concept of patch superseded

1311
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,759
ins this one comes first this will come

1312
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:51,440
second but there's no reason why one

1313
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,010
comes first and second other than it

1314
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,990
covers the rest or it came out later the

1315
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,000
risk is actually a really good way to do

1316
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,410
patch superseded ins I know that I need

1317
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,850
to address these three vulnerabilities

1318
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,290
the best way to do that is to play this

1319
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:06,290
patch that addresses those three and a

1320
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:08,120
couple others so we go through how you

1321
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,410
pick the right patch to deploy out of a

1322
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,520
bunch of ones that supersede each other

1323
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,520
when you really want to only remediate

1324
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,290
this vulnerability so let's say you

1325
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,020
could just fix this vulner you could fix

1326
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:19,880
these three maybe this one is not as

1327
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:24,770
risky as you want but this one also has

1328
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:27,050
risk to play this patch instead patch

1329
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:31,970
speed has a really huge effect on

1330
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:33,380
people's coverage and so while picking

1331
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,419
the right vulnerabilities to remediate

1332
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,980
is very important perhaps even more

1333
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,320
important is how quickly can you deploy

1334
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,700
a patch once you've made a decision

1335
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,880
which goes to what's that guy this is

1336
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,879
wrong

1337
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:56,680
right hopefully next year further

1338
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,540
research for us would be to look at not

1339
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,330
remediation rates per product but

1340
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,710
remediation rates per vulnerability so

1341
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:06,250
on average how quickly does somebody

1342
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:08,320
remediate this one CVE and whether or

1343
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,550
not that is a good average or a bad

1344
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,349
average based on what attackers are

1345
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,849
doing and that'll come from things like

1346
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:14,890
that like that data will show up because

1347
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:16,450
people will remediates some Microsoft

1348
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:23,140
phones way later because it requires a

1349
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:29,718
service pack we're good thanks everyone

1350
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:29,719
