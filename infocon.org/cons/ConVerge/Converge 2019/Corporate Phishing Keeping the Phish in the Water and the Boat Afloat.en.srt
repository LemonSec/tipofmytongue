00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,538
they are my greatest support systems and

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,129
the reason that I live every day I'm a

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,840
security awareness lead it's consumers

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,250
energy I've been at consumers energy for

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,750
three years I started in their

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,719
cybersecurity incident response team

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,160
doing blue team activities such as

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,329
malware analysis carbon black detection

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,580
detection and response and then

29
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,070
eventually moved to program awareness

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,369
kept fishing with me from the cyber

31
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,779
security incident response team took it

32
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,830
with me to program wariness to hopefully

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,150
build the program and make it a little

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,070
bit larger so that's what I want to talk

35
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,200
to you guys about today how to keep

36
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,758
fishing as a focus in your company how

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,430
we got it to become how to change the

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,710
culture to make fishing as important as

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,150
it is to us today and of course how to

40
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,500
get it in front of your CEO or your

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,030
executives up there a little information

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,650
so the sharks in the water so phishing

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,030
emails of for those of you that may not

44
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,860
be aware are designed to elude somebody

45
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,229
into giving you information so fishermen

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,689
want your bank account information your

47
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,210
log work log in information any elevated

48
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,279
access that they can get anything they

49
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,009
can get that within some way possibly

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,509
give them money we have three levels of

51
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,909
phishing emails that we focus on at

52
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,579
consumers energy level one is considered

53
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,340
a generalized email it can go to anybody

54
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,110
in the world and in some way relate to

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,610
them it can say it's coming from anybody

56
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,289
in the world it's not targeted to

57
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,049
anything specific these are the emails

58
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:11,430
that fishermen will send out like 10,000

59
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,650
at a time just to get somebody to click

60
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,450
on it level two emails our company

61
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,310
targeted anything that says it's coming

62
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,010
to consumers energy may have a consumers

63
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,880
Energy logo on it say it's coming from a

64
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,679
consumers energy employee

65
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,510
or targeted at consumers energy in some

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,310
way and level three is the spear

67
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,250
phishing emails so targeted at an

68
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,950
individual whether it's executive or not

69
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,660
executive we do keep the keep track of

70
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,549
the difference between spear phishing

71
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,130
emails at individuals and whaling at our

72
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,670
c-level executives and that are at our

73
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:46,840
president of course so upgrading our

74
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,579
rowboat to a yacht in 2015 our level one

75
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,770
click rate which is supposed to be the

76
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,350
easiest email to detect was forty

77
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,790
percent we initially looked at it in our

78
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,739
eyes grew about the size of the planet

79
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,400
and realized we had a problem we wanted

80
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:04,270
to focus on it more so 2016 we ran level

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,650
one campaign emails quarterly to keep to

82
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,450
keep track of how we're doing but also

83
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,920
to try to open up the program and see

84
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,869
where we where we need to be before we

85
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,130
start a huge program on this so we

86
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,280
dropped that level one quickly

87
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:18,310
click rate to sixteen percent we started

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,370
testing level two by about quarter end

89
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,720
of quarter two in 2017 our level two

90
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,300
fish and click rate was twenty six

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,880
percent we knew this was still a problem

92
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,070
as the industry average for level one

93
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,160
was still at 10 percent and level two

94
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,570
being harder emails to detect being at

95
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,690
twenty six percent was a huge issue for

96
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,160
us we knew that the level two phishing

97
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,480
emails were starting to step up as we

98
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,400
had communications with the Incident

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,829
Response Team and they could tell us how

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,940
many level two emails we were receiving

101
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,020
how many people were clicking on them

102
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,120
and if it would have caused us any

103
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,730
issues so we added it to this program

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,230
called a ICP the ICP is the employee

105
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,179
incentive compensation program at

106
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,130
consumers energy and it determines how

107
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,140
much everybody under President or under

108
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,030
c-level exec how much they're gonna see

109
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,589
for their bonus so if we don't meet all

110
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,830
of our sixteen to twenty goals for the e

111
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,230
ICP program potentially you won't get a

112
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,580
bonus so now we're now we're really

113
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,230
focusing on it right we want everybody

114
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,670
to look at phishing and say hey I got to

115
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,950
take this seriously I got to learn more

116
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,690
about it I need to put this in my front

117
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,358
focus we want managers to say I want to

118
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,190
focus at this focus this at my Wars and

119
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,409
Moore's or monthly operating review and

120
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,590
weekly operating reviews it started to

121
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,840
become a regular topic at the daily

122
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,219
operating reviews even and then we

123
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,840
wanted to open up the training programs

124
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,320
to focus a little more on fishing as

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,049
well walking the plank so how we started

126
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,790
was

127
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,740
with the level 1 phishing emails in 2015

128
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,990
in the quarterly emails in 2016

129
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,350
that was our our foot in the door to

130
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,620
kind of show our seesaw our executive

131
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,260
directors that this is a serious issue

132
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,810
as of 2020 eighteen ninety four percent

133
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,030
of cyber security attacks start with a

134
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,010
phishing email ninety four percent so

135
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,119
you think only six percent could be from

136
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,820
you know somebody logging into a

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,280
computer or that they had access to such

138
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,409
as a disgruntled employee or you know

139
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,510
random USB devices but ninety four

140
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,120
percent start already on your network

141
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,310
and then it all it takes is a click so

142
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,770
we defined the problem of what we want

143
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,710
where we want to get to we wanted to get

144
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,859
to 20 percent for twenty eighteen on our

145
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,299
level to click rates and then we wanted

146
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,420
to keep benchmarking our level one

147
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,600
against other industry other industry

148
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,370
companies and how we plan to get there

149
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,070
so we had to lay out in order for this

150
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,600
to be Annie ICP goal for us we had to

151
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,340
lay out an end-to-end process with a

152
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,050
detailed action plan and how we plan to

153
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,469
get from twenty six percent to twenty

154
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,090
percent it was considered a breakthrough

155
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,380
goal so for those of you who don't know

156
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,570
what a breakthrough goal is it's a goal

157
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,770
that you don't have anybody to compare

158
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,060
to and you don't know how you're going

159
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,900
to get there but you know you're gonna

160
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,000
do it my starting the program the number

161
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,940
one thing that I have to bless myself

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,410
for is that I had leadership that didn't

163
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,330
tell me no when I needed to do something

164
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,790
or wanted to do something so if I had an

165
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,859
idea such as doing security fairs or

166
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,420
security lunch and learns where I wanted

167
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,940
to travel the entire state for a month

168
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,070
straight which was exhausting by the way

169
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,350
and go to every location I can get to

170
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,120
within my budget and just tell them hey

171
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,470
this is phishing this is what phishing

172
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,680
is doing and this is what it could do to

173
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,780
you we wanted to train them on what they

174
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,400
could do at home for phishing so helping

175
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,650
them keep their kids and their wives and

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,179
husbands safe we wanted to teach them

177
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,179
what they can do at work and what they

178
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,280
can do when they're doing nothing so

179
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,870
meaning like setting up email inbox

180
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,789
rules when you're when you are doing

181
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,620
nothing with your inbox what ways can

182
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,810
you do or what things can you do to keep

183
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,480
yourself safe so email rules and inbox

184
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,430
setting up blocking for you know certain

185
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,880
domains that you don't like that rules

186
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,440
that we allow our

187
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,250
employees at our company to maintain

188
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,380
every day on top of what we already do

189
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,700
so we had this everybody's most

190
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,110
everybody has heard the same culture

191
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,630
eats strategy for breakfast so what's

192
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,100
for lunch the idea that culture eating

193
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,650
strategy for breakfast is that you can

194
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,780
plan plan plan plan have a budget the

195
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,070
size you know the size the earth do

196
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,530
whatever you think that you need to do

197
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,940
but if your company and the culture of

198
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,309
your company says what we do what we

199
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,110
want your strategies done there's

200
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,550
nothing you can do or the idea is

201
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,930
there's nothing you can do once your

202
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,270
culture says that we don't want to do

203
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,460
that they're not gonna do it however we

204
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,750
serve sushi for lunch and sushi sushi

205
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,180
seems to be the latest dining fad so

206
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,500
luckily everybody ate our sushi it went

207
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,870
across really well with what we wanted

208
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,170
to do and you know right off the bat we

209
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,760
had our sea so on board we had our

210
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,830
president and CEO on board as well they

211
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,099
were pushing it and it was it was a

212
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,750
top-down push from leadership and the

213
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,700
employees got on board a lot faster than

214
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,590
we thought they would so culture eating

215
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,229
strategy for breakfast we want him to

216
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,520
flip that upside down and just say that

217
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,590
you know you can change your culture if

218
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,150
you've got you know the tools and the

219
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,619
support behind you to do it so one of

220
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,500
the ways we changed our culture was

221
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,440
actually creating a mascot called fin

222
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,090
fin is a six-foot shark he is he is on

223
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,760
our wall with like one of the fat heads

224
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,429
for our where we report on our

225
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,039
statistics we wanted to have fun with

226
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,070
with the mascot so we actually actually

227
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,100
has his own show called the fin show in

228
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,620
a rap video it's great so we're now on

229
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,820
season three of fin we have our

230
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,500
president and CEO in the fin show we've

231
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,939
got our executive director we've got our

232
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,440
sea so we did a skit roughly six months

233
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,240
ago we it actually just got launched

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,260
last week of like a talent show so we're

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,820
having a lot of fun with it we're

236
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,730
getting laughs and just getting people

237
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,270
to go to fins sharepoint site which is

238
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,000
he has his own website to see the videos

239
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,170
it also puts in front of them our AICP

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,480
goal so the first thing they see when

241
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,939
they log on to Finn's website is how the

242
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,010
goal is doing where we're at and what

243
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,440
we're gonna do about it there's also a

244
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,770
blog post that my team maintains

245
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,080
so the blog posts include things rules

246
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,380
they can set up in their inbox

247
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,990
for protecting themselves there's a blog

248
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,270
regarding reporting phishing and why we

249
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,980
want to report phishing which I'll talk

250
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,360
a little more on it a bit

251
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,760
there's blog posts about how to keep

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,730
their kids safe things to do at home and

253
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,980
then we regularly post how Finn is doing

254
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,410
and the things that Finn is doing within

255
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,680
the company so changing your culture

256
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,360
yourself is an option but having the

257
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,069
support behind you it's going to change

258
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,650
the culture regardless of your of your

259
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,110
strategy so not saying you should have a

260
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,310
poor strategy but if you think you can't

261
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,830
change your culture I'm here to tell

262
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:48,130
that you can so we had a definitely an

263
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,380
old-fashioned view of computers where a

264
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,060
predominant amount of our employees I'd

265
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,960
have to say about 80% of our employees

266
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,060
our 25-year tenured or more and a lot of

267
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,560
them are set in their ways so you may

268
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,599
have heard some companies say that

269
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,010
somebody that's been there for 10 plus

270
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,690
years it's really hard to change their

271
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,360
ways you can't teach an old dog new

272
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,100
tricks and you can so you have to have

273
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,420
fun with it don't you know walk into

274
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,360
fishing me like this is what you got to

275
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,829
do we need to be strict about it there

276
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,420
is no laughing because it's a serious

277
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,800
matter if you laugh about it people are

278
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,170
gonna enjoy what you're putting in front

279
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,870
of them make fun of yourself make fun of

280
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,150
the company in a acceptable way there

281
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,400
are borders you can cross but you know

282
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,050
change your own culture and don't think

283
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,730
you can there's nothing stopping you

284
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,170
except for yourself if you think that

285
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,310
you're gonna stop that you're going to

286
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,199
be stopped then you're gonna be stopped

287
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,030
another thing we wanted to focus on when

288
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,680
we're doing this this fishing program is

289
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,390
punitive versus positive so are we gonna

290
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,640
feed our fish are we gonna fillet them

291
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,800
you know are we gonna we gonna help our

292
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,050
employees grow or are we gonna fire them

293
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,870
for failing we have a lot of pushback

294
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,790
with especially with leadership that

295
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,500
when they're clicking on too many of our

296
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,240
phishing campaign campaign emails

297
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,960
eventually they should lose access

298
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,910
rights and unfortunately they would like

299
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,670
some of their employees to be fired I'm

300
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:09,640
entirely against it I would hate to have

301
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,930
me walk into a company I don't know what

302
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,339
I'm doing this fishing I don't

303
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,500
understand it entirely and all of a

304
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,060
sudden I'm fired it's not the employees

305
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,070
fault if they don't know what fishing is

306
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,589
or how serious it could be but it is my

307
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,510
job to make sure they know that so if I

308
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,190
tell you know if we have a frequent

309
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,200
clickers program if you click on an

310
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:31,000
email twice or more you're considered a

311
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,040
frequent clicker or freaks for short and

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,260
we have the frequent cooker program so

313
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,680
that we know where we need to focus in

314
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:42,760
2019 beginning of 2019 in January our

315
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:45,160
click rate was 2% above our goal and we

316
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,620
wanted to focus on our clickers to see

317
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,930
why they're still clicking so our goal

318
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,120
for 2018 was the 20% click rate on level

319
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,140
2 emails we blew it out of the water and

320
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,480
hit it hit 7% entirely unexpectedly was

321
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,550
it the culture change we didn't know so

322
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,010
how do you how do you ask your customer

323
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,099
or ask your users what we did that

324
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:09,340
helped them so beginning of 2019 our

325
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,340
goal was going to be set to 5% and in 20

326
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,650
that in January we hit a 9% click rate

327
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,590
so we're already 4% above our goal right

328
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,990
it's 2% last less than what we ended or

329
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,180
2% more than what we ended 2018 but

330
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,400
still 4% above our goals so we started

331
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,260
sending emails I mean yeah we send

332
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,939
emails anyway but we started sending

333
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,160
more emails explaining why they

334
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,020
shouldn't have clicked on the emails so

335
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,969
there's what we call red flags and I'll

336
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,890
talk more about it in a second red flags

337
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,500
of the email and then a survey asking

338
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,390
them why do you think you clicked so the

339
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,850
options of the survey are I didn't see

340
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,199
our red banner which is also I'll

341
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,150
mention in a minute I didn't see our red

342
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,400
banner I was going through my email too

343
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:51,939
quickly I have too much email and not

344
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,760
enough time I thought it was an internal

345
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,900
email the content of the email was

346
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,150
important to me

347
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,520
or relevant to my topics in my job role

348
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,780
or other and give them the option to

349
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,939
tell us why we now run that that email

350
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,890
and that survey every month to see how

351
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,780
it's changing the number one response

352
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,540
that we get is I didn't see the red

353
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,319
banner and I was going through my email

354
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,630
too quickly or I have too much email so

355
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,760
instead of punishing the users for

356
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,470
saying for for clicking on emails we

357
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
want to ask them why because something

358
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,910
in our training isn't right right so if

359
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,710
if I'm training you it's not clicking or

360
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,459
it's not sticking and you're still

361
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,870
clicking

362
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,880
so what can I do to make it better for

363
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,170
you I don't want to punish you I don't

364
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,670
want you to be in trouble you're not

365
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,790
going to get fired but if you're open

366
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,770
and honest with me we can fix this so

367
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,589
the the sonar hits and shark advisories

368
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,410
are our red banners and our reporting

369
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,779
tool so we want them to report the

370
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,890
emails to us when they see you know

371
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,510
something that could be possibly

372
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,880
malicious which would be reviewed by our

373
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,170
cyber security incident response team

374
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,540
and then we also want them to notice

375
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,670
what we call a red banner when an

376
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,490
external email comes into our company we

377
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,040
have a banner at the top that says email

378
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,050
is coming from outside of CMS or seee

379
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,730
use caution before clicking links and

380
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:15,069
attachments we've been running this

381
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:16,149
email banner for seven years now way

382
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,190
before I got there

383
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,170
but when initially when they implemented

384
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,980
the red banner they saw a 10% drop in

385
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,300
the click rate on emails and then we

386
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,029
also implemented the reporting tool

387
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,819
which is tied into our simulator our

388
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,680
phishing email simulator so we know how

389
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,600
many emails are being reported and then

390
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,540
we can also track how many are malicious

391
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,990
non-malicious meaning internal or spam

392
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,520
emails so we want them to report because

393
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,650
of course once we know about that the

394
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,000
email exists then we can do something

395
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,490
about it whether blocking links and

396
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,950
attachments or you know checking for

397
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,209
macros or growing our tools so that we

398
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,610
have better rules set up to prevent

399
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,410
these things from happening and then we

400
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,000
want them to notice the red banner every

401
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,439
time they see an external email to know

402
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,209
that they need to use caution so if

403
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,620
they're not seeing that red banner which

404
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,719
is the main response that we got from

405
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:09,040
our surveys what can we do to change it

406
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,900
so actually next week I have a meeting

407
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,370
to sit down with a new vendor on how to

408
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,410
change our red banner because clearly

409
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,400
it's not working for us right it's been

410
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,930
three years that we're trying to get

411
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,150
this goal going and try to keep it

412
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,489
maintained and we haven't really done

413
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,709
much to change the red banner other than

414
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,420
maybe the wording the location of where

415
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,579
it shows up on your email or the size of

416
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,199
the text we're getting thousands of

417
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:30,729
suggestions from our users in our

418
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,490
surveys of how to change the red banner

419
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,290
so why not do it why not take the voice

420
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,390
the people and do something about it so

421
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,800
that's part of our culture change that

422
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,329
you know I'm not yelling time for

423
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,819
clicking on the email but they're

424
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,500
positive from us is that we're going to

425
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,030
do something

426
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,140
their voice they're not just saying you

427
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,660
know giving us feedback negative

428
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,160
feedback most the time and we're not

429
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,420
gonna do anything with it I want their

430
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,980
negative feedback because I want to know

431
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,050
what I'm doing wrong or what I could do

432
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,920
better so to have that mindset that

433
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,699
negative feedback is positive feedback

434
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,079
regardless of what it is

435
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,610
I even had someone say that our

436
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,440
trainings are too fun and therefore are

437
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,720
not trainings and I said that's the best

438
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,340
negative feedback I could get right so

439
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,880
you learned something from it get 100%

440
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,620
on his quizzes or his knowledge checks

441
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,510
so he learned something but he's having

442
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,190
too much fun and that's not something I

443
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,610
want to stop because if everybody's

444
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,840
having a lot of fun why not so we keep

445
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,640
the red banner out there we're going to

446
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,470
change it soon we're using the voice of

447
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,500
the people one thing we can't do is

448
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,420
require people to set a time block for

449
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,280
going through their emails so the other

450
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,479
response was I have too many emails or I

451
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,660
don't have enough time to go through the

452
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,390
email I have and you know we can't stop

453
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,010
people from going through email too fast

454
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,650
you know I can't that's a behavior

455
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,600
change for one person and we've got

456
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,220
14,000 employees so I can't force

457
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,830
somebody to set a time block for their

458
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,950
email but I can set a company

459
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,000
requirement or talk to the come to the

460
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,370
proper teams that set the company

461
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,930
requirements for emails to reduce how

462
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,480
many emails are allowed to be sent in

463
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:05,310
the company so a small portion of the

464
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,199
emails that we use the two and a half

465
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,179
million emails that are go through our

466
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,560
email servers each month a small portion

467
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,120
of them are internal communications

468
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,220
there's like impact notification system

469
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,869
down notifications weather warning

470
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,540
notifications change freeze

471
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,060
notifications just a small chunk but

472
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,970
then there's also as you guys know the

473
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,610
marijuana bill passed there's a ton of

474
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,690
emails on that so we you know that's a

475
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,939
notification that we'd had to let

476
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,160
everybody know that regardless of the

477
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,830
laws this is still our rules this and

478
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,950
that so and things similar to that was

479
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,659
like what we call Patty's post or

480
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,840
president/ceo her name's patty poppy she

481
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,420
has her own blog and it's called Patty's

482
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,909
post to set updates for us on things

483
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,440
that are happening within the company

484
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,350
maybe information about our stocks or

485
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,169
about our enterprise

486
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,100
company but she sends out emails for

487
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,410
those periodically

488
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,480
the original discussion with

489
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,710
communications the communications team

490
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,710
was that those emails were going to be

491
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,240
monthly however if we're getting a

492
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,740
complaint that we have too many emails

493
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,020
and not enough time to go through them

494
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,299
why should they be monthly unless it's

495
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,700
necessary of course if it's something

496
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,610
urgent why can't we cut back on the

497
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,309
emails we send so I even used to send

498
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,959
emails periodically from Finn saying you

499
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,760
know hey it's Valentine's Day Finn

500
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,990
doesn't want to be your Valentine we

501
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,740
don't want your cooties please don't

502
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,240
click on the phishing emails and I had

503
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,309
to cut back on sending those so I had to

504
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,610
take you know eat my own dog food as my

505
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,899
executive director Jim likes to call it

506
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,129
when I'm telling people hey we have too

507
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,809
many emails we should stop sending

508
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,559
emails that also means I have to stop

509
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,970
sending emails

510
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,470
however the phishing emails are gonna

511
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:52,630
continue sorry guys I bumped it so you

512
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,950
know we have to eat our own dog food on

513
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,350
that change the way that we're sending

514
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,730
emails we can't force people to stop

515
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,918
looking at their emails or to take time

516
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,480
to look at their emails but we can force

517
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,730
enforce new rules on when you're allowed

518
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,260
to send email communications how often

519
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,990
who's allowed to send them so we also

520
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,210
cut back on who was allowed to send or

521
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,580
who is allowed to send to the exchange

522
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:16,750
group all users which is like I said

523
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,210
14,000 users we got I used to be able to

524
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,179
send to that and I got that taken away

525
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,039
again eating my own dog food but the it

526
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,020
was cut back to executive directors can

527
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,809
send and then specific people with

528
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,549
certain rights can send all exchange

529
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:32,440
users so we're slowly cutting back and

530
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,570
how many emails that people receive to

531
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,710
try to try to take that feedback in and

532
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,330
change things for our users before I

533
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,850
take any questions that went a lot

534
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,230
faster than I planned it to before I

535
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,020
take any questions I just want to point

536
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,549
out that anytime somebody comes to us

537
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,760
with feedback we did have somebody that

538
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:53,408
said hey I don't like your program I'm

539
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,360
not gonna get feedback on your survey

540
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:56,890
surveys are crap

541
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,299
anytime somebody gives you a negative

542
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,890
response in the survey it gets

543
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:02,230
overloaded by the by the positive

544
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,940
response I take the positive responses

545
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,460
with a smile of course because I love to

546
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,929
be complimented who doesn't but the

547
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,450
negative feedback is the ones that I

548
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,190
like to focus on I want your negative

549
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,989
back the fact that you have the

550
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,850
empowerment to tell me hey I hate your

551
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:17,590
program your training sucks because it's

552
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,959
too much fun that's what I want to hear

553
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,850
so I want to you know develop our

554
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,850
training programs in a way that will

555
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,189
most likely fit most of it like the the

556
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,168
criteria of employees that we have but

557
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,460
you know we want we want to have that

558
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,980
feedback so that if something's not

559
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,139
working for you then we can use it we

560
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,059
can use that feedback to change things

561
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:39,908
whenever you're sending phishing emails

562
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:42,908
or my my team of sending phishing emails

563
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:45,369
at least once a month we get an email to

564
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,690
our reporting box saying hey I really

565
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,699
hate how much emails you're sending me

566
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,799
phishing emails are crap I know you're

567
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,419
sending them and then we looked at his

568
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,879
click rates and he was a frequent

569
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:56,919
clicker so I'm like of course you hate

570
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:59,019
my emails because now I'm sending you

571
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,230
more emails because you're clicking on

572
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:03,940
my emails yeah it's like clicking just

573
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,700
because they can and we did have the

574
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,799
response in 2017 where we started the

575
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,720
surveys and the lunch and learns

576
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,009
traveling the state we had someone say I

577
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,149
just click on all the emails because I

578
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,429
can and I want to see what you're gonna

579
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:17,830
do are you gonna fire me are you gonna

580
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:19,779
keep your word if you get fired over

581
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,689
phishing emails I am NOT gonna put my

582
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:25,149
name on it we have had teams that that

583
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,609
come to us and I speak to the executive

584
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:29,859
officers and the president twice

585
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:32,320
annually and more upon the request about

586
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:34,689
what we're doing with the program and

587
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,100
they every time we want to start firing

588
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,679
people we're gonna start taking away

589
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,059
rights and every time I have to shoot

590
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,590
them down you know that's like the

591
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,779
mother and me like these are my little

592
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,678
tiny humans that I get to love so I

593
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:49,419
don't want to fire anybody but also you

594
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,739
know the the feedback with with the

595
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:54,850
officer review just that you know they

596
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:57,519
have or they have given their support

597
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,619
for our fishing program and what we've

598
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,919
done with it and I have yet to be told

599
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:05,019
no again but I think the reason we've

600
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,149
been so successful have yet been told no

601
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,499
it's probably not a good thing but the

602
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:09,789
reason we've been so successful is

603
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:11,889
because we focus on the users and the

604
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,539
voice of the people so the main points I

605
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:15,699
want to hit with you guys is don't think

606
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,749
you can't change your culture fishing

607
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,700
should still be a number-one topic

608
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:21,070
because it's 94% of all cyber attacks

609
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,330
start with phishing if you think you

610
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,159
can't do phishing or if you have

611
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,809
questions about your fishing program

612
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,840
I'm always available my twitter handle

613
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:30,879
is 6-foot 64 feel free to take a picture

614
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:42,280
of that is there any questions I can

615
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:46,559
answer before I keep rambling yeah yes

616
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,520
so we do have email rules set up and I

617
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,678
don't know if I can talk specifically

618
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,889
what tools we use but we do have tools

619
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,690
set up that will block emails as they're

620
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,740
coming in if they have certain rules on

621
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:01,150
them so documents that have like they

622
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,520
read through the documents we actually

623
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,179
did a phishing campaign one time where I

624
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,559
had sent the Google Docs email right

625
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,179
after that scam started happening so

626
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,549
those who don't know about the Google

627
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,140
Docs emails it was an email that they

628
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:15,490
literally copied and pasted a Google

629
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,370
Docs email like you've received a Google

630
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,480
document click here to view it and then

631
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,918
just change the link of where it was

632
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,299
going like it was one of the most

633
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:27,490
legitimate looking phishing emails we've

634
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:29,049
seen and because we already knew you

635
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,000
know that that a lot of our employees

636
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:32,049
use Google Docs and we already knew what

637
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,480
the email looked like and what it

638
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:36,250
contained we had set up blocks for that

639
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,260
email and then I went to go send a

640
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,919
phishing email based on the Google Docs

641
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:45,970
email and it like crashed so I had like

642
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,799
a 54% click rate within about an hour of

643
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,120
the email being sent out and then we

644
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,650
realized it's because our tools were

645
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,979
actually looking at the Google Docs and

646
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,950
and our protections were keeping us more

647
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,390
safe than I was trying to train so

648
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,710
positive negative on that I didn't get

649
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,090
to train for the Google Docs email but

650
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,340
the positive was that we already had our

651
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,709
tool set in place so I can't speak to

652
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,059
specifically to what we have as I don't

653
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,490
know what tools I'm allowed to list off

654
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:14,428
but we do have tools in place to protect

655
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,429
before emails get to us the question

656
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:30,080
right this the same email every month

657
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,390
it's about to fit it's the fifth option

658
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,820
we give them the option of you know I

659
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,140
don't care like that or the I just I

660
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,560
wanted to click on it see what happened

661
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,230
first because we did have people tell us

662
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,730
that that that was their response but no

663
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:53,540
it's not the first time on the list

664
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:57,080
didn't know and actually we get the

665
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,480
predominant besides you know the number

666
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,889
three on the list is other so we get

667
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,160
more responses of people saying excuse

668
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,840
me if people saying other than we do of

669
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,240
like the I'm not trip I'm not

670
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,590
well-trained enough which I mean it's

671
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,120
it's funny that we put that in the email

672
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,409
nobody says and I'm not well-trained

673
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,810
enough because then they think that even

674
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,040
though it's an anonymous survey that all

675
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,980
of a sudden I'm just gonna like bombard

676
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,470
him with training but it's number three

677
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,090
is other and they're all there the three

678
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,370
responses that are highest are spread

679
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:29,050
out with one to two options in between

680
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,050
them yes

681
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:39,399
we do so we have advocates in each

682
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,110
organization and what we were doing

683
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,940
before was just sending leadership like

684
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,699
their monthly because we get like a

685
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,870
giant fight of CSV file from our tool of

686
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,790
who clicked who didn't click and who

687
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,830
reported and where they report to where

688
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,870
they clicked from all that detailed

689
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,240
information and we were sending it to

690
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:58,179
advocates and the advocates would

691
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,130
disperse it amongst leadership and now

692
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,990
what we've done with we're partnering

693
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:06,610
with security journey who's there based

694
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:09,490
in North Carolina they have built with

695
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,929
us the security leader in a box train or

696
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,880
leadership training and then meeting in

697
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,960
a box training so the security leader

698
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,190
training is actually something we're

699
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,650
also going to push out to our board

700
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,840
members and it's they're just short

701
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,790
videos of how to keep yourself safe how

702
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,179
to keep your family safe and then

703
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,950
information packets beyond that but then

704
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,410
the leader or the meeting in a box

705
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,820
training is for leadership to take to

706
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,490
their organizations we get a ton of

707
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,659
questions and you know I want to talk to

708
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,710
my company or I want to talk to my

709
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,050
organization about this and I don't know

710
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,520
what to say what can I say and how can

711
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,830
you help me so we can literally hand

712
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,790
them a folder of tools with PowerPoint

713
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:48,730
slides flyers information decks or or

714
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,050
note cards for them to train their

715
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,550
people but then also to get themselves

716
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,950
more up-to-date on the most recent

717
00:26:51,550 --> 00:27:07,450
things happening with security did you

718
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:09,520
have a question somewhat yeah so we have

719
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,560
like SharePoint pages that the whole

720
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,170
company uses everybody gets their own or

721
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,750
every department gets their own and we

722
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,490
also have I connect so rather than

723
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,900
sending a whole bunch of these like hey

724
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,490
this is what's happening we're doing a

725
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,650
March for like the March for warmth

726
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,890
we're doing a lot of it on the I can i

727
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,840
pages blog posts I don't have statistics

728
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,700
on how well that's reacted but I do know

729
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,709
that like a ton of people showed up for

730
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,150
like the walk for warmth so somehow

731
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,280
they're getting that communications and

732
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,860
then we're also pushing it out to the

733
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,629
advocates so if we have like we had

734
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,189
training coming out that we wanted to

735
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,180
let the advocates know about we have let

736
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,680
the advocates know that there's going to

737
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,420
be a blog post regarding the training

738
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,210
and to send it out to their users rather

739
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,860
than

740
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:55,789
eight thousand fourteen thousand emails

741
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:58,029
we just send it to 30 people right right

742
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,029
right

743
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:06,189
so we try to push it through the

744
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,189
grapevine basically other questions yes

745
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:19,940
so it's it's a little bit of both so

746
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,469
when we do credential and put emails we

747
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,299
don't see what they put in and that's on

748
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,590
purpose obviously because then we would

749
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:28,700
have a file of somebody's credentials

750
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:30,049
somewhere but some of them put in

751
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,779
credentials and some of them click and

752
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,908
then exit luckily with our simulation

753
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,740
training tool if you stay on the

754
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:38,330
credential input page long enough you're

755
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,679
put your push through to our automatic

756
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,350
education which is like a two-minute

757
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,840
demo video that we created with Finn

758
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,889
then you know then they know that it was

759
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,509
obviously a phishing email because

760
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,668
sometimes like if I click on an email

761
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:51,019
and I know it was an internal email but

762
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:52,759
the page it took me to looks a little

763
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,559
suspicious I just sit there and stare at

764
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,730
it so then you know in that case they

765
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,279
would know that it was a phishing email

766
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,509
but I don't know exactly how many of the

767
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,370
people who just click through for fun

768
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:05,960
have clicked on credential and put

769
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:07,039
emails however we do have when when we

770
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,330
have people that are just clicking

771
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,740
through a whole bunch of emails after

772
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,899
they click five or more emails which

773
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,340
sounds like a really high number after

774
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:17,059
they click five more emails we use them

775
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,559
in person so at two emails you get an

776
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,629
hour-long training called in the life of

777
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,580
an analyst three or more emails we

778
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:24,049
contact your supervisor or your manager

779
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,389
supervisor letting them know it's a

780
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:27,559
problem for more emails even especially

781
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,870
if you haven't taken your training

782
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,690
because the training is based on one

783
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,239
they can do it we contact the next level

784
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,409
up then we actually did all the go all

785
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,870
the way last year to senior vice

786
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:40,340
president on one person and then at that

787
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,600
point that was their corrective action

788
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:46,340
to take care of it was nothing punitive

789
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,168
on our part so beyond making sure that

790
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,580
that they're not just clicking through

791
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,100
to have fun we want to have contact with

792
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,110
them so with with the email survey after

793
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,789
one-click contacting supervisors after

794
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,129
another click we're trying to cut down

795
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,900
on the fun of phishing but the fun of

796
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:05,919
them clicking on phishing emails not the

797
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:07,330
I'm having can't stop won't stop right

798
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,050
right

799
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,540
luckily that's what the incident

800
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,889
response team is for right so incident

801
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,200
response we like to call our last level

802
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,640
of defense we have the tools that are

803
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,160
supposed to stop emails or stop them

804
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,360
from getting through to malicious site

805
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,920
our users are supposed to be our next

806
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,080
line of defense of deciding not to click

807
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,490
on the email but at that point we will

808
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,580
reimage a machine if they do click on

809
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:34,670
legitimate phishing emails does that

810
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:36,830
answer your question not it not on my

811
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,560
watch I'm not gonna fire you I also

812
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,550
don't have the right to fire people so

813
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,710
although I walk around all day like

814
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:46,010
you're fired you're fired I fired my

815
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:57,160
boss one time but yes we don't we don't

816
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:57,160
fire it's up to the supervisor yes right

817
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,600
communicating changes to our users okay

818
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:34,450
so some of it we included in what we

819
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:35,889
call the secret oh he's an advocate okay

820
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,850
hey Darcy when you get back to your

821
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:41,200
computer so some of it we included in

822
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,899
what we call the security ocean and this

823
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,700
is the training that two of the of the

824
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,250
trainings within the security ocean are

825
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,770
fishing trainings or security trainings

826
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,660
alone but most of them are broad

827
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,900
spectrum security for what we call level

828
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,250
1 beta level 2 puffer level 3 barracuda

829
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,870
and that's gonna be rolled over the next

830
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,540
five years we include in there what

831
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:04,030
we've changed to help the users so that

832
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,850
and it's required some of the 11 of the

833
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:10,690
20 modules in there are required and

834
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:13,060
then the feedback in it with because

835
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,980
they get a what we call it Net Promoter

836
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,770
email every month for if they liked the

837
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,800
training and and what we could change

838
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,810
about it but we conclude in the training

839
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,370
points that how we've changed security

840
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:27,280
as a program and how we've changed the

841
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:29,260
security awareness program and then we

842
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,600
keep with the blog post we do expect our

843
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,770
advocates to push that out because of

844
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,899
the fact that we're trying to eliminate

845
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,490
how many emails we send every month we

846
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,140
don't let that I let everybody know on a

847
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,930
broad spectrum or a mass communication

848
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,770
that we've changed these things but when

849
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:47,410
we do have a peal box in our email boxes

850
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,090
the members of our team monitor it where

851
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,290
if they have a question or if they want

852
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,060
an update on it they can communicate

853
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,470
with us any time if I can't answer their

854
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,450
question I'm gonna find somebody who can

855
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,520
so and that's communicated through the

856
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,840
fin website as well that anytime they

857
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,220
have a question or they need an update

858
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,169
on something they can contact us in the

859
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,850
PIO box so rather than doing the broad

860
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:09,600
the broad communication we try to keep

861
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,600
it as one-to-one as we can yeah

862
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:23,070
so we actually have the tool we use is

863
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,809
through coal fence fish me reporter so

864
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,999
when they see an email they think it's

865
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,799
suspicious we ask them to use their gut

866
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:30,929
feeling of course there's we have a list

867
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,609
of red flags that I can go over but

868
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:33,960
they're just hit that report fishing

869
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:36,418
button and it didn't it's got like a

870
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,859
shape of a fish icon on it so that if

871
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,970
they have a suspicious email or think

872
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,859
they have a suspicious email they can

873
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,239
report it fishing that goes directly to

874
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:43,168
the cyber security instant response team

875
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:45,119
or they look at any links and

876
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:46,409
attachments in the email to see if

877
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,259
anything is malicious and black is

878
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:50,519
needed the red banners are the red

879
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,429
banners the red flags that we tell them

880
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,859
to look for include email address is not

881
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:57,029
matching signature lines and this is

882
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,139
part of their required training when

883
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:59,909
they're hired in and also as their

884
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,488
annual training for these red banners

885
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:04,980
but to look for the email address not

886
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:07,409
matching signature lines hovering over

887
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,309
links that go to websites to see if it's

888
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:12,929
actually taking it where it's going to

889
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:15,119
go great grammar and spelling errors to

890
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,230
see if it's an external email like

891
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,490
saying it has the red banner honor but

892
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,589
it's claims it's coming from an internal

893
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,779
link we do have a lot of people receive

894
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:23,308
invoice emails so if there's someone who

895
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,109
doesn't receipt doesn't usually receive

896
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:25,950
invoice emails or receiving an invoice

897
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,569
from somebody they don't normally

898
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:31,109
contact that's considered a huge red

899
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:33,449
flag we did have a user receive an

900
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:35,668
invoice about ten minutes after they had

901
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,859
paid an invoice to that company and they

902
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,259
we email them saying hey your invoice

903
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,879
has been paid and then she got about ten

904
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,319
minutes later back or ten minutes later

905
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,989
got an email back saying hey we need you

906
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:48,299
to pay this invoice so luckily she saw

907
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:49,918
all the red flags in the email called

908
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:51,869
the company and said I just received

909
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,009
another invoice from you I'm not due to

910
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:54,510
pay you again until I received my

911
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,740
invoice next month why did you send me

912
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,089
another invoice and that's when that

913
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,439
vendor was see realized that they were

914
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:00,210
breached and somebody had been

915
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,109
monitoring their inbox to see who had

916
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:07,010
been communicating with them and

917
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:07,009
responding with more invoices yes

918
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,960
minimum once a month and then

919
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,630
spearfishing and whaling campaigns as

920
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,150
requested by supervisors and we do

921
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:21,340
that's the level to emails and level one

922
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,530
is to keep benchmarking across the

923
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,300
industry we do it quarterly currently we

924
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,410
are best in industry with a quick rate

925
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,790
of one percent the average for the

926
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,670
industry average click rate is roughly

927
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,890
10% for level one and our reporting rate

928
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,100
is currently between 60 and 70 percent

929
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,379
investment industry or the next industry

930
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:46,049
average for that is between 40 and 50

931
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,050
percent yep what's up

932
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,910
yes so a lot of people use the report

933
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:01,090
fishing button as a delete button and we

934
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,020
do we had one person report a thousand

935
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,390
emails in one month

936
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,920
which at that point is ridiculous and we

937
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,480
had a mass communication sent out where

938
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,310
everybody was hitting reply all because

939
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,960
instead of BC seeing the company they

940
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,250
just see seed them so when you hit reply

941
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,670
all it was sending an additional eight

942
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:17,080
thousand emails every time so of course

943
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,780
we shut that down as fast as we could

944
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,119
but we have people who reply all it

945
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,310
overloads the C cert team with having

946
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,599
their not reply off with reporting when

947
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,190
it they should have deleted so we had

948
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,070
meetings one-on-one with them and we

949
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,119
call them frequent reporters and then we

950
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:42,250
try to teach them what a delete button

951
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:44,170
is a question we want to so yeah we're

952
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,640
starting the program with that actually

953
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,650
I had a meeting on Monday and I have

954
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,480
another one next Wednesday for what we

955
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,180
call a Service Catalog and we want to

956
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,470
get into small business owners and help

957
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,720
them become more secure with

958
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,250
cybersecurity and with physical security

959
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,129
as well so what we're gonna start is a

960
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,960
security catalog where they can come to

961
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,130
us with help and then we'll will

962
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,240
initially start by going to them and

963
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,220
saying hey we have this available are

964
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,770
you interested so that they can keep

965
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:17,980
their users safe and in return keep us

966
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:20,410
safe right yep right exactly so so we're

967
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,880
trying to jump jump for lack of better

968
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,348
terms jump the gun on it and start with

969
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,349
our small business owners yes

970
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,850
so fishing performance it's one of

971
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,680
between 16 and 20 depending on how many

972
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,660
are agreed to that year by our

973
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,060
executives and through the what we

974
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:43,270
called world-class performance team if

975
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,950
we meet all of those goals

976
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,790
ideally we'll receive all of our bonus

977
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,410
right if we meet and I'm not I'm not

978
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,240
totally sure this is like examples I

979
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,430
don't know how they calculate this but

980
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,779
if we meet half of it I'd you know the

981
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,379
theory is that you'll receive half of

982
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,450
your bonus

983
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,920
however it's weighted so if you if I

984
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,890
miss the fishing goal by one percent

985
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,110
that doesn't entirely take away their

986
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,970
bonus part of the fishing it will deduce

987
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,380
it because I we are so close to the goal

988
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,730
there's just a little more we could do

989
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,950
so we're gonna take away a little bit of

990
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,710
their bonus not give them all of it but

991
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:17,950
if we meet all 16 of those goals the EIC

992
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,020
pea goals then you get your whole bonus

993
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:26,680
so fishing is just part of the EIC P

994
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:29,610
program I'm not entirely sure but organ

995
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:36,460
thank you in the organizational level

996
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:39,040
other questions yes back the whole

997
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,380
company not including most contractors

998
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,550
so we have to have in the contract which

999
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:48,130
I had two executive officers on Tuesday

1000
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:51,400
tell me that the contracts can be

1001
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,560
changed but we fish contractors on an

1002
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,480
as-needed basis if their contract were

1003
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,980
like lays out that we can test them

1004
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,410
other than that we had we test the

1005
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,850
entire company on a monthly basis which

1006
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:06,149
is roughly between eight nine thousand

1007
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:06,150
people I'm sorry

1008
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,339
and forwards or something like it's like

1009
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,960
saying hey warning the phishing emails

1010
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,960
that was obvious what you're speaking of

1011
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,550
right

1012
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,919
so it's more of like bowing on our hands

1013
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:35,169
and knees and saying please don't we can

1014
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,490
see when people forward but now they're

1015
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,319
getting smart and screen chatting the

1016
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,390
emails and then sending a new email

1017
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:42,069
communication so they're like loop

1018
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,328
holing things which you know it's like

1019
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:44,589
cool that they can figure that out but

1020
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,109
like not cool because then they're not

1021
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:50,170
getting trained right so we call that

1022
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:52,450
herd immunity and the herd immunity is

1023
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,160
great not great so if it was a real

1024
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,419
phishing campaign or like a real

1025
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,649
phishing email and they're saying hey

1026
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,329
don't click on this if you received it

1027
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,220
it is real phishing I just got the

1028
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,170
confirmation from Caesar or something

1029
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,109
just happened to me that's awesome and

1030
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,700
we don't want to tell them 100% that's a

1031
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:07,990
totally terrible thing to do with the

1032
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,879
campaign emails because you're screwing

1033
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,529
our numbers because it's herd immunity I

1034
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,960
don't want them to think that they can't

1035
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,099
protect each other so it's more of a hey

1036
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,260
if you know it's a phishing campaign

1037
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,119
email and it's not actually malicious

1038
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,920
please let it go however if you think

1039
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:27,299
it's real phishing email please use her

1040
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,299
community yes sure

1041
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:40,730
right I'm not sure exactly what the ASP

1042
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:43,190
program is oh yes so it's anybody that

1043
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,109
has a contract with us that we

1044
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,180
communicate with on a business level so

1045
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,578
small business owners meaning like like

1046
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,770
business owners that have seen C E or

1047
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:54,470
CMS as a utility but also the people

1048
00:40:51,770 --> 00:41:04,549
that we program with for our internal

1049
00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:14,890
programs as well yep I'm gonna talk to

1050
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:14,890
them right

1051
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,720
yeah like 70% of our leadership is

1052
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,650
against punitive or against against

1053
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,939
punitive and offer the positive a bit

1054
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,160
there against the phishing program I

1055
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,410
have yet to receive feedback that we

1056
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,420
should shut down and that's because

1057
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,819
we've pushed so hard proving to them

1058
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:37,190
that this is an issue I mean this Easter

1059
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:38,630
team the blue team you know most of

1060
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,130
their job role or at least half of their

1061
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,289
job role is paying attention to phishing

1062
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,599
emails and if we can you know provide

1063
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:46,339
the funding for them to do that every

1064
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,930
single day then why not prevent you know

1065
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:50,630
or provide the funding for training

1066
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:52,069
people to help them with that so if

1067
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,140
they're if we're reporting the phishing

1068
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:56,089
emails and also reporting spam emails

1069
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,279
one thing less they'll have to do is go

1070
00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:00,259
dig to the spam emails if they learn so

1071
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:02,089
you know it's it's going to cutback in

1072
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,789
the funding of or not cut back on the

1073
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:06,529
funding but cut back on the expense of

1074
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:08,059
being having to do Incident Response so

1075
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:10,039
less images you have two or less

1076
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:12,079
machines you have to reimage you know

1077
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:13,460
less chance of having a breach so my

1078
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,549
recommendation to you is to go to him

1079
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,549
and you know show him that 94% of cyber

1080
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:21,230
tech start with a phishing email but

1081
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:28,670
millions of dollars could be saved by

1082
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:30,470
not having that breach right you should

1083
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,940
send them to me I don't get shut down

1084
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:36,348
very quickly or if I do I don't stop

1085
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:39,319
being a being empowered to have a voice

1086
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:41,290
that my job has really made me like a

1087
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:45,330
bulldozer when it comes to fishing

1088
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,330
other questions yep

1089
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,130
it's generalized so there's placeholders

1090
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:57,040
as we call them where they can give or

1091
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,810
they give or get information from us we

1092
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,509
have the we have had the request

1093
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,500
actually more times than not for

1094
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,870
organizations to have their personal

1095
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,640
click great information in there so if

1096
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,930
they don't feel comfortable presenting

1097
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,670
the meeting the box information

1098
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,200
themselves they have the right to ask us

1099
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,540
to come and present it for them with

1100
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,100
more detail so the advocates receive the

1101
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,500
organizational information so they have

1102
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,990
the click rates monthly some of them

1103
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,400
it's all in Excel CSV files so some of

1104
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,770
them don't have the knowledge in Excel

1105
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,440
to do data analytics on that and we're

1106
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,490
happy to provide that form upon request

1107
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,470
and in the event that they need

1108
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,359
something presented so if they want more

1109
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,620
detail they're welcome to ask us and

1110
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,180
we've communicated that with the

1111
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,470
advocates but the meeting in the box is

1112
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,259
generalized towards everybody in the

1113
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:40,770
company so anybody could use it does

1114
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,770
that answer your question

1115
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:51,019
right

1116
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:02,710
we haven't thus far besides the topics

1117
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,240
of the emails being sent as campaign

1118
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,300
emails to further test to see if we're

1119
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,060
vulnerable to that however we last month

1120
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,050
our data analytics responded to us that

1121
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,270
we have a problem in certain

1122
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,850
organizations so we want to target those

1123
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,350
organizations specifically and I did we

1124
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,089
don't have a plan laid out yet but we do

1125
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,560
have actions to take to speak with

1126
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,210
people without with it within that

1127
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,070
organization to see why they could be

1128
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,660
clicking or if maybe if they're not

1129
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,460
trickling down the importance from the

1130
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,589
leadership of the importance of phishing

1131
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,880
right so if if you will see these

1132
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,380
phishing emails every month and you hear

1133
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,390
nothing else about it from your advocate

1134
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,500
or from your leadership that it's

1135
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:37,000
important to not click on them and

1136
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,890
important to learn more about phishing

1137
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,600
then that could cause some of this to be

1138
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,270
happening so we're gonna do more

1139
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,910
analytics as which started last month

1140
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,170
and the organization that we're having

1141
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,970
problems with with the high click rate

1142
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,280
but also having high headcount so we're

1143
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,930
gonna we are going to modify some of our

1144
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,750
trainings to target them we have it

1145
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,750
that's thus far yes

1146
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,460
mm-hm

1147
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:39,210
right so you're asking how we cut back

1148
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:44,129
on that we can't as a natural part and a

1149
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:45,240
an accepted risk so when we learned that

1150
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,589
this was happening we actually learned

1151
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,759
because somebody forwarded the email and

1152
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:49,770
said don't click on this because it's a

1153
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,770
phishing email and then somebody clicked

1154
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:55,980
on it through the forwarded email so I

1155
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,839
was like yeah funny not funny right so

1156
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,270
when it was court luckily it was a

1157
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,190
campaign email that it happened but the

1158
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,930
campaign URLs that are sent monthly are

1159
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,609
unique to that user and they change for

1160
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:09,270
every user as its sent and that's part

1161
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:10,529
of the tools expectations with us so

1162
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,240
when they clicked on it the other person

1163
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,770
got reported as as clicking on the link

1164
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,629
and then they're like I didn't click and

1165
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:20,009
they were like yeah but our sim told us

1166
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:22,099
that you forwarded it so cutting back on

1167
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:24,480
the phishing emails being forwarded

1168
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,460
we've requested if they're going to do

1169
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,890
it because you know a lot of people are

1170
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,410
the can't stop won't stop mindset if

1171
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:34,558
they're going to do it screenshot it and

1172
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:35,970
and forward it that way I hate telling

1173
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,619
them no because if it's a real phishing

1174
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,419
email and telling them not you're not

1175
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,250
even just screenshot it you know they

1176
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,349
could save somebody but not forwarding

1177
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,210
absolutely is like 14 is a big no-no so

1178
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:46,760
we do keep track in the sim but we don't

1179
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:49,650
have a metric reporting on our

1180
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,510
diminishing returns of having people

1181
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,220
forward so whether or not we're losing

1182
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,079
clicks which I mean losing clicks is

1183
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,118
something we'd rather have than having

1184
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,619
too many but we're doing we don't have

1185
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,329
any metrics on whether or not we're

1186
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:03,319
losing clicks or losing reporters based

1187
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:03,319
on community

1188
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,740
right we we do track the peaks of when

1189
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,479
it hits when it hits the high point of

1190
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:20,000
clicks but we don't track how that

1191
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:23,000
relates to herd immunity other questions

1192
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
yes

1193
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,079
right

1194
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:43,660
so we do keep communications with other

1195
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:46,000
companies in the industry when they see

1196
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,680
something it's and it's been more recent

1197
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,570
than in the past but when they see

1198
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,940
something that they find is suspicious

1199
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,110
or could be like a huge risk we

1200
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,460
communicate with them regarding that and

1201
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,430
then if we see something we communicate

1202
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,720
to them right now the reason we found

1203
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:01,029
the Google Docs email is because we

1204
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,709
received it and that's how we knew like

1205
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,300
this could be an issue and then it was

1206
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,150
also like all over the news two days

1207
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,490
later so the communications we have are

1208
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,740
with other people in industry are for

1209
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,450
like the basis of keeping each other

1210
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,709
safe because you know it's a competitive

1211
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,879
market but it's not competitive on who's

1212
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,500
gonna be ahead like I don't want you

1213
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,300
spending four hundred and twenty million

1214
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,590
dollars on a breach and you know and

1215
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,730
then potentially happening to me I want

1216
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,110
to know how you were breached so that I

1217
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,060
can prevent it from happening to me

1218
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,430
so those communications are in point to

1219
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,990
keep track of the current phishing

1220
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,359
emails that are out there and then we

1221
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,859
also keep track on our C cert team has

1222
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,530
like multiple screens and they're

1223
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,270
running through like different websites

1224
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,310
that that report out phishing attacks

1225
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,170
that are happening some of them are

1226
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,340
Twitter Twitter blogs that are going out

1227
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,900
reporting phishing emails that are

1228
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,420
happening so we try to keep in the

1229
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,950
social network as much as we can to keep

1230
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,110
track of what's happening in the cyber

1231
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,700
world with phishing but we also do

1232
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,830
communicate with our partners in

1233
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,259
industry and partners and non partners

1234
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,730
in the industry does that help answer

1235
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,890
your question okay cool

1236
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:03,640
any other questions comments concerns

1237
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:11,500
snide remarks I'll take all of it Ben

1238
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:13,150
you have a snide remark I know it we

1239
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,570
sold it as a safety issue and a budget

1240
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:18,310
issue so when you think about like

1241
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,160
Lansing Board of Water and light its

1242
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,200
kind of well no not in 2016 one IT

1243
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,810
analyst clicked on a phishing email and

1244
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,100
they were shut down for two weeks people

1245
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,380
couldn't pay their bills which is an

1246
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,790
expense problem as it is and then also

1247
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,320
that it costs them two and a half

1248
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,350
million dollars total in insurance

1249
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,760
claims the reporting issue and then

1250
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,020
getting the ransomware off their

1251
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,820
computers so they had to pay the key

1252
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,290
which was only like to get the key was

1253
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,230
like twenty five thousand dollars but it

1254
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,820
costs him two and a half million so we

1255
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,410
had to sell sell them on that point of

1256
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,090
all these companies that had these

1257
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,920
breaches including like Target which was

1258
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,059
the HVAC vendor right that cost him four

1259
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,699
hundred twenty million

1260
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:56,139
so you know we we sold it as a budgeting

1261
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:58,089
issue but we also sold it as a safety

1262
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:59,499
issue because if a whole bunch of people

1263
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:01,419
are clicking on phishing emails and

1264
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:03,249
handing out their credentials how do we

1265
00:50:01,419 --> 00:50:04,839
keep up with if we're not seeing any

1266
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:06,578
action for six months which sometimes

1267
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:08,380
happens how do we keep up with how many

1268
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:10,029
credentials we have that are leaked so

1269
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,519
we could have credentials out there and

1270
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:13,779
you know six months down the road after

1271
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:15,459
the credentials were handed out have a

1272
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:17,380
breach and not realizing that it

1273
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:18,609
happened six months ago so it's a safety

1274
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,109
issue on that part but it's a huge

1275
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:23,288
budget issue especially being a

1276
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:25,269
regulated utility you know our every

1277
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:27,069
dime that we spend we have to like

1278
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:28,479
justify it so if we're spending two and

1279
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:31,209
a half to four hundred and twenty

1280
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,499
million dollars on security breaches and

1281
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:33,879
something that could be prevented or we

1282
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:35,738
could have trained on like that's

1283
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,119
something we really need to focus on so

1284
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:41,699
that's we sold it as a budget issue but

1285
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:43,749
also as a safety issue other questions

1286
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:45,189
cool well I'll be around for the rest of

1287
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,078
the day I do plan on staying for closing

1288
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:49,419
remarks you can also reach out to me on

1289
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,799
Twitter at 6-foot 64 I'm open to

1290
00:50:49,419 --> 00:50:52,388
questions concerns and I'll still take

1291
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:53,470
those snide remarks so thank you guys

1292
00:50:52,389 --> 00:51:00,720
for listening to me today

1293
00:50:53,470 --> 00:51:00,720
[Applause]
