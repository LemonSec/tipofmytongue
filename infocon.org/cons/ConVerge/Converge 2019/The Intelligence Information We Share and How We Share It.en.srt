1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,879
my last name I'm only known as Jimmy if

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,100
you call into the office and ask for

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,360
anybody my last name they will not know

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,700
you're talking about if you say Jimmy

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,740
they will know that I am in the double

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,369
locked door security room that I'm not

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:24,369
sure yet is for my protection or gen-pop

8
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,689
so and since this is the community I

9
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,980
used to work with Keith and he'll tell

10
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:30,579
you it's probably for their protection

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:34,540
so what I was asked to talk about today

12
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:37,899
so what do i do at Blue Cross well they

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,900
call it cyber threat intelligence I like

14
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,640
to consider it as a cyber intelligence

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,800
we look at a lot of different

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,910
information so they asked me to come out

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,069
here to talk about the intelligence

18
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,550
information what we share and how we

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,380
share it and then at first I thought our

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,110
I think they're trying to set me up to

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,630
get fired again because like the first

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,420
rule of Fight Club is especially for the

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,909
Intel people you don't you just don't

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,060
talk about those things so I went to my

25
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,679
team lead nice to dude what what am I

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,920
supposed to talk about cuz I can't talk

27
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:18,630
TTP and he's like we'll just keep it at

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,679
a high level so I'm gonna speak to about

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,060
intelligence from a very high level I'm

30
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,340
not gonna get down into the weeds how I

31
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,649
actually do it what I do with it and how

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,569
I create my products right or my

33
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:30,100
collection process where I get my

34
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:31,960
collections from and all of that other

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,419
stuff but I will give you an idea of the

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,979
things that I look for on a regular

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:42,009
basis how many people in this room are

38
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,789
there companies Intel person because I

39
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:48,069
know a lot of times you get

40
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:50,679
double-stacked just one too so so most

41
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:52,389
mostly no okay and and the reason why I

42
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,179
asked that is because intelligence is

43
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:56,829
definitely its own language okay even

44
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,509
within the intelligence community you

45
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,029
can start talking about certain things

46
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:06,579
and there is keywords and vernacular

47
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:08,348
that are used and if I say something and

48
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,758
I'm not explaining myself correctly I

49
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:11,829
know I only have 50 minutes to get

50
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,630
through this please don't be afraid and

51
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,790
raise your hand and ask me what I'm

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,380
talking about because my wife explains

53
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,940
to me that nine times out of ten I sound

54
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,109
like Sheldon and

55
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,540
he knows what the hell I'm talking about

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:29,470
so okay I'll take her word for it she is

57
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,060
the boss so when they put me back in the

58
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,490
seat of cyber intelligence when we had a

59
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,560
woman our new seaso came in they said

60
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,420
okay Jimmy what are you gonna do with

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,270
intelligence tonight I kind of scratched

62
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,369
my head and I was like well it's kind of

63
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,470
been a train wreck for three years you

64
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,330
know we've had some wins and losses I

65
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,220
said but really a lot of things that

66
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,350
intelligence has been asked to do is not

67
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,000
really an intelligence function and they

68
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,609
said well what is intelligence function

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,920
I said intelligence is about education

70
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,570
and weariness and enrichment okay I am

71
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,089
NOT here to manage your feeds

72
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,700
do not ever ask me to manage your feeds

73
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,260
I can tell you about feeds and I can

74
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,299
rate the quality of feeds but that is

75
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,359
not my sole purpose my purpose is to

76
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,920
educate whoever the audience is which is

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,660
typically they in the intelligence

78
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,850
community they'll call it the customer

79
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,740
right to educate the customer to make

80
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,660
the customer aware of things and to

81
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,790
enrich their operation or process

82
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,109
procedure whatever whatever that request

83
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,179
is right they'll talk about a thing

84
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,190
called a PIR primary intelligence

85
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,180
requirement that will determine what

86
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,070
you're going to collect how you're going

87
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,500
to make your product who the audience is

88
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:43,049
and so on and so forth right so it's not

89
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:45,550
to manage feeds another thing to so I do

90
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,320
private research right I'm always

91
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,480
academically doing something on my free

92
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,269
time it's people do gaming or

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,070
snowboarding like my son does and I'm a

94
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:57,220
lot like egon from ghostbusters I

95
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:01,180
collect spores molds and fungus that was

96
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,000
a two fell flat it's a tough crowd tough

97
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,550
crowd okay um so in my free time I

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,200
collect open source information and then

99
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,940
I store it and correlate it and try to

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,899
find relationships or unique things

101
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,529
about things that are being reported by

102
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,790
people like unit 42 or Cisco Talos or

103
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:26,109
independent researchers or

104
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:30,220
or Twitter post or whatever might be one

105
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,950
of the things years ago in healthcare

106
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,590
because I'm speaking I guess you could

107
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,479
say on behalf of my employer we would

108
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:41,320
always look at intelligence from the

109
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,870
perspective of well it hit financial it

110
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,930
it doesn't it doesn't apply to me and

111
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,420
over the years my own personal research

112
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:54,430
has led me to a different conclusion I

113
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:58,590
can support that so years ago if you can

114
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,590
believe this I was 30 40 pounds lighter

115
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,229
I may or may not have abuse or abuse

116
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,060
certain substances I was in the music

117
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,860
business I had hair down to the middle

118
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,750
of my back and the only thing I ever

119
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,320
wanted to do was go on tour with Iron

120
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,360
Maiden

121
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,500
right so I yeah there's a man right

122
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,500
there he knows what I'm talking about

123
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,720
so in my research I'm gonna throw some

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,000
names at Jimi Hendrix Led Zeppelin Ozzy

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,170
Osbourne Iron Maiden Mozart BB King Run

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,750
DMC right all artists all very

127
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,540
influential artists too by the way so if

128
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,220
you study music for any sort of period

129
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,710
of time you're going to find someone

130
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,860
that you want to emulate you are

131
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,539
attracted to their creative solar spark

132
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,530
or the way that they might manage their

133
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:50,590
modes or use a pentatonic scale or the

134
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,710
fact that they write more symphonic

135
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:57,310
ballads versus you know blues were if

136
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,370
using the 1 4 or 5 right I did that and

137
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,440
then at some point I went well I really

138
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,330
like the way BB King does this I want to

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,610
do it a different way and I want to

140
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,229
apply my own methodologies to his

141
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,120
current what you would consider to be

142
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,920
musical achievements or musical research

143
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,900
and that's what's actually happening out

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,700
there in the wild these days right you

145
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,710
have things that are considered key

146
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,740
indicators of maybe a certain actor

147
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,270
group but there's in it's been going on

148
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,520
now for so long that there's

149
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,680
up-and-comers and then there's the

150
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,000
pre-established right so you have your

151
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,220
old and your new and the new always

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,270
looks to the old to say well what have

153
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,760
you done what have you been successful

154
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,529
with right so Lazarus group we all know

155
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,839
it's a you know North Korea

156
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,808
is that another thing whatever there's a

157
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,539
dearth of research on Lazarus group that

158
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:46,329
if I wanted to partner with certain

159
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,068
coders or malware malware writers or

160
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:51,669
whoever on the underground I could

161
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:53,889
literally take Lazarus architecture

162
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,709
attack architecture that's been posted

163
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,539
by companies like fire I and literally

164
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,999
begin my own campaign and target

165
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,248
healthcare with that same methodology so

166
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:07,059
where's the silos that's not education

167
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:09,129
awareness and enrichment right so I won

168
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,079
I had to get that out I've been on my

169
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:14,799
soapbox in a while but I just got I just

170
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:18,189
got done at a conference not too long

171
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:19,779
ago and it was a good say an internal

172
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:23,189
company conference and I overheard

173
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:30,519
somebody say well it's not in our silo

174
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:32,079
okay so today in order intelligence

175
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,589
happens all at once

176
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,329
and typically it's going to involve the

177
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:40,719
five W's I was only asked to talk about

178
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:43,539
two of those which is the who and/or the

179
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:46,299
what and the how or the who what where

180
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:49,089
when why anyways so we're gonna go

181
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:51,248
actually go across all of those those

182
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:54,489
five areas but first we're gonna start

183
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:56,679
with how it gets shared because because

184
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,539
it happens all at once there's a lot of

185
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:01,328
things that get attached to pieces of

186
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:03,818
information that an intelligence analyst

187
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:07,599
will look at when they're appraising an

188
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:10,359
artifact to understand how the artifact

189
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,149
should be handled right the how so the

190
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:17,649
first thing has anybody ever heard of

191
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:20,019
the traffic-light protocol okay so at

192
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,939
almost half of you so the traffic light

193
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,649
protocol then we're gonna talk about how

194
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,869
things might get shared on it from

195
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:32,198
technical systems taxonomy taxonomy

196
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:34,269
anyone use tax on amis okay so taxonomy

197
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:35,708
x' and then i know there's there's a

198
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:42,698
couple different analytical types that

199
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:45,219
we do almost reflexively brian is my

200
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:47,769
counterpart at work and reflexively we

201
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,160
think in certain and analytical terms

202
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,800
which would you not

203
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,149
like we definitely so one of the things

204
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,679
that Brian and I have been working on is

205
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,300
determining where is the line of

206
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,949
delineation between these analytical

207
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,899
types right system one versus system two

208
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:04,309
so what is traffic like protocol or TLP

209
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,720
it's a set of rules for sharing

210
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:08,110
information so it's a classification

211
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,540
level right and who gets to see the data

212
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:14,209
it determines the scope of the share and

213
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:20,779
the framework is freely available on

214
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:22,368
us-cert noon yawning please and this is

215
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,119
just an example I don't know how this

216
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:28,489
came out but this gives you an idea of

217
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:29,749
if it's read/write you don't share it

218
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,759
with anybody outside of the room

219
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,809
typically if it's Amber you can

220
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,209
typically share it within your

221
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,860
organization if it's green you can share

222
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,589
it across affiliates and if it's white

223
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,860
it's fair game a lot of times you will

224
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,720
get an email and it will say TLP amber

225
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,910
right the intelligence analysts at that

226
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,029
point is now responsible for how that

227
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,439
data moves across the wire and and when

228
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,889
I mean across the wire that can also

229
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:56,269
mean from a human or humming however you

230
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,740
want to pronounce that perspective and

231
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,220
we'll talk about that to you because in

232
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,860
cyber intelligence there's a couple of

233
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:07,339
key intelligence domains right you have

234
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,549
mass and and say games and geo and

235
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:13,209
there's Osen there's humming and those

236
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:18,019
oh those are specific domains of

237
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:22,128
intelligence work right the technical

238
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:23,809
systems so one of the things that people

239
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,470
don't really I think they kind of take

240
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:29,389
it for granted is your firewalls

241
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,199
antivirus IDs if it's plugged into a

242
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,540
feed those are all actually sharing

243
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:39,439
intelligence information right so you

244
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,879
can get some and televisions information

245
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,669
without having to make intelligence

246
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,910
investments like in you know

247
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:49,040
intelligence platforms simply on your

248
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,829
traditional security products every time

249
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,299
your antivirus updates you're actually

250
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:54,469
getting shared intelligence we just

251
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:57,740
don't really consider it that way

252
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,929
because culturally for the last 10 or 15

253
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,880
years we've looked at intelligence in

254
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,400
its own silo but in

255
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,380
it started probably a little little more

256
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,449
than half a decade ago where the

257
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,340
antivirus company started selling the

258
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,980
concept of sharing their data with their

259
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:16,730
customers when new information is found

260
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,740
so what is that sharing it's probably

261
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,100
considered a mixture a hybrid mixture of

262
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,830
like TLP red and TLP amber it's that

263
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,150
it's not going to be green and it's

264
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,950
definitely not going to be white because

265
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,449
it's proprietary information to them or

266
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,750
they're gonna say they have copyright on

267
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:36,170
that discovery right we share

268
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:41,260
intelligence through emails those emails

269
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:46,130
can contain a wide range of things from

270
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:50,150
qualitative reports to like just an

271
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:55,580
advisory to actual key indicators those

272
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:57,740
emails might get stamped with TLP text

273
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,850
and voice you're like what do you mean

274
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,250
text and boy yeah

275
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,160
so you ever been to slack I'm pretty

276
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,410
sure anybody in my sac is on slack that

277
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,870
is a way that is a technical system for

278
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,600
sharing intelligence right same with

279
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,340
VoIP you get on a call conferences

280
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,140
obviously I'm sharing intelligence well

281
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,230
at all of you my education and

282
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,150
experience publications documents and

283
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,860
then you have your dedicated what you

284
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,689
would call intelligence based systems

285
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,300
that an intelligence analyst might use

286
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,820
in the field which would be like your

287
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,140
your Foss your free open source software

288
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,160
and then your Koch or

289
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,600
commercial-off-the-shelf

290
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,459
so anomaly and Truestar would be

291
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,340
examples of what a company could

292
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,730
purchase to ingest intelligence or share

293
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,160
intelligence from a cots perspective

294
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,040
misspend crits would be examples of and

295
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,319
I have references to these things at the

296
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,579
end of the slide deck I don't know if

297
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,710
these slides are gonna get shared out

298
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,850
but if you need the references they're

299
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:00,890
there those would be considered free

300
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,360
open source right so those are some of

301
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:07,990
the technical ways that we would

302
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,990
actually share intelligence taxonomy

303
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:17,920
I didn't know it but years ago I was

304
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,630
struggling to explain to someone that

305
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,939
the indicators of compromise that

306
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,730
they're giving me did not have enough

307
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,190
context what I was really telling them

308
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:32,140
was I needed you to put something in a

309
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:34,000
taxonomy so a taxonomy right but who

310
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,540
uses taxonomy sorry I got these new

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,330
bifocals I'm that age now individuals or

312
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,540
groups looking to classify informational

313
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,340
artifacts what our taxonomy is agnostic

314
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,969
Li taxonomy Zoar systems of data

315
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,310
classification where they use scientific

316
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,020
data biological and any other form of

317
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,609
practice that requires information to be

318
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,630
classified within the confines of a

319
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,030
hierarchical system when are they used

320
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,689
wherever data artifacts record

321
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,930
classification and how are they used

322
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,630
from the viewpoint of intelligence work

323
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,870
we will classify events within a certain

324
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,220
level of taxonomy or we will classify

325
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,580
data with a certain level of taxonomy

326
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,290
what I mean by that is I have an

327
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,640
artifact okay so what's the artifact the

328
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,370
artifact is a piece of malware okay

329
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,530
great so that type of malware what is it

330
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,690
a Trojan is that a download or is it a

331
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,490
whatever I need I need that

332
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:30,400
classification I need you to apply that

333
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,720
taxonomy to tell me what kind of malware

334
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,959
because if I've never seen this malware

335
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,460
before I need to know where to start and

336
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,380
sometimes that could be nomenclature

337
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,630
used by NF virus offenders Paulo D

338
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,280
motets can crab yadda-yadda-yadda

339
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,150
that's everyn regular I was talking

340
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,040
about and then these taxonomy also help

341
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,020
from a research perspective because if

342
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,329
you wanted to you could then start to

343
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,160
data mine on the taxonomy z-- themselves

344
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,740
right and you can start to try to find

345
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,900
correlations between certain malware

346
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:04,960
families you can start to look for

347
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:08,260
metrics from a perspective of well fire

348
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:11,410
I said ransomware is big in in in

349
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:15,210
healthcare ok great well I've classified

350
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:17,350
35 events and out of those 35 events

351
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,910
majority of them weren't ransomware they

352
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,120
were actually some sort of a downloader

353
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,550
right whether it was power load emote ad

354
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,670
I think s load is another download or so

355
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:31,240
on and so forth right so that's what I

356
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:35,140
mean by taxonomy so it's in in in in in

357
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:39,370
layman's terms tags what's what's it

358
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:43,540
tagged with okay and then there's two

359
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,580
two types of analytics when I when I

360
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,029
went back and when I when I said I am

361
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:53,680
NOT your feed manager I am NOT a manager

362
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:55,990
of feeds when someone like myself or

363
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,810
someone like Brian goes and looks at

364
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,990
data the first thing we we we want to do

365
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:05,709
is stop and think about the data right

366
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,630
and I'll get to some of that in a later

367
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,950
on as we get down into some of the

368
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,250
further things that kill chain diamond

369
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:14,620
model and so on and so forth so Brian

370
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:19,089
and I will look at things I hate to keep

371
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,310
bringing you up dude but I love like we

372
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,560
acquired Brian like six months ago and I

373
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,390
cannot tell you how ridiculously happy

374
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,609
because I have somebody now that kind of

375
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,470
knows what I'm talking about you know

376
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,060
and I don't get the glazed eye he's like

377
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,800
yeah so you're really just talking about

378
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,599
what was it the other days like how is

379
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,400
that any different than networker now a

380
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,390
network link now so I'm like it's not he

381
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,920
goes okay

382
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,180
and so he you know the light bulb went

383
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,110
on a he knows what I'm talking about

384
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:47,529
thank God so system to it's very slow

385
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,270
it's very methodical it it will look at

386
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:52,330
data from several points of view you'll

387
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,699
do analysis of competing hypotheses

388
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,560
you'll do what if scenarios you'll try

389
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,490
to do some of the other complex

390
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,229
algorithms like what is a Bayesian right

391
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,059
to see if there's a pattern in some of

392
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,339
those things and that that all of that

393
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,559
stuff takes time to a degree even if you

394
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,119
have a system of scripts or applications

395
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,439
or whatnot they're still gonna have to

396
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,159
if some of you you Splunk or elk or what

397
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,040
does it

398
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,870
Splunk elk anything of this i was just

399
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,540
talking to key q radar you know

400
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:28,419
sometimes your search can take a while

401
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,970
to get a return so data analytics or

402
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,410
system to thinking depending on your

403
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,360
your amount of data or what you're

404
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,190
asking to see from the data can

405
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,990
can take some time so just the whole

406
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,399
process can be very slow in fact the

407
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,860
research that I've conducted over the

408
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:44,750
last year and a half using Osen I'm just

409
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,658
now in a year and a half I have enough

410
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,309
data to show key indicators between

411
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,960
certain types of malware and then shared

412
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,519
indicators between certain psych types

413
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,200
of malware with a certain level of

414
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,539
certainty right so there needs to be a

415
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,210
temporal aspect and in system two you

416
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,950
say well well how long should I actually

417
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,000
conduct this study and and that's

418
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,460
something from a research perspective

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,799
and then there's system one I got an

420
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,960
indicator knee-jerk reactions gotta go

421
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,720
out to community type of email taggle

422
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,880
the TLP send it's gone I'm not thinking

423
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,380
about it right so there's there's a

424
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,450
couple of ways in which we actually

425
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,830
operate and and oh geez I don't know if

426
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,529
I have this reference but this was

427
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,260
actually developed by some of the folks

428
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:29,230
at the CIA way back during World War two

429
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,309
they came in and said wow you really

430
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,470
kind of screwed this whole program up

431
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,080
and they they came up with a system

432
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,210
warning system to thinking so how we

433
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,519
share also means how we're thinking

434
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,840
about the data that we're actually going

435
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,279
to share and what we're going to do with

436
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,439
it before we actually share out the

437
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:50,090
product okay so what intelligence

438
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,799
information so we talked a little bit

439
00:18:50,090 --> 00:19:00,158
about the how and now we're going to

440
00:18:51,799 --> 00:19:02,870
talk a little bit about the what so

441
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,990
because most people are familiar with

442
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:10,939
threat intelligence I decided to kind of

443
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:13,760
keep it in that vein but that in my

444
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:19,429
opinion cyber intelligence it can also

445
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,200
be about political pieces what's going

446
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,179
on in a certain country is that does

447
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,470
that ramp up the prospects of more

448
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,840
malware coming out of that country

449
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,649
because it's a whatever it's in whatever

450
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,209
state I figured you know what I have no

451
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,529
idea what whoo you know what the skill

452
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,720
level is of the audience I'm just gonna

453
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,840
keep it in the threat space so from the

454
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,120
threat space we have what we would share

455
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,730
we you can put that into a couple of

456
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,178
different buckets these are not all the

457
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,190
buckets like internal proprietary stuff

458
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:52,210
is not there like so if I

459
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,680
verse engineers something at work and

460
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,510
then I get all of these artifacts out of

461
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,400
it whether it's through a sandbox or

462
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,760
something like Ida or what have you

463
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,250
that's no longer OSINT

464
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,560
based material right so with the kill

465
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,850
chain let's talk about that box so

466
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,129
there's there's the kill chain and

467
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,040
diamond model they're taxonomy Zoar or

468
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,830
systems to group information together

469
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,480
and and collect certain things right it

470
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,010
gives you your P IRS you know what

471
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,480
you're gonna be collecting and then

472
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,460
there's there's there's different types

473
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,140
of collection or different types of

474
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,780
intelligence Oh sent home it will go

475
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:31,250
back to that because I know I mentioned

476
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,840
that previously um so the kill chain the

477
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,820
kill chain I'm sure you guys have all

478
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,840
heard of the kill chain right has

479
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,200
anybody not heard of the kill chain okay

480
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,399
good

481
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,880
I can almost probably skip this slide

482
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,980
but we won't so basically the kill chain

483
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,470
is a taxonomy system created by Lockheed

484
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,910
Martin it's used to track atomic

485
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,380
indicators for identification of

486
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,380
possible threat actors and campaigns

487
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,939
example items that are tracked IP

488
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,750
addresses hash values domains file names

489
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,500
registry keys so on and so forth and

490
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,300
then the outputs from that collection

491
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,590
going to the kill chain course of action

492
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:15,440
kill chain course of action matrix has

493
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,480
anybody heard of that okay so that's new

494
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,130
alright that's great okay we're in

495
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,660
Jimi's world right now I'm sorry I don't

496
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:29,740
talk this much and usually if I do I'm

497
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:32,030
at a bar and I'm probably drinking so

498
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,490
the kill chain it's the what we share

499
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,720
right we and it might be shared in or

500
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,240
might be shared out but those are gonna

501
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,830
be the types of types of data that gets

502
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,150
shared in and out right atomic

503
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,050
indicators from a kill chain perspective

504
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:48,020
there's a couple things you can do with

505
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,940
that data you can take that data and you

506
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,590
can keep that data and you can blend it

507
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,300
with let's say it's it's information

508
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,639
from an external entity and they're

509
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,800
sending it to me and then I've I've got

510
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,540
my own kill chain bucket of data we can

511
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,159
then start to blend that together to

512
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,090
find what's called key indicators of

513
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,920
compromised

514
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,480
so just to say that you have an

515
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,770
indicator of compromise does not mean

516
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,050
that you necessarily have an

517
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,510
identifiable enough identifiable

518
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,399
information to start to say there's a

519
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,890
campaign happening against our company

520
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,390
just because you got spam scanned does

521
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,580
not mean there's a campaign going on

522
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,530
right just because you got a thousand

523
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,879
friggin phishing emails does not mean

524
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,820
that you actually had a campaign going

525
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,340
on the key indicator is an indicator

526
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,260
that's been seen more than once over a

527
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,550
period of time now you set that period

528
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,220
of time do you want to say it's six

529
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,129
weeks six days six minutes I don't know

530
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,750
that's entirely up you right but you

531
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:41,210
take those key indicators and then and

532
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,590
then you say now this this is this is

533
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,720
where the actor is all of this other

534
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,340
stuff is kind of like I don't want to

535
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,470
say noise could be diversionary like

536
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,330
they'll spam you and say oh yeah go to

537
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,720
Google Google com well I don't want

538
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,340
Google com I want something whatever

539
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,740
mail.ru that's my key indicator that

540
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,139
keeps coming in right and so then you

541
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,630
start to reverse-engineer all of that

542
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,670
infrastructure using things that you

543
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,650
know I don't know you'd research the IP

544
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:11,000
address do the who as I'm not gonna get

545
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:15,350
into that uh and then you can identify

546
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,210
the actor in campaign additionally the

547
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,570
kill chain course of action matrix says

548
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,970
okay you got a lot of stuff it's all in

549
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:26,530
these little taxonomy buckets retime

550
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,990
weaponization exploitation and whatever

551
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,649
what are you gonna do about it what do

552
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,480
you do about it

553
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,880
and that's an individual choice for

554
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,380
every organization to make I one of the

555
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,800
one of the one of the one of the key

556
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:42,740
things that I constantly push back on at

557
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,290
my organization or anywhere do not ask

558
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,990
me to tell you how to remediate this

559
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,879
threat I have no idea I have no idea

560
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,920
that's not that's not what I'm here for

561
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,600
that's for either Incident Response or

562
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,520
security operations or policy

563
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,679
development or whatever I'm giving you

564
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,110
the information education awareness and

565
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,060
enrichment I can't stress that enough

566
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,100
because as soon as you take me out of

567
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,690
that role I now become the incident

568
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,649
responder I now become the policy

569
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,850
developer I become the security engineer

570
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,260
what am I gonna have time to go back and

571
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,689
do all this other stuff because there's

572
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:18,169
a lot of work to be done in intelligence

573
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,669
and then now I'm on the hook for several

574
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,049
different items in the chain what do we

575
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:22,029
need all of these other teams for line

576
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,039
at that point

577
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,059
so that's the kill chain you can go and

578
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,590
get it

579
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,200
Lockheed Martin's got tons of

580
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:33,619
documentation lots of people we do use

581
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,769
it I use it in my own research to kind

582
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:38,899
of get an idea of how a threat actor is

583
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:42,289
working which then leads me to this next

584
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:44,059
piece which is the diamond model I do

585
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:46,249
apologize I've been looking for the last

586
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,649
couple of weeks on where that came from

587
00:24:46,249 --> 00:25:00,129
the diamond model and I still can't find

588
00:24:48,649 --> 00:25:02,418
it but yeah that's that Sergio guy sweet

589
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:05,359
okay okay great

590
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:06,710
I'll I'll do Sergio kind of diamond

591
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,809
model and searching because I would

592
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,869
really love to see the the fundamental

593
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:15,229
foundational work I I love history

594
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:18,408
I don't really track intelligence and we

595
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:19,729
have people at work that track the the

596
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,159
the things that are happening right now

597
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:23,690
I love history because I want to I want

598
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,629
it there there's a story that's being

599
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,830
told there right just seeing it I read a

600
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:30,799
great book when I was going through my

601
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,168
graduate program that said this the the

602
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,668
all of our acronym agencies are so

603
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:37,789
focused on the tactical that we have

604
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:39,889
nobody anymore that writes about what it

605
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:41,330
all means right so I love put together

606
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:42,289
those things so I like I love to

607
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,149
understand the history of where

608
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,559
something came from so that I can get an

609
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:47,658
idea of what that person was thinking so

610
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,749
anyways the diamond model the difference

611
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:53,059
between the diamond model and the kill

612
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:55,639
chain from from a sharing perspective is

613
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:59,029
that although the diamond model will

614
00:25:55,639 --> 00:26:01,369
have your indicators of compromise right

615
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:03,830
from your kill chains the diamond model

616
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:07,820
also looks to do adversarial assessments

617
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:09,470
and it also looks to focus on the victim

618
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,689
type right the kill chain doesn't really

619
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,220
when you get into sharing kill chain

620
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,509
stuff it's I'm and I'm sure you guys

621
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,080
have gotten these things through either

622
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:20,509
your slack channels or whatever might be

623
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,059
bad IP phishing one iron - did it did it

624
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:27,810
that I did it - that okay great Wow that

625
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:29,250
buddy so you have that right but

626
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,470
the same time you're not taking that

627
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,240
information and going okay well how do i

628
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,390
how do i apply this to the adversary

629
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,240
what are they behind in engine X proxy

630
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,310
or what services are they using if it's

631
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,980
targeting you what are what are you as

632
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:46,379
the victim are you a window shop are you

633
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,940
a Linux shop are you a add provider or

634
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,950
healthcare or whatever so the diamond

635
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,990
model looks to expand on your on your on

636
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,230
your on your on your kill chain items

637
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:58,380
right and and it asks you to make

638
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:05,700
assessment so from from what I would

639
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:08,700
share perspective is an RFI it's a great

640
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,970
example page it asked me for an RFI one

641
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,920
time on a certain set of indicators so

642
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,200
basically what she was asking me for was

643
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,640
an assessment right and so that's

644
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,160
basically the difference between the

645
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,920
diamond model and the kill chain and I

646
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,530
created my product my intelligence

647
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,470
product based off of things from the

648
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:31,020
kill chain that was ingested was an

649
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:34,020
input from another team member to an

650
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,060
output of a diamond model right so when

651
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,379
you talk about what we share there's a

652
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,960
couple of different things there's your

653
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,400
your your little key indicators right

654
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,910
that you you load up in your sim or

655
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,690
whatever to assessments to report to

656
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,240
whatever okay

657
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:55,350
open source intelligence so I'm bringing

658
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:59,640
this up as a share because it does get

659
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:06,300
shared around a lot I will be at at day

660
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:08,040
job and I'll get a link that says check

661
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:13,620
this out something new was reported by

662
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:17,070
whatever news company we actually for as

663
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:20,120
much as we say we need intelligence and

664
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:25,409
there are companies that will tell you

665
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:29,280
that they will provide that to you and

666
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:31,140
it's it's value-added most of your RSS

667
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,840
feeds are where they get you their data

668
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,040
from to begin with it's all sent it's

669
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,929
all out there it's just a matter of

670
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,010
taking the time and this goes back to

671
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,710
that vernacular and

672
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,120
and and and and what not as intelligence

673
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,100
as a language we got to know what

674
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,620
keywords to put into your RSS feed in

675
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,879
order to find the same stuff that these

676
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,840
people are looking for and that takes

677
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,130
time I mean you can't just take any

678
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,620
security operations analyst and say okay

679
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,900
build me a feed okay well they have to

680
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,139
watch the feeds first to understand what

681
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,550
the language is gonna be even I mean

682
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,110
some of our first level analysts they

683
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:09,610
came in and I said listen I really need

684
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:14,100
you to look for a sload tell me like how

685
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:19,120
do you even spell that yes no right so

686
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,189
you can leverage this from a collection

687
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,169
source and then you can share it out

688
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:28,900
right and then the other way the other

689
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:31,240
one that we share so we talked about

690
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,340
kill chain diamond model and the Oh sent

691
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh sent flies around a lot

692
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:40,030
the humans are humming right

693
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,530
conversationally we share a lot of data

694
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,870
that we just don't really realize we're

695
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,620
doing because we do it so naturally

696
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:51,100
right so it goes back to that system one

697
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:54,310
how write the the the what is in the

698
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,929
context of the dialogue and we you guys

699
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,639
actually did it all day today I observed

700
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,980
it was it was kind of cool is gonna do

701
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,930
it right up but you guys actually shared

702
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,390
a ton of Intel

703
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,800
today between each other and you don't

704
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,090
even really realize you're doing it but

705
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,210
that's actually what you did today you

706
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,610
you got together and you told some dirty

707
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,290
jokes and the setting of thing and

708
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,209
bitched about work and blah blah blah

709
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,520
but in reality at the end of the day you

710
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,690
had conversations with people that you

711
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,110
were interested in connecting with

712
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,250
because you wanted to pick their brain I

713
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,639
do it all the time from from that

714
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,870
perspective in fact shoot out at my last

715
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,520
conference because I wasn't at the

716
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,840
conference enough I already knew all the

717
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,060
technical stuff I wasn't there for the

718
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,399
technical stuff I had a mission in mind

719
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,050
there were specific people that I had to

720
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,570
see at a specific time I know this

721
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,030
sounds very CIA but they were doing

722
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,770
their own thing right so they're in

723
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:47,620
their talks or doing whatever but it was

724
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,240
critical to some of the things that I'm

725
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,729
building at work that I met with those

726
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,330
people I had to share the intelligence

727
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,559
the

728
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,418
things that were on my mind and the

729
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,010
things that were on their mind and so

730
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:01,440
because we do it so naturally we really

731
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:07,750
don't we really don't give it the value

732
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:10,419
and we don't really recognize when we're

733
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:13,600
doing it's very it's very system one so

734
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:17,799
so that's the what right or that's the

735
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:25,870
how this is the what and then the WHO

736
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:27,299
and the when you know I've been told

737
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,518
several times

738
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:32,230
well intelligence needs to do this

739
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,059
really you know it's the first time I've

740
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,370
ever talked to you as a customer so

741
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:38,830
prior to me wasting my time and yours I

742
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,629
have no idea what's on your mind so when

743
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:45,010
you talk about the who the when and the

744
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:48,010
where that's all very relationship

745
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:50,559
specific right the u.s. cert when they

746
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,360
sent out their notification and all of a

747
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,590
sudden boo there's new vulnerability and

748
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,360
everybody goes running to make sure what

749
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,939
was the latest one or was the one that

750
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:04,389
you came out RDP something like that

751
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:06,580
whatever that came from an external

752
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,620
entity that they don't really care about

753
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,029
who the consumer as they already kind of

754
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,580
know that the consumers probably so many

755
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:17,039
insecurity relations so from an

756
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:20,168
intelligence perspective as an analyst

757
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,620
your who what where when why and how are

758
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:26,409
in constant that's why I kind of drew it

759
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:29,469
as a I don't know cross that's

760
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:31,510
constantly doing this because I'm gonna

761
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,610
take data and get data and move data and

762
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,049
receive data from external entities I've

763
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,418
got an internal entities

764
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:39,519
I've got ad hoc sharing which is system

765
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:41,830
one and then I've got scheduled sharing

766
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,799
and all of that is very I cannot I

767
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,350
cannot come up here and tell you how to

768
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,730
do that because I'm not at your

769
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,209
organization I don't know who your

770
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,980
affiliates are I don't know what your

771
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,130
relationships are within your security

772
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,289
groups but what I can tell you is that

773
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:00,970
those those those are constantly

774
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:02,620
happening so when you're when you if

775
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,029
you're not an intelligence analyst and

776
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,209
you're trying to figure out why your

777
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:07,309
intelligence analyst

778
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,659
constantly at an a a meeting it's

779
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,730
probably because this is always

780
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:13,010
happening all at once that was another

781
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:18,320
joke no tough crowd

782
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:20,120
damn there's no tough but some examples

783
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,360
of external entities might be your ice

784
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,529
axe you guys know about the ice axe yes

785
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,299
no okay I sex there an external entity

786
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:32,630
we talk to them all the time most

787
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:34,700
organizations do it's one of the big the

788
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,840
big things your your VPS and your

789
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,669
managers would be like what you got to

790
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,740
get them gotta get eaten got to get into

791
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:41,059
your ice axe your internal stuff you

792
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,820
know it depends on who the customer is

793
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:45,668
that could be right it could be your

794
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,720
soccer analyst your threat hunters

795
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:50,270
policy and development could come

796
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,520
through and ask for you know metrics on

797
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,830
what what are the most relevant breaches

798
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,750
of the day compared to what we see

799
00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:02,750
internally so that maybe they want to

800
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:06,640
write a new policy schedule cheering an

801
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:08,989
example of schedule sharing so right

802
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,359
going back to your internal security

803
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:13,368
systems right they update on a cron

804
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,750
there's there's a certain timer that

805
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:16,639
goes off so that would be that would be

806
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,649
a concept of a schedule sharing when I

807
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,830
do my own research and I and I update

808
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:25,069
certain taxonomy x' and in my own in my

809
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:27,830
own systems that's on a cron right and

810
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,070
so that all the the sharing and

811
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:32,210
distribution is also on a crime because

812
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,290
that's just the way I determine it I

813
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,659
don't want to send out a bunch of

814
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,800
individual emails periodically

815
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,950
throughout the day I'm just gonna send

816
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,070
them all on at 6 a.m. right or you know

817
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:45,020
you're ad-hoc sharing that's that goes

818
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,300
back to the slack channels it could be

819
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,969
scheduled you could have a ad hoc

820
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,730
schedule to conference over slack about

821
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:54,250
the RDP vulnerability and everybody

822
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,530
agrees to it but that's all I had a hawk

823
00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:00,190
so that is that that is primarily the

824
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,020
who what where when why how of

825
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,520
intelligence at a very high level

826
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:07,550
without explaining any of my own

827
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,990
personal TTP or systems or breaching my

828
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,820
confidentiality agreements with my

829
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:16,118
company all the other stuff so we have

830
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,119
20 minutes

831
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:23,230
it was o'clock do we have any questions

832
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:26,670
at all probably not

833
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,670
oh we have one okay I'm surprised

834
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,740
so right so going back to education

835
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,510
awareness and enrichment it depends on

836
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,069
the customer and how they like to run

837
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:55,530
their run their show right it goes back

838
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:58,680
to that that kill chain course of action

839
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,180
matrix your and it might even boil down

840
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,799
to your skill sets in your shop right

841
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,960
like maybe you can only do detection and

842
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,860
response and prevention just wouldn't

843
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,210
work because it

844
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,250
I don't know effects a certain

845
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,500
application you know I've worked at

846
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,420
certain shops and that not Blue Cross

847
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,680
where they wouldn't secure certain

848
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,260
systems or respond to certain things

849
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,940
primarily because oh well let's just say

850
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:25,530
the systems were too old to do anything

851
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:26,760
about right so but I get asks that are

852
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,190
all over the map man

853
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,470
I'll get asked you know K can you share

854
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,060
me some engineering knowledge you know

855
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,910
I'm trying to I'm trying to set up this

856
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,370
this application to track my own Intel

857
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:41,160
how did you build it right and so it's

858
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:44,130
so it really ranges this is where this

859
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,069
is where I when originally I started to

860
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:50,690
talk I said I'm not really cool with the

861
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:54,180
term cyber threat intelligence because

862
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,320
I'll share all kinds of stuff for

863
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,730
interests all kinds of stuff on a

864
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,130
regular basis and to me because I've

865
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:02,610
been doing it for the last four or five

866
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:05,760
years data becomes data right like a lot

867
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,990
of people are very focused on what I

868
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,120
would consider to be in the threat

869
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,680
hunting sock realm or like the security

870
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,850
engineering security architecture realm

871
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:19,890
you know but I'm out in some wackadoo

872
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:23,750
land so to answer your question it all

873
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,750
depends on the customer right

874
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:51,010
I knew this was gonna come up this is

875
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,200
the part where where where there's

876
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,940
there's there's a tightrope and then

877
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,919
there's a pit full of lions and they

878
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,810
haven't been eaten or fed in like a week

879
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,810
and now I've got to kind of like do this

880
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,430
so yes we have gotten to that point

881
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,220
where we do create certain products or

882
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:13,210
share intelligence out right that goes

883
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:15,730
back to though the who what where when

884
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,280
why how that cross of the different

885
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,450
entities and then it goes back all the

886
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,410
way up to the beginning of the slide

887
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:26,109
deck of the of the how we share it P TLP

888
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:29,680
and taxonomy I can't I can't stress

889
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:33,400
enough how important those things are

890
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,589
right because and in those business

891
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,630
agreements and business arrangements how

892
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:39,849
important those things aren't right like

893
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,050
if you have affiliates or subsidiaries

894
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,580
and you've got certain business

895
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,040
agreements and business arrangements

896
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,830
that say it's okay to do this then

897
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,460
whatever technical system or process you

898
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:53,380
determine is easiest for your team to to

899
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,530
manage is how you're going to ultimately

900
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,630
get that done right so yes we have

901
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,790
gotten to that point and we have certain

902
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,230
things I've got but no the reason why I

903
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,310
like researching OSINT because it

904
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,470
doesn't really matter at that point

905
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,049
right as long as I reference it we're

906
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,848
good to go but yeah we have gotten to

907
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,810
that point an ionization helps a little

908
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,609
bit

909
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,770
I think that's were that when I was

910
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,380
saying the the vendors like the

911
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,990
antivirus they're kind of like this

912
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:23,619
hybrid TLP because they got that sample

913
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:27,189
from somewhere right I mean if it wasn't

914
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:28,510
my shop it was your shop so but they

915
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,650
anonymize it right they don't tell you

916
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,810
where it came from just that they have

917
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,060
this this data are you working on a

918
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:37,349
specific project that you're trying to

919
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,349
get off the ground

920
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,790
without getting you you know into the

921
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,790
lion lion pit better give me though

922
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:54,910
which ones

923
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:57,940
the foster the COTS sweet you need to

924
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:59,950
talk to me and and Brett will tell you I

925
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,740
am the worst person to talk to about it

926
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,930
because I've been seeped in it for like

927
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:11,049
three or four years now and it's all I

928
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:15,310
promote not to I hate to get on my

929
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:18,609
soapbox but just giving me a billion

930
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,799
friggin indicators does not help me in a

931
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:22,990
security operation center when the

932
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,200
taxonomy tagging in context is still not

933
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:27,790
there it's still garbage it's still

934
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,649
garbage if you can't relate it to

935
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:36,609
something or even and this is something

936
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:39,280
if you can't even spend the time to make

937
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:40,900
it something new then I don't want I

938
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,970
don't want I just don't want it I don't

939
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,490
want it I've got to a point where a

940
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,830
million freaking indicators if you're

941
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,419
sitting on a warehouse of a million

942
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:52,660
friggin indicators and I gotta set the

943
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,359
confidence level on ingest to 90 to 95

944
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:58,830
percent or higher and you've got a

945
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,299
million indicators that means what like

946
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:04,330
nine hundred thousand of them are

947
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,740
garbage would would I don't need that

948
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,970
that's not selling point to me anymore

949
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,470
you know when I first when I first

950
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,020
started down this track right I wasn't

951
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,399
always an intelligence analyst I mean

952
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,690
obviously twenty years ago I had nothing

953
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,930
to do with computers

954
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:22,960
I just want to rock out I would have

955
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:25,509
said to a vendor wow that's amazing and

956
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,369
now I actually vet vendors based on the

957
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,350
ocean that I find I was just having this

958
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:31,690
conversation with I think the palette

959
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:37,118
also guy was here we were talking about

960
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:39,609
unit 42 I said I now look at vendors for

961
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,830
what they publish because I'm purchasing

962
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:44,590
your skillset not your tool and if you

963
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,420
can't display to me an up depth in

964
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,180
research on a piece of malware or

965
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,770
whatever then I can't I don't know if I

966
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,098
can necessarily trust your product

967
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,319
because

968
00:41:51,099 --> 00:42:00,549
what are you doing in the background

969
00:41:52,319 --> 00:42:02,619
right so I can get with you on some of

970
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:08,559
my research for that for the for the

971
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:09,940
FASTA but that I can do and I can tell

972
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,200
you which ones work really well and

973
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,880
which ones you don't even wanna deal

974
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,089
with because there are some that are

975
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,249
just they're garbage no I shouldn't say

976
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,529
that actually that was actually that was

977
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:24,459
actually really followed me there just

978
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:26,890
not um well supported some of the other

979
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:29,559
products right they're all great efforts

980
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,660
it's anything that I've ever used Foss

981
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,450
is far and above and beyond anything I

982
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,950
can produce on my period so kudos to

983
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:43,149
anybody that that that goes down that

984
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:46,058
road anything else yeah it's another

985
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:49,749
good one so that goes back to the ad hoc

986
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:51,009
and scheduled it's really hard and it's

987
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:53,109
really hard to put a process around

988
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:54,789
something like that because eventually

989
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:56,200
what happens is you'll be following the

990
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,729
process and something's gonna get stuck

991
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,499
in the process then you're gonna adjust

992
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:00,910
the process only to realize that you

993
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:02,558
need to do it just it back to what you

994
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,078
had and it's just like this constant

995
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,390
moving target so what I try to do is I

996
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:12,880
try to I try to I try to collect and

997
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:15,249
prioritize I tried to give you actually

998
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,719
Brian asked me that question a long time

999
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:25,569
ago he said he said why is why is your

1000
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:27,819
research a lot of your research threat

1001
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:30,670
levels undefined because I'm not your

1002
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:32,109
organization I don't know right so some

1003
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,640
of that comes back to your own or -

1004
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,828
right like whoa I don't know what your

1005
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,469
shop is so I could give you a bunch of

1006
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:41,650
Linux information but if you're not

1007
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:43,420
really a heavy Linux shop then no matter

1008
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,890
where I prioritize it in the stack it's

1009
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,519
just kind of irrelevant so I tried to

1010
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:50,769
like in my own research I collect um

1011
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,430
what I might myopically think is a cool

1012
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:55,359
CVE

1013
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:58,779
I collect Osen on threat actors I'll

1014
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:02,369
collect malware reports like from Talos

1015
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:02,369
or unit 42 or

1016
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:08,959
fireEye will sometimes do reports and

1017
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:10,219
then I'll collect on data breaches and I

1018
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:12,319
collect data breaches because I worked

1019
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:15,559
in healthcare right so it's just kind of

1020
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,839
like an ant roll the natural fit and

1021
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:20,659
then what I try to do is I try to either

1022
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,249
do it in an ad hoc way and what I mean

1023
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,469
by ad hoc is that I make the information

1024
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:27,558
available to you one of the things we

1025
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:30,799
realized was that when I started doing

1026
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,769
the the Intel work again was that people

1027
00:44:30,799 --> 00:44:35,809
were waiting for me to distribute the

1028
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,308
information and I said that's really

1029
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:38,659
kind of backwards because you don't know

1030
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,079
what I'm doing in the in the middle of

1031
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:43,729
my day I could be sick I could be

1032
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,469
whatever right I could be working on

1033
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:47,479
something else entirely and now the

1034
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:49,009
information has stopped at me so if it

1035
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:52,038
comes in through an email but it needs

1036
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:53,839
to be distributed out so what I did is I

1037
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:55,339
kind of worked it backwards and said no

1038
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,009
I'm going to give you access to the

1039
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:59,869
systems that I use and I'll put you on

1040
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:03,949
the mailing lists that I use so you're

1041
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:06,949
not waiting for me and so like Bret

1042
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:08,929
works on a completely different team if

1043
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:11,449
he has access to the information he can

1044
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:13,880
vet and then I'm I'm now opening the

1045
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:15,709
information up to people and then he can

1046
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,869
vet and prioritize what he thinks would

1047
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:20,058
be relevant to his role within the

1048
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:22,039
organization versus me trying to

1049
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:23,779
determine what he thinks is relevant if

1050
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:25,219
that if that makes sense so it's kind of

1051
00:45:23,779 --> 00:45:26,929
like a really backwards way to do it

1052
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:28,640
like where most of the time you'll try

1053
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:31,489
to work a threat from like a high

1054
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,169
priority critical down to a I'll get to

1055
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:39,049
tomorrow because it's an informational

1056
00:45:33,169 --> 00:45:41,839
type of alert where I become and a lot

1057
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:44,299
of it comes from big data to right I

1058
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,339
mean what's Big Data volume velocity and

1059
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:50,239
what diversity or something like that

1060
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:52,159
and like I'm inundated with data on a

1061
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,709
regular basis and for me to try to

1062
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,819
figure out what you know like the

1063
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:58,249
vulnerability guys that's easy

1064
00:45:55,819 --> 00:46:00,919
prioritize that to the vulnerability

1065
00:45:58,249 --> 00:46:03,049
guys but give them guys and gals I

1066
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:04,609
should say give them access to the

1067
00:46:03,049 --> 00:46:06,319
things so that if they're sitting on

1068
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:09,109
their thumbs they're not waiting for me

1069
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:12,859
to get done with working with the threat

1070
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:14,179
hunters on a malware report right so I

1071
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:16,940
don't know if I answered your question

1072
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:18,230
but that that's that's kind of how I

1073
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,839
got to the point where I'm just like ah

1074
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,579
I don't care anymore here take it just

1075
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:25,099
take the data you do it because at the

1076
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,329
end of the day the the the customer is

1077
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,280
the one that's gonna be reacting to the

1078
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:31,369
data that mean right so if I can get it

1079
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,819
to him faster I figured I was probably

1080
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:36,980
being more value added to the two of the

1081
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:38,869
organization as a whole as opposed to

1082
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,579
you waiting for me to get get it to you

1083
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:43,220
figuring out what's important in your

1084
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:44,780
day good I'll tell you this what their

1085
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,799
skill sets at work I have no idea what

1086
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,770
they're talking about they're speaking

1087
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:52,040
of moon language to them like you know

1088
00:46:48,770 --> 00:47:08,900
so I'll let you figure I know so I don't

1089
00:46:52,040 --> 00:47:14,270
know if that helped so so that goes back

1090
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:24,579
to - I'm sorry anymore IDI it goes kind

1091
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:28,400
of to Ed's answer yes and no so

1092
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:32,720
sometimes when you consider education

1093
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:35,150
awareness and enrichment is is in order

1094
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,879
to meet that strategic goal is it better

1095
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,579
if I facilitate the communications and

1096
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:44,300
set up that infrastructure versus

1097
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:47,540
actually sending you that data so kind

1098
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,260
of like you're my sec slack channel

1099
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,369
right you can go in there I'm making an

1100
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,819
assumption because I've never been there

1101
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,130
I just

1102
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:56,660
OTS and you can see people on it right

1103
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,430
I'm assuming that you're not always

1104
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,230
talking about pizza and what you had for

1105
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,810
lunch right you're kind of like sharing

1106
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:04,819
whatever so from an education awareness

1107
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,430
and enrichment it behooves us

1108
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:08,420
organizationally and it's still

1109
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:12,859
something that we're working on

1110
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:17,300
internally to develop a channel that's

1111
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:18,859
specifically for security Ops groups to

1112
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,540
share those things back and forth right

1113
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:23,089
because I don't really I mean I can

1114
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,910
right Splunk code I'm not I'm not I'm

1115
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:26,299
not like Andy you know or or Brant or

1116
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,999
Brian

1117
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:31,429
whatever I'm bad I can't spend that

1118
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:33,979
stuff up as well as they can right but

1119
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:36,920
if I can connect those two people now I

1120
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:39,410
facilitated in the sharing right so

1121
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,869
sometimes you have to look at the the e

1122
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,549
AE strategical is it better for me to

1123
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:45,650
consider what architecture or

1124
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:50,359
infrastructure is going to facilitate

1125
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:53,299
that sharing easier or do I have to be

1126
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:56,719
the one to actually do the give and give

1127
00:48:53,299 --> 00:49:01,130
and give and take so but yes that's

1128
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:04,339
something I think it's critical and to

1129
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:07,819
have that and that goes back to the

1130
00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:09,769
reflection of your threat actor that

1131
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:12,469
whole thing about the copycats I was

1132
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:14,808
talking about to your security operation

1133
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:16,069
centers right you have a mix of skill

1134
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:17,059
sets you have somebody that's been there

1135
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:18,439
for a while and knows how to do

1136
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:19,699
everything because they know how to do

1137
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:21,828
everything they don't necessarily always

1138
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:22,999
have time to teach to new people new

1139
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,259
people are struggling it would be great

1140
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:27,948
if they could just plug into a channel

1141
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:30,140
and talk to someone right so yeah we

1142
00:49:27,949 --> 00:49:31,369
definitely are with that that's in the

1143
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,299
works can't tell you what it's called

1144
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,519
but there's actually official

1145
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:37,579
documentation and and there's lots of

1146
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:41,569
support for it so but because it's at a

1147
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:45,229
very very very high level across lots of

1148
00:49:41,569 --> 00:49:46,699
orgs right it takes a lot of time we

1149
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:48,410
have to pilot it proof of concept

1150
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:50,359
because that's a different kind of share

1151
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,038
to write when you start talking about

1152
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:53,449
intelligence analysts sharing with

1153
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:54,559
intelligence analysts we're creating

1154
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,739
something for a customer that's one

1155
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,279
thing but when you start talking about

1156
00:49:56,739 --> 00:50:02,929
teams now needing to communicate it

1157
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:04,719
almost because do you know what do you

1158
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:09,109
know what an you know what an a wax is

1159
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:11,390
okay then a wax will talk to several

1160
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:13,369
different squadrons and those squadrons

1161
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,618
have to work in conjunction with each

1162
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:17,569
other and they use the AWACS as an

1163
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:19,130
intermediary but they'll also talk

1164
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:20,538
squadron the squadron and that's the

1165
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,339
kind of communication you're talking

1166
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:24,199
about when it comes to sharing like

1167
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:26,209
defensive techniques or stuff like that

1168
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:29,929
because now you're talking about

1169
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:31,189
enriching a team versus a single

1170
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:34,579
intelligence person that might work for

1171
00:50:31,189 --> 00:50:36,330
the organization or you know so I just

1172
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:39,720
they're doing

1173
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:42,930
they're doing this so but I'm like Brian

1174
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,450
and and Brent and and and and Paige and

1175
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,870
Andy and stuff I'm always available

1176
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,779
jibber jabber

1177
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:51,750
right something I can obviously not not

1178
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,660
to be like CIA spook type thing I can I

1179
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:57,570
can go so far and and and and and give

1180
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:59,009
you some of my conceptual thoughts of of

1181
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,170
those things yeah but yeah we're

1182
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,670
definitely doing that yeah definitely

1183
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:06,930
it's in fact I think it's I think it's

1184
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:10,160
critical so yeah that's it that's Intel

1185
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,160
that's what we do home track
