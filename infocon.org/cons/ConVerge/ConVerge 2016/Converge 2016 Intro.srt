I was everybody everybody good

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,948
alright so welcome to year three of
converge

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,080
so it's been a labor of love this year
so we've been like pressing to get

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,959
everything done and working really hard

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
we're happy to have everybody back and
we've actually beating our numbers from

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,860
last year so that's good we've put more
attendance in we put more into it so

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,620
hopefully you guys find good value

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,099
we have some amazing speakers I I wasn't
a b-side one in this year i got the

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,219
lucky enough to go over there and I feel
like we have you no content that you

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,350
know rival that and that's a thousand
person con so don't give you some to

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,280
give you an idea we were going to do
probably 400 people through the doors

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,020
these three days so they do a thousand
people and I think our content rivals

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,259
there's and I think that speaks to this
group this community

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,659
the local of the community so I mean
hands show of hands for everybody clap

17
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,689
for everybody that squeaks that
volunteers

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,220
the volunteers I helped put it together

19
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,440
Adrian's up your recording again he you
know you know make sure you think Adrian

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,970
because he turned down Chaka Khan to be
here and Chaka Khan's in Hawaii

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,990
so yeah you know what I saw it so it
drains your recording for us and so

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,309
that's awesome

23
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,310
