Dave Stokes I'm a community manager

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,680
mysql products for those room last field
for a while you might remember me i see

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,990
the certification manager for my for
mysql a be so if you have a

certification 4554 around that time .
you might have my name on the bottom of

6
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,559
your certification of my email address

handle that Stoker

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,480
I have the slides up as of today
slideshare net / David and Stokes i have

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,779
a blog and open source deviate at
wordpress.com you have any questions

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,879
please bring them out

11
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,419
I you won't throw me off a stench
stand-up comic

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,660
I might make them your mama joke but i
won't throw me off and I'd rather you

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,779
interrupt me and get your question
answered and have you take it home and

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,270
let it boil for a long time

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,610
so what are you talking about today well
my skill 57 came out in october and

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,179
we've made a lot of security changes and
they've been impacting people in a lot

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,770
of different ways

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,130
how many folks here are our database
administrators or have to deal with

19
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,330
keeping the database say okay I'm
basically i'm going to talk about the

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,149
main overviews I can begin each one
these features for about a three-hour

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,229
talk each pushing bore you to death but
it started before you ever upgrade mysql

22
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,530
do yourself a favor and do a backup
reason the release notes because we do

23
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,619
put since they're about things have
changed and will bite you in the butt

24
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,619
double check your hardware status

25
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,279
I can stroll swimming better

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,850
i recently I had a customer down the
street come to me complaining the

27
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,399
database is running slow walk in the
computer room

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,270
the radial our array had all the lights
flashing they were losing to just the

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,899
same time but it wasn't the right away
that was the problem with the databases

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,950
flow so make sure you're diagnosing all
your hardware make sure everything is

31
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,208
working great for you

32
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,420
make sure there's no bad memories make
sure you're ready to go

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,720
make sure you have plenty of time to
practice on an old machine

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,739
now i do some more back up and start the
upgrade

35
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:27,580
so for those of you who march dbe folks
but your security folks

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,470
mysql it's kind of a hard target ticket
for security

37
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,950
all databases are designed to get data
in and out there not really designed to

38
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,760
be secure

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,959
there's a lot of loopholes in general
it's for us it's usually authentication

40
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,410
we'll talk about that a little bit and
privileges

41
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,090
usually people are too generous giving
away privileges and that is inviting you

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,900
in the rear

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,010
also if you are doing secure connections
like SL there's some hoops the juncture

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,590
to make sure that you get all the
authentication you want

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,020
let's go

46
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,680
education system when you connect to the
box the first thing the server does the

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,590
check your hopes is your host
blacklisted

48
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,580
if not it's gonna let you in and let's
look at a hash of the username and

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,750
password

50
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,190
it's not exactly rigorous there so if
the host is ok and there's a good user

51
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,120
name

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,800
he'll let you win very permissive may
not be the same account years ago I

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,180
found this out to the boss of mine was
doing the year and reviews for all

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,550
employees and didn't know that he had
different permissions at home than he

55
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,560
had at work so I instead essentially had
him locked out of stuff he thought he

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,000
should have permission to

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,980
fortunately my predecessors had set it
up so that Bob at ten . 10 wild card was

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,410
not the same as Bob at the company name

59
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,880
unfortunately to get through this you
have to hand audit which is a good

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,920
practice anyway every so often

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,980
by the way if you've never hand on it is
something that you think is secured has

62
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,510
been great for a long time

63
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,780
whether it's a database or not it can be
frightening what you'll find in their

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,380
privileges in the database arena normal
you have to have privileges to do things

65
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,089
privileges to read that column select
courage update privileges to change

66
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,690
stuff

67
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,330
delete privileges packages like PHP
admin which is a very popular piece of

68
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:28,210
software for masculine administration
used to give all the users by default

69
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,400
drop privilege that doesn't scare you
change the word privilege to baby or

70
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,340
laptop drop baby drop laptop

71
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,150
this means people who get rid of your
data for you when you don't want them to

72
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,859
so my best advice be stingy with
privileges

73
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,040
don't hand them out to you have to it's
easier to apologize to rebuild your

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,450
database all the time

75
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,820
also I like to recommend we'll talk
about a little bit more use proxy

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,930
accounts if you have an accountant
county department that tends to scale up

77
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,200
and scale down with a seasonal flow of
business use a proxy account set up one

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,139
for accounting and then when you get Bob
Julie and

79
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,520
mass in for the accounting seasonal work
you just property over to the county

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,900
account

81
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,289
you don't have to set up individual
cancer all these folks

82
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:28,389
ok 57 came out last October line schools
always been kind of nasty

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,120
you'll see why on upgrades so we've made
the changes and for the most part

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,819
they've been received rather well we
didn't catch your pimple people short

85
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:43,120
but i'll show you where the problems are
the best things about 57 is better

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,729
performance we now have a native json
data type parallel replication within a

87
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,719
database

88
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:55,719
by the way if you don't know my skill
taken over by or about six years ago a

89
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,740
lot of us originally thought oh my God
why didn't need another database oracle

90
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,379
has 13 database properties they came in
took a look at it and said hey you're

91
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,199
really good here but you need some
engineering count-out here

92
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,650
go staff up to wrap this up we're making
money for oracle we're hiring our

93
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,979
development staff is probably four times
larger than it was six years ago

94
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,979
RQ a step down from person and a half to
about 30 people were always looking for

95
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,969
talent so see me afterwards or go to
oracle com with the career section

96
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:37,779
biggest change is now when you install a
fresh installation of mysql it forces a

97
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,279
root password on you

98
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,139
now the other day I didn't install it
gave me n lb cube edited it up to the

99
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:51,849
password to record this in the log file
usually bar log MySQL dot log Hut court

100
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:57,280
login with it changes why do we do this
well a lot

101
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,940
folks are going to the club now and the
after cloud provider hate me up a new

102
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,750
database

103
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,260
well usually on that type of
installation in the past we just gave

104
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,260
you a root account with no password

105
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,820
so that's like giving liquor and car
keys to a 14 year old boy on a friday

106
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,419
night

107
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,419
not a not a good thing

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,479
also we used to force on you and
anonymous account anonymous account is

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,870
an account without a username and
without a password

110
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,669
so not only will give them liquor and
car keys we also give the fireworks in

111
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:38,289
the lumen pistol with the anonymous
account

112
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,220
depending on the system setup you can
get into all sorts of mischief but you

113
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,120
had access to the box and if you didn't
even have explicit permission to do

114
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,140
stuff you had basically the having you
watch people see what they're doing the

115
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,750
process list and pitch away in there
also used to give you a test database

116
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,460
whether you want it or not

117
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,260
so with the anonymous account and test
database it's a curiosity a fairly

118
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,550
clever hacker could watch what's going
on the system and probably run tcp/ip

119
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,250
dumping it enough to get dangerous

120
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:19,660
well we no longer do the test account we
no longer do the anonymous account for

121
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:28,550
forcing the root password so things are
turning up a lot so

122
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,980
as I mentioned earlier earlier during
upgrader install weed right wipe out the

123
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,070
root password - sometimes not a good
idea

124
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,720
now if you are doing install and you
don't want a random password

125
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,370
you put in the option - - unsecured and
it creates the root account without a

126
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,330
password

127
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,080
so if you used to think before 570 want
to work the same way in your script

128
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:01,400
- - and secure user names used to be up
to 16 characters that was good

129
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,480
twenty years ago we started out your
name now got longer

130
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,790
right now we support 32 characters law
we have a lot of customers saying hey

131
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,849
where're you now using corporate forced
identities that are longer and 16 please

132
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:24,860
increase that also we added the if not
exists on the create user statement

133
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,530
so if you are doing things like muscular
jumper other program and saving off the

134
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,530
user files and bring anything back

135
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,280
that helps this also is very helpful if
you are

136
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,270
transfer acceptability of production
environment to a test environment or

137
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,380
vice versa

138
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,840
and you want to bring over users lets
you keep up keep you from wiping out the

139
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:56,470
old version of these be a real pain in
the butt copy things over also

140
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,490
a new alter user command or expanded
alter user command

141
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,270
I was all security features you will see
later we had a couple way to be able to

142
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,689
access that the alter user who at
localhost account lock to the way to

143
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,770
lock up someone's account if you have
someone that leaves for someone gets

144
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,180
injured and you want to keep that
account you can use put that on there if

145
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,880
you have new users you have to set up
accounts for but you don't want them

146
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
having access to you can train them

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,390
that's a great way of doing it I used to
be used to do all sorts of nasty tricks

148
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,270
to get in there you have people who put
after behind usernames using VI not

149
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,270
really great practice but that will make
do

150
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,700
also if you have everything sealed up
and you're not worried about outside

151
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,540
threats

152
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:56,530
you always have threats inside slipping
your data now we support at the cell and

153
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:03,819
TLS with hope with a open at the cell
and the asshole

154
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,650
we're in the midst of changing this if
you have any feedback let me know how

155
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,640
he's openssl with our enterprise product
which is the product you get with a

156
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,420
support contract and raising asshole
with the community version which is the

157
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,479
free to use by the way when oracle took
over my SQL they promised they would

158
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,390
keep the courting and open and free
version of MySQL we're going to keep

159
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,030
doing that forever as long as we can
that responsibility to the European

160
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:37,510
Court ran on 2015 my bosses say yeah we
will keep having a free version of MySQL

161
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:44,890
five people on it offroad hands if you
go through the my skill that user table

162
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,400
you'll see that there's no longer a
password column

163
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,569
why is that well no wonder the password
can be a authentication string you might

164
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,900
be passing a hash you might be passing
some other token and we change that too

165
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,140
to reflect the change unfortunately if
you're used to the old way you have

166
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,449
noticed that before you get stuck
password rotation

167
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,980
I for company policies that you will
change your passwords every 90 days that

168
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,980
will have at least one uppercase or
lowercase the one special character

169
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,260
you can now do that might feel now
supports that you can make it complex as

170
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,460
you want

171
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,260
after lifetime presents measured in days
if you set it to 0 and no rotation and

172
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:38,660
set it to null it goes to whatever the
system standard is also if you want you

173
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,920
can also ban certain years words or
letters or longer from being your

174
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,270
password files

175
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,750
I don't know how many of you actually
found out that everyone in your

176
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,480
department using the word password or
quality or 123456 and passwords for

177
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,820
certain four letter words between now
bandos what you do is you enable strong

178
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,770
password verification

179
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,930
you can turn this down or up if you need
/ number of character length the

180
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,930
complexity in mixed cases or special
characters

181
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,780
what you do is you put these special
words in a password file even be mixed

182
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,010
case them it will recognize that them
and a lot much use those as a password

183
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,200
many many many years ago when I was an
undergraduate I was hanging around a

184
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,280
hero lines shop and they had implemented
random password and unfortunately the

185
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,420
first lady in their Department got big
bottom of the first randomly generated

186
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,050
password password and six weeks later
cut large rear as your password and they

187
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,189
had to prove the source code to her and
her lawyer that it was randomly

188
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,590
generated will put yourself in that
position also

189
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:02,970
to support a lot of authentication
plugin and we're coming with more left

190
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,160
like i mentioned in the old days you
just add password

191
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,160
well now things are getting more and
more complex

192
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,540
we support external authentication

193
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,220
this means you're going to pass it off
to prevent like an ldap server or

194
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,240
Windows Server use pam parker bro
something like that

195
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,140
so you're taking your password and we
have a mechanism to push it off to

196
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,520
whatever you're doing approval from in
getting the approval or disapproval back

197
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,150
we also have Crocs users i mentioned
earlier that lets you set up as i

198
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,040
mentioned the account example ways to
have accounts out the other kind of

199
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,140
generic function accounts but they'll
give people their individual account

200
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,680
here's a list of several the plug-in
that we have right now made of

201
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,760
authentication

202
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,140
I would commit mass of the password
against the pats a password column

203
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,199
should say authentication column for the
capture oh by the way the old hatch for

204
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,330
the pre 4.1 mysql password has done away
with 57

205
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,890
how about you see a way of those prints
from the hashes the dictionary and get

206
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,830
your way into a server we have one that
does to a fish that's ha2 36 password

207
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:26,220
hashing venture company guarantee to you
that we also have one that prevents our

208
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,430
client connections to any account that
uses it why would you use this

209
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,370
maybe have stored procedures that are
used by multiple folks but you don't

210
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,160
want that stored procedure password
getting out

211
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,709
we also have a plug-in that lets you
send the password clear text without

212
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,240
hashing your encryption

213
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,010
this can be used by other plugins that
we haven't written yet or you might want

214
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,710
to write or are in the thing and let the
client figure out what's going on but

215
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,790
also dedicated overlay units socket and
we also have a very well documented

216
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,910
test plug in if you need to write your
own what your own company stuff

217
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,720
we have lots of details on there and how
to set the hook to go to get in either

218
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,720
an internal or external authentication

219
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,980
I at startup the server automatically
will generate server-side and

220
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,720
client-side ssl certificates and keep
files if the auto generate shirt

221
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,720
variable is enable why are we doing this

222
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,210
well we have more and more clients
coming to oracle and saying you know

223
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,030
it's great that you're doing all these
other things but we need everything

224
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,949
encrypted on the wire we can't trust you
know that the wire is incredible we need

225
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,730
to make sure that there's no one living
on the BPM

226
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:47,230
so please make sure that the cells there
as

227
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,220
in the old password hash has been
removed this is from my ask you all for

228
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,950
one and earlier if you really really
really need that to me there's some ways

229
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,980
i can show you how to get around that
but it's not a good idea

230
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:11,390
we also have support for multiple aes
encryption modes now table

231
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,510
action in the old days and I need to do
pc i work with Moscow 50 and 51

232
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,280
what I used to do they should have this
nice little routine on crip data and

233
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,670
throw it into a blob field any in a
table

234
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:31,160
well that was good enough 10-15 years
ago doesn't quite work now so we now

235
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,920
have at rest encryption for the energy
be tablespace by the way if you're

236
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,280
running my I Sam please come into the
21st century

237
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,290
convert over 1000 GB it's faster in all
cases it's crash resistant to that

238
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,470
passage compliance and for oracle
spending money

239
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,270
my family just 60 technology with
seventeen nineteen seventies

240
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,379
implementation

241
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,530
please my great now our table based
encryption uses a two-tier encryption

242
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,450
heat and say master encryption key a
tablespace teeth when the table is

243
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,600
encrypted table space key is encrypted
and stored in the table space header

244
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,360
now when you want to change that
interview the master encryption key to

245
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,679
decrypt the table space key encrypted
version table 50 never changes but the

246
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,590
math drink if you can you be changed as
required

247
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,990
we're using Oracle's she encryption
software that they've been using with

248
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:32,090
the Oracle innovating for 10-15 years
very stable very rugged and yes you

249
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,409
gotta pay for it

250
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,040
one of our competitors has a version of
table space encryption that's one layer

251
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,030
encryption

252
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,270
the third button guys at Google who
handed off the code to them and ran away

253
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,260
quickly

254
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,200
they also will charge you for the
management software if you want to learn

255
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,990
the table face and you're not good at
writing your own management software

256
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,980
you're going to have to pay for it right
now there is no open source key

257
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,570
management thought were out there

258
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,040
if anyone knows that includes that you
know and that is the hard part of the

259
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,940
equation

260
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,210
ok

261
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,600
voters

262
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,100
around for the security folks if you
have a database around make sure there's

263
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:16,820
multiple folks that know how to restore
the data your entire database restore

264
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:23,299
table or restore line we have some tool
like in the masculine utility my school

265
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,530
BB dip

266
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,980
they'll actually let you see
line-by-line differences in table and be

267
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,150
able to generate stuff to update the
information between servers that they're

268
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,260
out of whack

269
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,780
also to the most recently run queries
feel to be the most over on time if you

270
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,030
run something 10,000 times an hour and
you shave a tenth of the time off will

271
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,658
give you much more time Jonathan wants
the moment for four or five hours

272
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:55,039
also your DBA is worried about discretes
reading off a disk is a hundred thousand

273
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,350
times slower than reading out of memory

274
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,299
so this gentleman here could click his
fingers once the second 400,000 seconds

275
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,830
we can come back in the next month on
Tuesday and watch him through the

276
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,090
afternoon finish up

277
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:15,049
so yeah i'll be very sorry for you when
the fingers start pulling up

278
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:22,220
so database security is not
one-size-fits-all database

279
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,059
administrators good ones are paranoid
food security folks are paranoid

280
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,149
what will go wrong walk and go wrong at
the most spectacular time to do it

281
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,600
so make sure you have backups make sure
people know how to do stuff

282
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,970
the other thing I run into is people say
oh I read that Google does this for

283
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,940
facebook that that and that they

284
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,909
I want my company to be like facebook i
want my company like Google for their

285
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,320
form and do what they do

286
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,070
does not work folks they've evolved
system to work with what they do with on

287
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,539
a daily basis unless you are facebook or
you are Google you don't have the same

288
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,960
workload you don't have the same data
requirements you don't have the same

289
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,070
service level so

290
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,129
you don't see that or someone's doing
something I need to do exactly what

291
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,090
we're doing

292
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:16,179
it's good to look at it and copy what
they're doing it fits up not jamming

293
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,090
keep it in the back your mind

294
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,370
well we were

295
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,809
not really there wondering if I run into
a one good hour but I'm usually like to

296
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:29,610
run things short on the fly along with
Q&A as i know that's usually where

297
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,520
people have the where they want to get
the information problem if you want to

298
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,389
copy of the slides

299
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,390
not sure that's such David I'm Stokes
are paying me

300
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm always on twitter at Stoker by the
way to go back through tweets from two

301
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,800
years ago there was a nicole kidman
movie called Stoker

302
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,889
I had a lot of fun with their their
executive producer

303
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,309
I just want him to offer me even a
dollar for the twitter handle they

304
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,389
wouldn't do it there

305
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,880
cheap bastards let me go back to eat
something about red hair nudity two

306
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,059
years ago wasn't me though

307
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:14,100
so what mysql what Oracle what database
security questions cancer-free hooks for

308
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:32,850
your quiet of the best starting point a
chapter to the mysql manual

309
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,530
that's about 40 pages last time were
printed out of database security

310
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,879
practices

311
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,309
it talks about setting up accounts
running the server as the user mysql

312
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,910
Bitterroot people from Frank put that
figure and server

313
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,340
there's an entire litany of stuff in
that in that one chapter from there you

314
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,809
can branch out the books like the
magical administrator five or machinery

315
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,280
cabral that was the best practices you
on the net

316
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,480
what's going on but that those are two
probably to first stepping stones i tell

317
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
you to go

318
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:21,020
unfortunately know what's really funny
is there is a tuning script that was

319
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,870
written many many years ago that still
on the web

320
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,668
people download and they want to get the
my modern version of mysql and it gives

321
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:31,760
them all sorts of performance tuning
measurements to make absolutely no sense

322
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,500
of modern box

323
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,250
unfortunately because it's been out
there and it's googleable people still

324
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,020
use it in the runner box and then and
appointing see I've got a 16-core box

325
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,418
which we are running on one core problem

326
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:49,100
so I don't know any script like that
will tell you how bad you are doing but

327
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,600
the great thing is you're not going to
have your database sitting out on the

328
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,209
internet and protected by itself you're
gonna have it behind a firewall so 99%

329
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,230
of scripted out there aren't ever going
to see your box anyway so that's a big

330
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,950
big now

331
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,500
the gentleman

332
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,010
but the Moscow utilities which is a
bunch of free script we have in python

333
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,300
that lets you do things like copy
databases that application to automatic

334
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,750
bill we're all that we're talking about
trying to do an audit for that he said

335
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,170
yeah well it works on our box and have
20 users when you get to a government

336
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,400
site that have 200 or 2000 users use
kind of a pain about to do some of those

337
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,250
tests but I'm so nudging him trying to
get him to tackle that though

338
00:24:38,780 --> 00:25:15,350
mr. up the mysql running the energy
storage engine is adapted compliance PCI

339
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,520
compliant depends on your underway
implemented

340
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,870
I've got your two pci audits back with
older versions of MySQL and have been

341
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,590
how you put it into your honor is i know
several banks are running and credit

342
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,590
unions that are running my altar main
database

343
00:25:33,320 --> 00:26:11,750
I'm other

344
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,610
what is a normal employee and an Oracle
stockholder thank you for using oracle

345
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:22,580
encryption tool as for ripping out
oracle and throw in mysql it depends on

346
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,960
your installation

347
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,130
usually the database part of it that
actual software is the real cheap end of

348
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,030
the deal

349
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,020
I the processes and procedures and the
policies and getting all that we done

350
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:46,730
easily killed it required

351
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:07,760
yeah yeah

352
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,600
hey there

353
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,230
the servers like having an aircraft
carrier and my skills were like having

354
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,850
an f-150 pickup truck

355
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,000
if you really need to take 5,000 people
across an ocean and generate electricity

356
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,860
and have people land on your roof

357
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,979
it's great if you don't need that my
skill might be your choice

358
00:27:21,980 --> 00:28:06,050
although all horrible and like years ago

359
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,830
water companies that had gone on to the
internet and triple their sales and then

360
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,360
triple them again and I walked into a
database administrator meeting and had a

361
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,439
huge conference room and they told me
all the senior oracle DBA in this room

362
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,630
the junior dba's are in the room next
door

363
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,860
slave so we're ready to hear all this
wisdom and it was your guys's mysql

364
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,820
Billy has anyone seen Billy and Billy
was off changing the boss's secretary PC

365
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,639
and then he had to change some ink
cartridges and all that

366
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,730
eighty percent of revenue came from
Billy but they had this big oracle

367
00:28:38,730 --> 00:29:00,059
installation that took a small army to
run but yes sir we haven't really come

368
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:06,030
up with a security baseline yet we work
with a lot of things like a walk and all

369
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,629
that

370
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,470
I couldn't tell you who the developers
are actually talking to for the

371
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,390
professional services posts are too

372
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:18,179
I don't run them off enough people pick
their brain baselines are kind of hard

373
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:23,520
to set because once again depend more on
the business model than then the actual

374
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,660
implementation

375
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,050
I mean no matter how good you are that
don't help if someone has written their

376
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,320
password underneath the keyboard on a
post-it note

377
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,450
so we tend to try to stay away or lease
i do from giving baseline

378
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,530
recommendations it's more like you know
what are good practices what keeps you

379
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,149
safe of our process passes for your
process is documented in well known

380
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,290
I know that

381
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,290
I don't know

382
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,110
well

383
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,760
that thank you for coming out enjoy the
show make sure you think these guys in

384
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,010
the red shirt guys and gals in the red
shirt

385
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,870
they're doing it because they love you
and they're doing for the community

386
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,639
they're not doing it for the applause
although this bumper handshake would

387
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,440
probably help them out

388
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,100
other that thank you very much of any
questions be sure to pick me

389
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,090
and thank you all for coming out
