6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,230

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:41,850
the objective here today is not that I
you for your pet odor or would like to

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,750
learn to build in mind that approach to
things like that

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,570
maybe take back your analyst for your
belt in your organization that's what

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,010
we're talking about here today

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,190
ok i am always open for questions

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,229
I just have to try to raise your hand
and I'll try to all right hand with the

13
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,179
best possible try to fold our question
of the energy making it look like i'm on

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,689
we will try to get you everything then
answer questions at the end of part

15
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,798
so a little bit about the story

16
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,490
um i was working at a thought that a
company had a lot of friends there and

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,500
choir to me

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,079
starting work there of course i would be
to knowledge of NBA that let me have an

19
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,520
organization of life and what's right is
right

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,130
probably here for infrastructure
services i provide an intercept course

21
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,840
ok you know there's always some bad guy
out there that doesn't like the fact

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,950
that an organization

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,470
he doesn't like is using your your
company services right you most your web

24
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,479
there were right you provide the
infrastructure we don't like you

25
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,260
whatever so we're going to that

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,480
kind of a little motivation so when i
was working at they have the same

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,260
problem with anybody else and you have a
bad guy that had been doing some pretty

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,640
awful things that and then what I and I
took a personal

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,690
I mean he made a personal actually let
you don't attack me and my friends and

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,510
my family and my job with my family
right

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,470
and my organization with my livelihood
right so i think the personal to agree

32
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:33,430
and we got off my back cool if like your
dog shit lift and step to be you right

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,750
so I left them that I ended up going to
dallas to do dedicated full time threat

34
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,040
hunting and research and sharing about
the threat something that we do and and

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,910
so now as my full-time job not just
things stock analysts and yelling with

36
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,060
incident but a full-time job getting
some bad guys in backing the internet so

37
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,550
when I left my other company i couldn't
take it in my research we could take any

38
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,750
of my data i mean i had gigs and gigs of
data and research that I had done

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,050
they're all I can take with me what was
trapped between my two years so I've got

40
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,860
talent

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,450
did you know i'm pretty sure that bad
guys been doing bad things while that

42
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,980
isn't haunted by himself

43
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,560
i'm sure you probably fuck that thing on
earth cisco customers bosses it okay if

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,739
I see if i can go find this guy doing
bad stuff to people like back and he

45
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,459
said don't do with any of the data you
know I was like I don't even have copies

46
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,940
of it i just i know i can find them he
has habits

47
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,459
PS patterns he had behavior I have come
to know more difficult for me

48
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,530
and so one of the things that started
with was on a domain

49
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,030
ok just fucking stuck in my head so I
way tonight

50
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,570
i called up this domain and I said you
know I know we use this domain that you

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,829
backing up wonderfully different that
this is going to do bad things better

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,900
sure not here uses them and do bad
things against other people look all

53
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,420
over parts of lemon tree and I was like
okay so where I found it wasn't fishing

54
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,340
he uses domains in a phishing email now
look

55
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,680
suck it Wonder officially now and it
really depended me because it was

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,699
targeting women

57
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:27,960
I was like the audience for the fish was
specifically one picture face

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,310
that's not all it's a great time I look
into this

59
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,080
so let me start to look at now that I
found his domain in this fishing an

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,090
email when I started looking to see what
other phishing emails there were related

61
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,869
to that and then I just said oh my god
that first off I didn't realize that

62
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,190
this whole action out there and practice
over the world email you can imagine the

63
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,530
volume data that had available to me now

64
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,638
first when i worked at a small company
all I saw was our evil right so now I'm

65
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:06,479
seeing tons of the people's email and I
started seeing like wow he's not out

66
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,620
there doing this by himself he's
actually part of the bigger picture

67
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:19,289
because i had to sing email was being
sent with different things

68
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:27,900
now I went in looking for one great
right when I step back and realize that

69
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,340
it wasn't i found the great but I have
also found the entire wine that had all

70
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,299
of the great

71
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,539
so this same email was being used to
fish women still but there were a bunch

72
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,190
of other domains in it so I said well
who owns these domains

73
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,550
well he had jack and John and bill and
bob everything will

74
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,870
how did Jack and john and billy bob all
happens then to say me know from four

75
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:07,440
different countries like okay cool so I
said started documenting rose at that

76
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,950
started with the ones we have a campaign
had 31 email

77
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,000
what you're seeing here is just seeing
my mouth to go diagram is that you had

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,669
to grow little by little I started
looking at different aspects

79
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,010
oh he attacks one spam campaign

80
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,130
thirty-one-year-old I went looking for
one filming there i ended up being sick

81
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,180
too

82
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:44,130
I kept going and domain kept rolling to
the main maybe add right

83
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:53,130
I started with one guy and you're off on
your brother and I was like okay we'll

84
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,360
wait a minute there's a lot of
cooperation going on here

85
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,090
and so I actually decided it's time for
me to just now that i've done my cursory

86
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,960
search

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,609
I need to develop a plan and I need to
start following you know an actual

88
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,190
investigating a possible and that's what
i'm here to share with you guys about it

89
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:24,330
the pot and change the answers you get a
walk go

90
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:33,359
yeah so first we start with what you
want to know what I hate

91
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:47,729
I you know what the bad guy i know that
you know that right

92
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:54,090
and then I'm going to know how big with
my threat I had 25 it so i had to define

93
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:02,099
what was bad food and I got my trusted
resource in this case was the Tama tree

94
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,900
that we had my company outright
sometimes truck source might be open

95
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,590
court virus hole is a great open source
trusted right

96
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,820
open ya trust me

97
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:23,920
you're right Wow degree right so I pride
in my organization i will show you are

98
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,690
right

99
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:32,530
start your own data and then I started
to ask questions are putting it together

100
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:40,750
ok well i went and looking for 1i one
email right that began with fans

101
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,260
I think okay but what's important and
what's relevant

102
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,690
how are they related I identify the
relationship that almost the same line

103
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,160
for all fishing

104
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,459
great the bad guys are smart enough
Bobby Jon to the second word

105
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:07,930
the one day had work and they need to
put an exclamation point Tom he can hear

106
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,849
you haven't felt the same word that was
almost the exact line

107
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:23,170
let me try to go over there they go to
HR and so by trying to help people who

108
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,520
are all don't want to be bold grow hair
and I didn't like that

109
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:35,380
how to roll back later h AI r and I go
for one like that okay with you well

110
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,880
their relationship to the one with the
eighth

111
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:47,260
are you cheatng well my Lords long

112
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,070
what might that line

113
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,530
how should i knew i had to get people it
was marketed it

114
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,990
I read our people - my I'm it don't
happen

115
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:13,210
yes I back w got plus give me everything
right so anyway I had an analysis right

116
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,890
well the problem is that we going
everything in an answer to a question

117
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:29,508
you want a white rat I'm gonna crack the
Moorhead all that fire

118
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,449
how many fire prior appt

119
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:41,540
wait you're fighting fire eating up the
fire of network

120
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,309
you're flying part of the whip you're
right , entire race believe you can get

121
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:57,499
an answer but i will tell you about in
mind talking about ready to tell master

122
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:04,879
key practical on how I'll even after
mouth at all

123
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:15,290
yeah that does not help feeling that
only 13 to get in

124
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,709
ok so after a little bit of aggregation
and lightning

125
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:29,299
I want to create them get to design
profession but what what really happened

126
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:37,579
that I go adding analyzing I hope and I
have to go back to my so what does not

127
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:40,579
represent it on the fly in this cycle
here

128
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:52,220
this is a process after you research
your over every Google answer

129
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,329
I caused you but you didn't get more
answers and working

130
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,799
ok

131
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,720
you don't want to avoid all the ocean I
can sometimes you have to start the

132
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,860
ocean before you can start right fish
right know everything yet you get a

133
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,649
bunch of data that

134
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,649
no fish crap

135
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,589
let you don't want lot that means you go
get it or whatever

136
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:30,279
I have left start trying to hold on the
country

137
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:36,309
oh that's no you don't know

138
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:46,599
hey you know what you have to do you get
your hands back and second and

139
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:58,720
third-order that question so you get to
the point you out watching okay after

140
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,959
you think you should call your network

141
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,969
whatever we met her on your network

142
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:21,459
we actually look at all that you get
your laptop for the tubing of pressure

143
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:29,170
whatever and you're developing at the
end of the day you need to be at your

144
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,990
well what about watch me cheat

145
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:40,179
I did all of it today what do I know
what you want to do not know and what

146
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:53,589
you want to achieve all that but I don't

183
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:56,639
they only name that I be shared or I was
trying to get metric metadata about my

184
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,870
name right

185
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:05,729
so then I decided to take a look at it I
asked me back for collecting the data .

186
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,610
but I have a right to work on

187
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,389
if they ask your question and then when
they get fucking out

188
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,900
you have a roof committed Oh what about
this

189
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,679
look out about anybody

190
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:35,580
probably a little or none of the main
school building and registering you'll

191
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:47,159
know that you're a lot but actually what
I tried in the more I look at it in

192
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,580
another pot anymore so I went and
grabbed the data about that you got out

193
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,070
of was highlighted in yellow right

194
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:08,678
what's unique about the yellow and red
ones and relationship right now and I go

195
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,019
44 right

196
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:21,009
what is this you know why what's
important about 40 and 42 person they're

197
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:34,840
small they're small in a relationship
now breeding with one for the job right

198
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,840
it's larger than I am right

199
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:48,129
yeah I'm all right I what an animal
perspective I want her

200
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:56,469
all right can you imagine my trying to
analyze 23 ID a girl friend

201
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,590
what's hard wood turns and complications
and a concentration when I've already

202
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:09,820
had been there six divided into the
warmer

203
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,980
you're right

204
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,230
so what you are about to meet you find
that

205
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,450

206
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:35,129
we're meeting today we want to look at
right now it just actually let me more

207
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,080
questions for all you

208
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:49,110
retail be her special training every
part of the country are small numbers i

209
00:21:49,110 --> 00:22:03,000
have a small number of actual data where
else to go back at it so I did that for

210
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:16,290
my final look at the three questions so
I asked okay that this theta my other

211
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:24,720
question was why he'll be right i
guarded with my question is why why why

212
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,650
do so i can look at you look at you

213
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,000
sorry hey narrow it down

214
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,840
he steal means that i thought it looked
like a child because i had got a cursory

215
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:50,129
analysis of mine and email right now and
even want to either a I thought had

216
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,470
getting Valerie like you're getting
fatter is really up there if you're

217
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,340
sending somebody to . that you reduce
bag

218
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,500

homework

219
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,910

220
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:19,110
I hey you know that made

221
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:27,330
so that when I want when I what I was
told that he community contacts in my

222
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:37,620
other . so effing analyze everything is
great you don't work you need to share

223
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,149
with you if you're working on

224
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,150
you never have to deal with relevant
information

225
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:51,960
wall street oh I had enough

226
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,860
you need to come together and we want to
meet me so I and normal little bit of

227
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,919
structure on the right

228
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:15,300
yeah we were at and we have a happy
where i'm going to have it is finally

229
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,700
putting the team of the great do when we
find it interesting that we will make a

230
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,320
ticket but we're going to look into this

231
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,530
are we going to get hurt and sometimes i
have a doing this as I w people and

232
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:37,080
things i found other stopped to eat and
get it i wouldn't use that contract that

233
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,770
only you

234
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,809
what why didn't he registered with that
IP what is he doing that name is cool i

235
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:54,340
wonder it or maybe that's another cold
out phishing email had and we do that

236
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,399
all the time and we've never answer to
the previous question what we're finding

237
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,510
all this other cool stuff to go look at
anything needs to be looked at

238
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,129
but not all of it needs to be looked at
now so i'll make a ticket for something

239
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,929
or in other teams

240
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:12,580
I used to like literally give my team
color light on the sticky notes and i

241
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,110
have i'm going to look at the later wall
and we decorated a whole wall sticky

242
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,330
notes and when times were low we go grab
us to eat and find something to dig in

243
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,020
right

244
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,299
sometimes you have to do that but back
to the topic at hand and ask i define

245
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,960
what was bad i decided the criteria that
I was going to use to narrow down my

246
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,039
data set

247
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,760
I narrow it down my second question I
wanted to answer was

248
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,799
why these ceilings why would i look at
it still needs and then I went and

249
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,668
looked ready

250
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,590
he's been charged up here for a variety
of criteria that did that some of them

251
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,899
or ones that i have used previously

252
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:54,668
others were there because of reputation
be almost all of them were there because

253
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:59,500
they offered one or more of the TLD
previously backed up with one of my

254
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:06,100
requirements units group pics you have
to belly

255
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,918
one more so hot quick

256
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,399
why did they choose a higher pitch

257
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:25,330
how many do you think would because the
lateral we're actually don't care

258
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,270
quality

259
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,020
how do you think it's a bad pic yes

260
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,170
how many of you guys pick them think on
the term surf and guarantees that they

261
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,370
got in a class back

262
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:52,739
how do you think that's bad i think i'm
sure they're popular service but what of

263
00:26:52,740 --> 00:27:00,510
business reputation reputation . gonna
wait doesn't that guy there are really

264
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,820
good person to go register at good guy
bad guy never will come over here and

265
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,080
mr. right

266
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,210
so there's reputation on both sides of
the fence where the action is

267
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:25,020
that's why they added I come to that
conclusion

268
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:40,709
I looking at what the price of he'll be
four and the volume of a bit better

269
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:48,990
your belly in right so all right for
either one of them with the domain of 49

270
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:56,850
less four of them were selling my pics
of them were selling them between a

271
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:06,480
dollar dollar fifty for the other nine
the bad guy and who fishing and i'm

272
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:15,090
going to run fishing campaign how fat
you got it pretty quickly rate

273
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:21,449
so if i wanna on a lo how a lot of that

274
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,990
tight in my arms right

275
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:34,800
i buy a lot of time sheet and this is
why we call this off

276
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,090
well we're magnet what i have done this

277
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:49,590
I was actually able to have actionable
intelligence seeing now have the data to

278
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:55,470
prove my theory which was window means
go on this house all the bad guys

279
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,990
migrated to that register and people
thought I was crazy like you know their

280
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,130
children but we started noticing one yet

281
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:13,950
she is going on with the TLB wait . have
taken away a member when it went just

282
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,570
off the chart

283
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,830
all that top that top 40 that's a record
low

284
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,850
that's healed up for fat guys forever
work

285
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,149
we're going to be using that means to
redirect

286
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,320
ok so we have an actual piece of
involvement

287
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,439
so now IM 28

288
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,010
where the bad guy might be one

289
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,840
I become aware that this rental car
companies fail

290
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,780
alright so i can start looking for
incoming their IP face or increase in

291
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:58,800
traffic coming from their IP face right
now but it start knowing I had a hunch I

292
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:05,159
have to figure out how to sew up

293
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,720
I don't want to know we do I have it I
have you guys

294
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,940
I'm going to get a constitution that I

this business and none of these and eat

357
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:17,190
and that only all 15 different
explanation for why love

358
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:27,328
I looked at each other and not look you
get my not saying it like that

359
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:35,490
the resume before we talk about the tool
you can go out and they take your time

360
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,859
out your captures your everything out
the route or board and getting the whole

361
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,859
century and so

362
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,740
you can go out and you say why can't we
eat tuna

363
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:56,259

364
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,790
of you

365
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:06,130

ventures and I this by the way I look

366
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:16,359
now or influence there's nothing there
but there's not enough time after that

367
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:25,598
so I took a look at the matter

368
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:35,650
you know what let's go look at emails
coming in this car riding and I thought

369
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,780
it was the one-man campaign money

370
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:47,500
well you know me and I'll register and I
think ok and let's do it again

371
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,559
go get a URL this man was research
domain

that actor

373
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:02,919

375
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,270

can't apply only one you've got right

377
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,140

everything that I've done here the
problem is me and my organization

405
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:20,029
ok so I kept looking you doing that with
people pop over and over and over and

412
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:16,190
what I already built a little bit as
each morning I you know all I can move

413
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,940

I didn't know it when I started I didn't

425
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:41,130
load look I don't know one guy had been
happening some people i had no I hit

426
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:51,359
that right edges start to ask questions
you're going to get more question great

427
00:45:51,359 --> 00:46:00,660
so I that different questions may be
bigger than what I was one guy and

428
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:09,930
targeting certain party woman with
particular Russia and then over an

429
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,310
entire organization

430
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:23,130
