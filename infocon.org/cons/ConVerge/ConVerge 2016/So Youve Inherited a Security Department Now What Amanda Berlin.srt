1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:35,969
burn it is what it is and yes great and
I really that that says i click for

2
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:48,300
anything wrong

3
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,700
we should wait to classical a friend you
speak but thank you

4
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:15,070
I'm so like you said my name is Amanda
Berlin I'm an architect and this talk is

5
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,460
based around kind of what the book is
about it is the best practices for

6
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,419
enterprise environments anywhere from a
small environment for a larger

7
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,620
environment all

8
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,940
normal stuff that you should do once you
either start a security program or

9
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,979
sometimes you're just thrown into the
Lions then and expected to run a

10
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,979
security department and this is kind of
where to start

11
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,520
that works for me

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:55,300
my head what may be a lot of spunk
integration and implementation and sock

13
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,399
sock managed services

14
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,490
my role specifically is working around
implementations of spunk and giving our

15
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,420
customers the best implementation that
they can have for their individual

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,880
environment

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:18,190
I've done a lot of the . my well this
year's on an IT

18
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,500
I started as just a lowly helped us
person worked up to a lot of network

19
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:32,470
security lot of Windows Server you name
it for exact of all paid whether google

20
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,910
places that I worked running around
putting out fires all the time in really

21
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:44,500
shitty environments and this is where a
lot of that experience came from and

22
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,549
that's the bunker

23
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,420
so because of security published the
Riley

24
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,200
if you ever decide to write a book I
highly recommend going through them

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,208
they're amazing to work with

26
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,410
I've a couple friends that have written
books or other publishers that are

27
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,440
I guess a nightmare

28
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,370
information or anything with relatively
new for them here in rapid like blogging

29
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,770
the writing or screencast or whatever
they're looking for people to it right

30
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,790
now the person and roll and a woman who
is on safari books online

31
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,279
it's still in progress if you get it if
you get it now or if you look at it now

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,270
there are there's a there's a link to
some feedback

33
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,710
so if you have feedback on the first
couple chapters you can go do that

34
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,420
try to be constructive and not a jerk
but it's it's a lot of work writing a

35
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,540
book I didn't realize I people told me
it was a lot of work but I didn't

36
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,179
realize until you start doing it how
much work it is

37
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:58,150
30 so that being said not just gonna
start this out

38
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,850
we want to go into your security deposit
Department program with the idea that

39
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,209
all the low-hanging fruit that's out
there is is what's going to be attacked

40
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,330
for the script kiddies out on the
internet and thoughts whatever

41
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,030
it's automatically going to look for VNC
open to the internet on a server or

42
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,329
windows XP sitting on the internet that
kind of stuff

43
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:29,109
so one of you look that's the person
over and i'll go and read it to you

44
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,190
x on internet and network systems have
no particular target the attacker simply

45
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,540
sends a large broadcast that uses any
pretty unproductive system as a staging

46
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,810
point for it to from which to log launch
an attack like pots using computers

47
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,770
without basic protections like firewalls
and antivirus and user education not

48
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,669
only affects your own business but many
other businesses as the virus is spread

49
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,909
around the internet your systems lack of
protection makes you a target

50
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:01,869
it can destroy your computer or your
network and can contribute to a virus

51
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,710
distribution that slows our halls
portions of the internet you don't want

52
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,119
to contribute to the overall shooting
this is the internet that's not in the

53
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:15,249
quote all of the folks who use the
internet a responsibility to help create

54
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:19,360
a culture of security that will enhance
consumer and business confidence but

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,360
most importantly failing to heed the
best practice advice could hurt your

56
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:30,849
company significantly and this from the
internet scam that one you want to work

57
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:37,449
with your stakeholders whether you have
a security department or not they should

58
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,779
know where use that what your plan is

59
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:47,439
you should work with them to create a
plan doesn't matter what you have a

60
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,439
bunch of red tape to go through are not
having c-level executives or whoever the

61
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,209
stakeholder for the for the data is that
they are going to be people here and

62
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,599
they need to work with and let them know
what is at stake

63
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,619
a lot of wrinkles will go pro

64
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:12,129
it's free you have to let them know that
up front you can do your due diligence

65
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,009
for free without asking them for any
money upfront

66
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,860
a lot of times when you come to them and
say oh my god we have a lot of security

67
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,969
problems we know this we will show you
the research and we can do it all for

68
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:24,279
free at least in the beginning

69
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:32,349
so being able to that path of where you
want to go from free and easy to free

70
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:37,329
and not really easy and then finally
then giving you some kind of budget if

71
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:38,709
you don't have one already

72
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:47,079
a lot of people have budget already a
little more have no the huge blinky

73
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,099
boxes that they're not doing anything
with that they're installed in the form

74
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,180
of a fine

75
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
going hero

76
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:09,750
I don't know what your biggest risk is
so if you are

77
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:16,380
alpert healthcare organization it's
going to be patient safety and then you

78
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,729
kind of flow from there and see what
could cut what could compromise your

79
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:26,130
patient safety and and what controls
what monitoring can you build around

80
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,400
that that you don't have a place already

81
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,198
and then go from there yeah but you know
build a couple of risk of risks out the

82
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,550
use cases around those risks and you
that your starting point in your guide

83
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,530
to where you want to go down the road

84
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,739
great yeah 3 5 10 year plans

85
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,389
I know technology changes a whole lot
but from your business model your risks

86
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,740
are gonna are gonna tame you but not the
one with the technology will around it

87
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:06,599
so grab that management is a recurring
theme throughout all of everything

88
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,510
defense and asset management there's so
many people that have absolutely no idea

89
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,849
what network

90
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:20,280
you know you wanna hear you run a scan
their you're you're looking at dns your

91
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,539
IP address management

92
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:27,150
you're looking at the security scans she
didn't and map you do whatever and still

93
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,610
like three weeks down the line oh my god
there's another one of the key box like

94
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,640
the framework

95
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,819
this came from I'm not going to go too
but the one of the most important thing

96
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
is not be able to hear what

97
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,730
having one source of a lot of people
have like we kind of have a spreadsheet

98
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:02,280
or we have a sharepoint doc or we have
things in dns but it's not it's not all

99
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,030
correct

100
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,220
you're never going to get hundreds
attended like network for being able to

101
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,150
get a pope

102
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,740
you got five on your ability and your
network is going to take the mass

103
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,970
movement being able to automate it
having to do that manually through

104
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,520
spreadsheets I've done that before it's
not very fun and don't forget the cloud

105
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,490
people you know you have your website
out on on the cloud somewhere doesn't

106
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,250
mean that you should not be here it is

107
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,160
it's not you're not always going to your
cloud providers job and it's free and

108
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
easy that you can start with driving me
insane

109
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,880
hello I'm get here

110
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,080
unfortunately the other media grows up
so we have no audio till about the

111
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
12-minute second mark

112
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
so I think

113
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,460
Billy scanner all

114
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,590
anything you can get things like messes
or qualis next pose but things like that

115
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,470
that will at least give you so many
hosts that you would be able to scan and

116
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,800
take to your c-level executive and say
all right

117
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,130
this is all bad we got this from a free
tool this tool you can also pay for

118
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,130
later on down the road but we can pick
all this right now

119
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,209
I

120
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,628
huge microsoft nerd for a while

121
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:55,079
I did a lot with your policy objects and
I'm really super picky and anal about

122
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:01,019
everything being right but i would like
strip apart all the group policy objects

123
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,220
from there's like 50 of them put them
all out on paper and you don't do a gift

124
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,399
manually the pain of all that was a
gigantic pain i don't i don't recommend

125
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,569
doing huh

126
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:19,019
places like mist and there's other words
like out there that have a already

127
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:24,990
hardened best practice group policy
object for servers for windows XP or

128
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,300
windows seven four tet whatever like
whatever OS that you have they already

129
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,248
have a CPL out there that you can
download and just magically import and

130
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:38,249
boom you don't have to worry about doing
all your individual settings

131
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:47,939
they have it all done for you and leave
us out what all configure this view as

132
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:48,899
possible

133
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,299
domain admins every almost every place
that I walked into the window shop that

134
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,439
had the whole IT departments domain
admin

135
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:07,199
that's very very powerful account that
you can screw up a lot with we actually

136
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,679
had a contractor be given domain admin
access and turn one of our application

137
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,879
servers into the main controller which I
mean that's it didn't break anything but

138
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,329
it

139
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:26,969
that's not good to have somebody that's
in India that you don't know their name

140
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,749
have access to be able to do whatever
they want to your your entire domain

141
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:39,209
being a you want to you want to take
those accounts have maybe one or two and

142
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,959
only use that one necessary and instead
of giving everybody don't deny that

143
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,760
admin access like hey

144
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,460
I have a new server and to get my
application to work that happens

145
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,760
holidays of the main admin crack on that
shit

146
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,230
thank you want to know exactly what that
applications doing what its permission

147
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,200
levels need to be given its own account

148
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,000
it's very time intensive but in the long
run it's going to save you a lot of time

149
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,190
because if something happens where you
have to change that domain and password

150
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,380
which you should often but I also been
in places where they haven't changed it

151
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,950
in 10 years and it's you know a poor
character password that anybody could

152
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:26,070
guess getting rid of open shares so I
you don't have to like try to remember

153
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,390
this

154
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,600
I have a knot these updated slides yet
but after this i can just finish editing

155
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,410
me

156
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,969
I i'll put it up on the fly shared on
that so i'll give you all the

157
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,690
information of the end this script will
actually scan your network and tell you

158
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,430
all the open sure you have what you
shouldn't have any unless you want to

159
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,319
use that open chair as kind of like a
honey pot share that you always keep

160
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,750
track Oh push it could be good around
somewhere

161
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,010
also keep cracking it open share
anything to try to accessing it or

162
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,210
writing to it

163
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:05,340
you want to learn on but that should be
open only open care that you have

164
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,510
I know there's legacy shit that comes
into play but for the most part that

165
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:17,340
should be in this able to tell that a
lot of legacy devices still have all

166
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,310
that enabled trying to get that off your
network and a getting old is going women

167
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,189
getting old you know

168
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,860
large IBM boxes or whatever that that's
all they can do this helmet for trying

169
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,620
to move move past that isn't always for
you but you can if you can't get rid of

170
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,660
prominent you can only support alert on
it

171
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:50,370
lockdown logins or HTTPS lot of people
have open HTTP logins everywhere

172
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,780
so you should such a GPS that's one I
did dumb

173
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:01,349
so it's for frontier communications one
of the probably one of the most

174
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,870
embarrassing thing that I ever not have
ever done was last year at Def Con I was

175
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,770
a part of the SecDef sort of engineering
village

176
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,260
so what they do is they give every year
you feel like apply and they give you a

177
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,949
company you have to do a whole bunch of
ocean on them you have like a list of 30

178
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,449
questions that you have to answer or
like you know what do they use your

179
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,800
trash service or what are they using the
VPN address second stuff all over the

180
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,600
list but when you get to the conference
they put you on this glass box at all

181
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,189
soundproof up on stage and you have to
call the company and try also get more .

182
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,520
i bombed like it was the worst
experience ever

183
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,280
thank God they don't record it because i
was i was just a rack afterwards I was

184
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,740
all they ever do that again i hope i've
learned that day that I really don't

185
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,300
like fishing over the phone

186
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,960
it's just not fun at all some people
really good at it but not me

187
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,310
but that was my company and I found that
they had a whole lot of stuff that you

188
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:06,000
can log into / HTS so this is correct
I've device not sprinkling passwords

189
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,650
know an Excel spreadsheet that password
protected

190
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,710
field and fountain get a password
management whether it is something free

191
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,990
that you can use that you can do share
back and forth or if it's a something

192
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,020
like LastPass that the paid service but
has a whole lot of bells and whistles

193
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,000
start free if you want you don't
necessarily have to have a super

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,370
expensive password manager that gives
you all of all the options right away

195
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,310
but don't start throwing them in plain
text especially like even in scripts

196
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,310
that kind of stuff

197
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,360
No

198
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,830
Wi-Fi I was also a place that had open
Wi-Fi

199
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,419
I work to help that some old lady called
she's like my wife is not working and at

200
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,940
that point we were supposed to go like
helping customers and their Wi-Fi wasn't

201
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,780
working

202
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,230
like all right well what rumor un like
oh I'm on so on so sweet

203
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:12,669
are all right so she was just living
down the street using our Wi-Fi and she

204
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:19,809
thought that she would call my paladin
working that that network had just so

205
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:25,240
many problems with that and that was
that was one of the major ones you can

206
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,590
no shot ports that are unused so that
way nobody can walk up plug in their

207
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,399
laptop to this port over here and
automatically get on your inside that

208
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,390
work a lot of places that

209
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,740
and nobody's gonna ask you're just going
to go set up with your laptop next to an

210
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,860
outlet they think you like you're
charging or whatever but no you can just

211
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,020
plug in the cat5 cable and get on our
network setting up port security will do

212
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,220
the same thing but if there were the
terminal here already so say you know

213
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,630
it's some front Secretary's desk or
whatever you can unplug her then plug

214
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,320
right in

215
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,490
it'll automatically no shot that work
done if its season on a mac address

216
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,549
disable ssl all

217
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:14,770
so when thirty-three percent of all
https servers are vulnerable one of

218
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:23,168
these attacks on the internet that

219
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,668
a blink we'll let you catch your website
for a throwable and the second link will

220
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:41,630
actually show you how to switch from SL
to peel us setting up central login

221
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,820
you don't want everybody to be sharing a
log in all your crutches because you

222
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,770
know as soon as i'm gonna get pissed off
of me you don't want to have to just

223
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,070
have you don't worry about them is
available in our account

224
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,350
you don't have to switch all the
passwords setting up in that locker or

225
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:06,860
any other kind of encryption feet
software on end devices especially if

226
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,100
you working somewhere that requires
working somewhere that require that you

227
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,559
don't want to have to come out to the
media and say we lock the device with

228
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:21,980
50,000 have a records on this will
prevent you if you can if you can prove

229
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,970
that that drive with encrypted network
device configuration backups is just

230
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,419
kind of a no-brainer something guys
something you get compromised you're

231
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,190
going to be able to go back and and see
it def between what was working what's

232
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:48,169
not or what you want the dog to do or
what was catching your linux boxes so

233
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:54,049
many people forget about that and
regenerating ssh keys from the balls

234
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,889
this one is an easy stuff to do

235
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,270
it's not necessarily a huge
vulnerability as you that the attacker

236
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,250
have to have the ability to access that
that traffic anyways to be able to

237
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,419
exploit something like this but
rejecting those he is is definitely good

238
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:12,169
stuff

239
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,100
one thing that you can do on showed into
is copy and paste like a public as such

240
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,168
public SSH key and it will show you all
the devices that have not region that he

241
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:26,840
a lot of ISPs do that that ship out
modems or whatever like crazy and all

242
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,730
have the same sht am I

243
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,130
I need software three billion devices
run Java but two million 999999 which

244
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,080
they hadn't java is a huge exploit if
you don't need it for any piece of

245
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
software on your end devices get rid of
it

246
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,660
lock it somehow whatever update it if
you need if you actually do need it

247
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:59,590
another thing is you Bob adobe acrobat
and in like third party apps that aren't

248
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,730
really covered by automatically like
windows updates or whatever their

249
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,200
software packages out there that will
allow you to push on pace to that kind

250
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:17,320
of stuff also black browsing from
servers a lot of my work in the stock we

251
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,169
got a lot of alerts saying you know this
server tried to access this threat

252
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,770
lifted website address their actor and
activist from the main controller over

253
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,280
all that idea that access the internet
from anything with critical information

254
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,160
on it

255
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,030
logging successful logins and alerting
on like correlation searches that you

256
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,379
can do with not successfully moans it's
a log ins so if you see several

257
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,160
unsuccessful logins followed by
successful for a large amount of

258
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,490
unsuccessful apologize that this woman
many successful

259
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,860
you know people using that possible
using an account for malicious activity

260
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:09,459
ah isla settings so if your servers have
an eye low card of the item for

261
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,570
something like that

262
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,820
thank you integrate like that I
interface and again lights out

263
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,939
so you can allow all the silos come with
default user names and passwords that

264
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,900
are out there there's Metasploit module
that will scan your network and tell you

265
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,520
you know how many dell servers you have
with the default password that you can

266
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,960
just log in with I default password and
boom you have access to the top you have

267
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,560
physical

268
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,200
I mean you have access to the physical
properties server but you would also

269
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,400
have access

270
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,370
depending on the family log-in or logout
or not

271
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:50,739
- that entire server so those those sons
are extremely important and dns service

272
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,640
and DC's should not have any other types
of software on them

273
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,760
we had a going back to that that the
public Wi-Fi

274
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,200
he had a our network to begin with

275
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,040
so this is all fix took a while let me
fix now our network had a are

276
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,770
public-facing web site was doing home so
it had access to the internet and access

277
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:20,200
to be in in turn on the internet on this
from the same server so you could go to

278
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,250
the server from the internet and the
back and sequel database that populated

279
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,070
our website was on the domain controller
so you can go right from the internet

280
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,689
through the website to the main
controller which also served up Wi-Fi in

281
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:43,090
public life I address the Wi-Fi . so you
can kind of go full circle

282
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:48,580
you could come in through website go to
the DC and then go back out to the

283
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,949
public Wi-Fi or the other way around

284
00:25:50,950 --> 00:26:00,429
turning off DNS zone transfers gives a
little bit lot less information to

285
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:08,230
potential packers turning off open
recursive DNS prevent in the ass

286
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:14,470
whooping open they'll realize you don't
want anybody anywhere to be able to send

287
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:20,920
out of your mail server part of this a
lot with exchange servers that are on

288
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,080
the internet they just leave it all the
default settings and everybody is able

289
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,309
to connect this open mail relay ins and
out information where they want

290
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:35,230
there's websites I there's a list on
websites on the internet that will show

291
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:40,360
you all the current open mail relays
that are on the internet you can send

292
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
mail as anybody to anybody

293
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,110
so I think that picture

294
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,570
so can anybody tell me when the
ransomware started changing file names

295
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,580
of encrypting files around three o'clock

296
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,760
hey if you turn on advanced auditing on
your files you're going to be able to

297
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,100
alert on this in a heartbeat

298
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,360
no you're not going to know you're not
going to stop the ransom mark or

299
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,639
whatever devices on unless your super
quick

300
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,210
but you're gonna be able to prevent it
from spreading and be able to look for

301
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,850
indicators of compromise that kind of
stuff should to make it so that ransom

302
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:39,149
or doesn't spread to get any worse that
disco is a free software i absolutely

303
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:45,750
love you can install it will call your
network it will show you what iOS nom

304
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,890
versions you have everywhere it will
tell you what hanging off of what for it

305
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:55,679
will give you the mac address it will
give you are you know what ports are

306
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,530
open on your switches what parts are
just abled it used to be kind of a pain

307
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,899
in the ass to install that I think
they've gotten a little bit better with

308
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,320
it

309
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,750
look the perlier they've gone along
inversions great free software her being

310
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:18,059
able to tell what's actually on your on
your on your network and don't forget

311
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:18,960
your printers

312
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:28,710
did anybody see when we've got a whole
bunch of and I somatic print out all

313
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,290
open printers on the Internet

314
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,970
yeah don't don't forget to secure
printers one of the one of the major

315
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,460
things I hear from like my offensive
friends that admin credentials are

316
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,260
stored on printers everywhere

317
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
one of the easiest things to get

318
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,199
there's some free software that you can
install on windows and linux boxes so

319
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,270
you are all fan will scan incoming
requests your website and kind of figure

320
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,710
out it was a legitimate request on and
we'll lock the ones that don't seem to

321
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,350
be the whole bunch of settings you can
set with that

322
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:15,909
that's where is for Microsoft shooting
mom see here

323
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,450
oh so some of the things like Max URL
and remove them going to try to remember

324
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,400
to remove the server header on failed
the band will scan your log this is for

325
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,290
linux building and will feel of skin
your log piles and automatically add

326
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:36,580
anything that looks suspicious to your
linux firewall

327
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:47,379
oh you're my security is a way that will
do like full full logging for

328
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:56,620
alterations on the necks and it will be
a little provide like a kind of security

329
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,320
assessment of the website that I'm not
happy or whatever it's pretty easy in

330
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,090
sausages of one commanded and and I've
never really had any problems with

331
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,090
defaults on the other ones that I've
been holding on

332
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,190
password management again no you don't
want to start of context and Microsoft

333
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,140
baseline security analyzer should be run
on all your love and windows server for

334
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,450
you what about that now

335
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,640
I did the solar on what happens when you
edit slides right before your dog

336
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:40,240
ah so I our bug out bag just a
compilation of things that you should

337
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,220
have when the shit hit the fan when your
network just gets hosed

338
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,850
or you know you have a attacker inside

339
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:54,609
you want to have this stuff available to
you if you're not able to be about the

340
00:30:54,609 --> 00:31:00,460
internet anymore or if a compromise your
your domain controller and just

341
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,710
completely shut up medication

342
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,100
this kind of stuff will save your ass in
the long run

343
00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:11,498
I don't know that you can really fit in
about the bag but have a room with all

344
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:17,289
the shit in it and probably good and i
added Kathy and snacks on there because

345
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:23,590
I was really I was worried because all
the the bullet my lineup but and I

346
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,678
couldn't think of anything else to add
here so if you have anything else that

347
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,529
might go well with a minor bug out bag
that's great

348
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:36,249
- uh this blue team handbook incident
response edition is where I kind of got

349
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:40,509
the idea for the book that I'm writing
because i wanted something that was more

350
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,960
accomplished than different response but
this is an absolutely wonderful for

351
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,789
instantly upon all of these procedures
steps to go through the instant handlers

352
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:53,230
handbook from sands actually has a man
that you can run on Windows and Linux

353
00:31:53,230 --> 00:32:01,389
and and it has already built play books
that you can use in your environment and

354
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:10,928
just edit it as instead of starting from
the ground up everybody not purple

355
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:18,999
teaming as I want you guys are very
interactive show of hands of who doesn't

356
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,470
know what purple Phineas

357
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,659
hell I want alright so purple timing is
so you have red team and blue team right

358
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:29,679
red payments offensive team is defunct
blue purple team is when you combine the

359
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,039
two and have your defensive team whether
it be your security team or you know

360
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,960
whoever is the technical people in your
department actually doing as much as I

361
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,769
can - 10 pitch from the inside so you
can go

362
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:49,210
you don't have to go a whole year or
however long you have to wait for a pass

363
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,899
to have something legitimately trying to
attack your network and find weaknesses

364
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,109
you have somebody that can consistently
do it without having to pay for you know

365
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:02,290
a couple of large full-scale penned us

366
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:08,230
some of the things that you can do you
think some of these are no no it's not i

367
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,420
think i'm going to probably leaving
later

368
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:19,030
so you write something else that you can
do is use your education something

369
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,610
that's near and dear to my heart is also
a full chapter and book you a lot of

370
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,020
people look down on user education
because interested users whether they

371
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:36,190
know they are your first line of defense
when it comes to you know letting you

372
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,620
know phishing attempt came in their
third

373
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,810
more than likely them calling you and
saying I something something weird

374
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,340
happening

375
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,199
that's going to have worked better than
I think about that you have on your

376
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,230
network because the phishing attempts
are always going to get through

377
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,470
you're not going to be able to work on
them all that person watching their

378
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:04,570
inbox and knowing something looks weird
and contacting you is priceless but they

379
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,399
also have to be able to talk to you
right

380
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,320
you can't just show them to find sale
yeah right you just know how you're

381
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,450
doing that site looks weird

382
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,719
you have to be open and willing to
communicate with them because they

383
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,540
they're going to add to your security

384
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:27,400
not sure how long on there's a script
out there that will go and change all

385
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,320
your local admin password for the same
and do like a like some kind of

386
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,970
iteration right

387
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:40,418
the one time like a long time ago I work
is P we would set like the local admins

388
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:50,980
to be customer three letter code that we
use for them like XY XY and then

389
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:56,590
customer number or you know some number
of the month that way not every local

390
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,210
admin password the same you wouldn't be
able to hop from one box to another with

391
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,210
the same password if you're an attacker

392
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,879
Emily's privilege the least privilege of
the general concept over everything that

393
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,809
you do

394
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:18,289
application whitelisting instead of
application blacklisting it's way easier

395
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:22,609
to know what software is supposed to run
on your environment as opposed to what

396
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:27,078
software isn't supposed to run on your
environment because there's and then

397
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,460
there's no malware coming out

398
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,079
hourly that you wouldn't have to worry
about if you just started to application

399
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,170
whitelisting instead a little bit of a
pain in the ass to you in the beginning

400
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,140
because especially the size of your
depending on the size of your

401
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,160
environment

402
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,649
it's going to be such a large amount of
software like the neighborhood health

403
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,829
care all the time and blogs . cycle back
tail really 400 ish bed hospital and we

404
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:56,690
probably had 300 different applications
over two contenders different apartments

405
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,839
and stuff it's really difficult to be
able to start there in an environment

406
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:09,470
that haven't had it before but it
definitely worked at no longer and then

407
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:15,109
canary in the coal mine and the same
idea as that that open share that you

408
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:19,308
always monitor you can do the same thing
with like a sequel server so the sequel

409
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:20,180
server up

410
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,000
don't leave everything default when
everything else is locked down as hell

411
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,950
because I mean my part smart a factor
for investor is going to realize that

412
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,098
the canary in the coal mine and just
ignore that box

413
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:36,170
just lock it down a little bit ly v1
vulnerability open something like that

414
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,799
and that's the server your server
service that helps that you're going to

415
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:46,430
monitor for an egress building filtering
so everything

416
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,270
outbound on your network should be
filtered as well

417
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,910
most people just fill her in on traffic
so if you feel for inbound traffic but

418
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,328
not outbound you're going to have
something that takes a lot of home get

419
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:03,710
infected and just completely holding
your network from the out from the

420
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,640
inside because now they're doing command
and control stuff where they got the

421
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:14,808
internet and it is a huge cycle locking
the default an eye and then going

422
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:17,640
through and seeing what actually have
open

423
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,788
also something really difficult to do
when you already out have everything

424
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:25,200
open your firewall but something that
needs to be done

425
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:36,630
so this is a little bit more about
purple teaming you don't have to be

426
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,619
amazing

427
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,190
like I knock it off against my god

428
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,849
although all the jobs that i was
searching for jobs

429
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,819
all the ones that i could find more
often since and I just I'm not confident

430
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:51,690
in my skills

431
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,690
I know how to do this stuff though the
stuff is great when you want a purple

432
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,799
theme and you don't have to give a
report to the customer at the end of the

433
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,140
day saying yeah I've tried everything

434
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,359
you just can try the simple stuff in
your network for you by until your next

435
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,500
contraction us

436
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,349
these are some of the things that will
give you give an attacker aunt Esther

437
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:21,390
domain admin right away so not bios and
linked local mostly resolution

438
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:29,098
I think you can spoof really easy with
responder you'll just say hey I'm this

439
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,140
device it will listen for those that
bios queries and answer them because

440
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,609
that's what windows starts out with
before dns you looking for something

441
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,839
it will look for your netbios you can
turn that off relatively easily and your

442
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,700
policy

443
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,629
ah and map and masks in your network

444
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,230
make sure you don't screw it up

445
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:02,339
look like I i did am a scan on the one
place that I work and completely put

446
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:06,210
down our firewall so there are some
firewalls that do not like being courts

447
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:13,710
hand which you would think firewalls
would be ok with this one was not so do

448
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,890
it during downtime communicate

449
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:22,440
you don't get fired despite something
else that is really cool to play with

450
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,450
especially if you do it like a lab first
kind of learned from the tools

451
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:33,579
that medicine . has fake in there is a
lot of pop and stuff that you can do

452
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,779
with the two but there's a really good
but that book out there are five days

453
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:41,109
Kennedy that goes over some really
amazing matters . self

454
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:45,789
rawr is a really cool

455
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:51,640
python script that will search your
network for web pages and will just

456
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,410
display a splash of web pages for you
that it on your network

457
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:02,740
this is used a lot from Tiger pen
testers whatever in Charlie to see what

458
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,160
looks like it might be the best source
of information for the biggest target

459
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,069
you might find what it's like out there
that you didn't know like a default

460
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:12,910
website or something on a server that's
not listed as a web server that you

461
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,890
didn't know that you had and set is the
social engineering tool kit

462
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:23,379
it's it's part of our you can download
them independently your part of cali it

463
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,299
but I did all my fishing internal
fishing campaigns with you can create

464
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:33,940
pretty simply like with options one two
and three

465
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,869
like the list the subject you list the
names of targets and you can

466
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:43,569
automatically just send out email to
them with a link and they will be

467
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:48,279
redirected back to about you running at
prom and you can have your credentials

468
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,450
you can try and get river shells
credential capturing is like one of the

469
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,490
easiest thing ever

470
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,410
and if you really need to get anybody's
attention on white user security is

471
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,399
important

472
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,609
run this in front of them after phishing
attempts

473
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:08,049
especially if you don't have you any
user education had the first time I ran

474
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:08,710
it

475
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:15,069
I got out of out of 300 I got something
like a hundred and fifty username and

476
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:16,180
password back

477
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,200
email was from a gmail address the there
was no attachment it was just a plane to

478
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,910
wine non HTML site that took you to an
IP address and I like Oh with the survey

479
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,390
Shh

480
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,779
give me the domain admin username and
password for their domain username and

481
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:42,880
password and these two links are good so
the first one is the past ten ways that

482
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,220
spider let our pathways by your lab
domain admin includes the net bio stuff

483
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,279
and how to fix that and some others and
some other things too

484
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:58,299
compared to us up fiber kind of the same
thing just different category are you

485
00:41:58,299 --> 00:41:58,900
doing a blush

486
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,730
all right working on something here to
secure compliance

487
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:11,230
I don't know I'm so josh from our pet is
actually running a really cool class

488
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,990
here today or tomorrow

489
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,549
I think on the difference between
security and compliance and why they're

490
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,319
not mutually exclusive

491
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,509
there's a way to do compliance correctly
and there's a way to compliance you can

492
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:30,430
be one of those organizations and this
happens a lot even even in the security

493
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,000
community

494
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,630
we're like all right yep I got this I
got this I got this but they don't do a

495
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,089
deep dive and figure out if you're doing
it correctly

496
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:41,529
sure you have to back authentication but
it's not really implemented correctly so

497
00:42:41,529 --> 00:42:44,950
anybody any at that anyways there's ways
that you can implement to back out the

498
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:50,859
education that don't work right and that
goes her really all of the different

499
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,220
components areas

500
00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:02,709
bless you so for the love of God have a
dmz if you can put it behind a firewall

501
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:10,119
their network segmentation can be that
very difficult to put in place

502
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,640
especially if you don't have a budget
for firewalls

503
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,109
but it's definitely something that very
for the design of your environment

504
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:22,690
because you don't want everything to be
able to be accessed from the internet

505
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:28,809
all the time i see people like already
please open the internet and excited on

506
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:34,210
there and that are or just randomly they
can already be over here and they find

507
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:39,099
you know not number of things that if
it's going to be active from the

508
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,180
internet it should be in the DMV

509
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:48,240
don't put everything in your tea
creating more veal and I'm not having a

510
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,959
flat network makes it more difficult for
our hackers to pivot you go from one to

511
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,500
the next

512
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:02,310
so having all your high priority servers
on one day I am having you know maybe

513
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:09,810
different departments even even have a
char on VLAN you can have you know in

514
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:13,710
our case it was like all the doctors
offices in different on separate your

515
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,260
local area network and to you know you
can put access control in between the

516
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,780
two so it's not an easy to just

517
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,030
can an entire / 8 of your insight
network you have everything that face a

518
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,240
little bit more difficult for you but
way more difficult for them

519
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:37,830
Active Directory delegation rights gets
past the hole

520
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:45,000
everybody has domain admin especially
for your IT team database admin seconds

521
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,680
that might be a little bit more elevated
privileges access control us between the

522
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,410
Williams and this is finally if you have
done all that that the majority of what

523
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,830
everything that we just covered is
completely free all it's gonna take is

524
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:06,000
your time and a lot of great people but
but you there

525
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,950
I mean if all that's wrong with your
network and they don't realize how

526
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,180
messed up it is you're going to make
their life harder by giving you know

527
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,870
making them have more difficult
passwords are making it so they're all

528
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,529
their machines automatically lock the
end users are going to notice when you

529
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,740
become more secure it's going to be more
difficult for them but being able to go

530
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:32,040
with your your c-level executives

531
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,560
so they know and you can communicate
everybody of why you're doing it would

532
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,120
make it a little bit better

533
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,310
so now we're going to go for all the
kinds of stuff to do you have about

534
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,930
it would you should have not even those
miles I'll get a real vulnerability

535
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:56,310
scanner get a sim IDF IPS do some of
that advanced correlations searches

536
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,740
alerting threat list stuff that is out
there that you know you have to pay for

537
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:07,770
subscriptions for that kind of stuff is
going to be a budget line item and i

538
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:14,700
have to say spawn because like you just
you know him out there get a

539
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,509
professional contests at least yearly
and some people do it more often

540
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:23,910
depending on the type of business you're
in your early is great it gives you

541
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:28,200
enough time to try and fix everything
that they found and do a little bit more

542
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,100
on your own

543
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,470
so and makes it more difficult for them
to get it next time don't always use the

544
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,600
same pasture and know what the
difference between a vulnerability

545
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,279
scanning the pen testing is a lot of
places will sell ten past selves our

546
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,360
ability scan as the dentist so they just
hand you an SS report

547
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:53,250
you're not getting any use out of that
they need to be actively trying to

548
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,630
attack you using something other than ok
it is a vulnerability that showing up in

549
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,450
the school

550
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,370
it's it's going to be so worth your love
worth the price to actually have a

551
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:11,009
legitimate one setting up to factor
often doing it correctly

552
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,080
there's a way to there's at least one
company i know that you can set it up

553
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,210
where you have no pin

554
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,900
you have no key fob what it doesn't just
call the number that's in the software

555
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,270
you put in your username and password

556
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,270
they called the call the number and all
i have to do is hit pound

557
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:36,000
we've had people get past that so
quickly because the user just realized

558
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,570
just had seen the number before they
know what to do there already trained

559
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:45,090
and they're going to hit that pound and
what the attacker in because there may

560
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,090
be something in the background logging
in

561
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,328
an advanced coursework devices i'm going
to go through these really quick and I'm

562
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:56,390
also time getting organized

563
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,979
IP address management if you use back
addresses

564
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,569
there's no way everything is going to be
in dns so being able to track those

565
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:10,249
somehow with the ipad and management
faster pace with you talk about doing

566
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:14,899
tabletops actually incident response
drills so say you know this server gets

567
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:16,578
attacked in this way

568
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:22,189
now what walk through it all they're
they're priceless I've done those a

569
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:28,640
couple times on from not my my end with
larger companies actually had one like

570
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,799
last one we want your tabletop and they
got almost the exact attack happened

571
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:39,709
like two week later they completely
screwed up but they were way better off

572
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,359
than they were

573
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:47,119
had they had not if they had not on the
tabletop anything

574
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:53,179
oh this is a really good presentation
about attack driven defense and talk

575
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:59,689
about user education and why they're you
know but the your personal events and

576
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:15,500
cautions 30 seconds left my experience
you

577
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,900
I spoke to them I the most of the work
that I do is surrounding yes which is

578
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,900
underpriced security which is the same
product form

579
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:30,169
I think it works great though the amount
of custom correlation searches that you

580
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,040
can write some of the ones that come out
of the box from small group of us need a

581
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:40,040
lot of tuning but the power that you
have with the logs coming in the way

582
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,060
they come in

583
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,130
you can create you can alert on damn
near anything like correlation searches

584
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,070
on that we have on a lot of hurting
Lands Act

585
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,100

586
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:58,880
first one that will pull a lot of the
different data and anybody else

587
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,410
