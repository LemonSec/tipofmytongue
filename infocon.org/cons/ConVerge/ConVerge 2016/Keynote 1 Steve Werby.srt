1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,219
so I'm glad to be here today thanks for
having me converge on one of the nice

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,730
things about presenting at conferences
you get to make up a title for yourself

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,439
so I made up a new title for myself on
the intergalactic Leah clean strategic

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,310
cyber thought leader so I got all the
buzz words in there that I wanted to get

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,109
in and it's a picture i took on the way
in from the airport so I'm glad to be

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,189
here in Detroit

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,189
home of the giant tire

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,190
this is also from their prize actually
fairly fortunate to get your I almost

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,218
was in a car accident on the way to the
first airport

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,789
almost almost missed my connection so I
had a lot of difficulty fortunately I

11
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,719
got your yesterday this was a lot of
machine and inside the airport in

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,020
Detroit said winning so I'm gonna be
using this for a lot of Marines coming

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,559
up tonight

14
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,370
so one of the reasons i'm really excited
to be here today is what converges about

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,030
this is my first time here at the
convert security conference but if you

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,320
look at the website

17
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,490
it's all about information sharing in
getting people together that our

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,390
information security IT in the business
to do security more effectively and

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,290
learning from one another that got me
really excited because i have a really

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,619
strong passion for sharing information
security and learning from others

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,250
so before I tell you who i am and i do
know who I am I want to little bit more

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,700
about you and I think it's important
that we all get to know each other a

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,090
little bit so I know we all have
something in common

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,259
we're all here - 10 converge we'd all
probably over the last week or so

25
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,659
captured some pokemon or had some
conversations about pokemon if you don't

26
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,979
know what that is

27
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,759
then you pride in hiding under a rock
for the last week

28
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,810
just help curiosity is there anyone here
in this room raise your hand if you're

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,969
not here for converge or you don't know
what pokemon go is one of the two

30
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,179
okay so everybody

31
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,110
so I want to thank the volunteers and
organizers of converge

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,670
I put on some conferences before I
volunteer to conferences it's a lot of

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,260
artwork to get the point where you have
a great opportunity at a conference like

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,820
this that's two days long

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,049
a lot of it will go extremely well and
you won't notice that there may be think

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,840
some things that don't go quite as well
as you'd expect

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,110
it's very difficult to run a conference
so as you see the organizers are

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,690
volunteers over the next couple days

39
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,050
thank them for their time and effort
they really deserve a round of applause

40
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,069
a couple

41
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,640
to do to get to know you better are
wondering who thinks they traveled

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,779
farthest of anyone here to get to
converge anyone

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,519
than 1,500 miles thousand miles

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,800
no one thinks they travel further than
anyone else or just have a bunch of shy

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,500
people forget i traveled from Richmond
Virginia

46
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,660
they won't travel from further than
Richmond Virginia ok

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,510
where'd you travel from san antonio
taxes know it well used to live there

48
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,180
it won't travel from further than San
Antonio there's a lot of people in a

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,600
fairly local one of those of you play
pokemon go

50
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,310
who thinks they're at the highest level
of anyone in the room so much out of the

51
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,549
level you're at want to use at the
highest level

52
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,770
so what's that

53
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,620
money is at that level

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,620
I mean it can anyone top level 20

55
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,470
pretty impressive so I know what you're
gonna be doing for the next couple of

56
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,760
days

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,530
all right one good idea who you are

58
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,620
so who's never been to converge raise
your hand if you've never been

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,209
ok so a lot of first-timers who's never
been to a security conference at all

60
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,840
Wow ok so quite a few of you

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,860
so those of you that are sitting there
somebody that's never been to the

62
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,000
conference

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,608
you might want to give you some tips who
here is not in the information he's not

64
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,209
in information security your IT you
raise your hand if you're not

65
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,550
information is your ite if you want an
audit compliance legal when you want a

66
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,520
student student anyone this is not what
audit compliance or legal custody and

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,260
he's a 1 a few people other people here
that are 90 but not in security

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,549
yeah those of you that are an idea or
are you all practitioners or any of you

69
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,060
I team managers raise your hand up your
IT manager

70
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,650
ok maybe five or so those of your
insecurities how many of you are not

71
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,479
technical practitioners how many of you
are managers or another role but it's

72
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,060
not really considered technical and
raise your hands

73
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,090
so not be made so it seems like mostly
we have security technical practitioners

74
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,888
here we have a fairly good mix of other
people as well so what myself

75
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,539
i'm currently on an enterprise security
architect which is a technical role i

76
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:20,430
served in management roles before so I
thought been on both sides of the table

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,599
also done

78
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,010
blue and red so as a good question I
should ask to hopefully as a blue means

79
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,990
defense red means off a fence

80
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,169
purple means a mix of the two who here
we're concerned themselves purple

81
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,320
so a few that we're seeing more people
moving that direction the field

82
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
what about red teamers you raise your
hands if your regular

83
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,940
ok so most of you are on the defense
side

84
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,300
all right I think that's pretty helpful
to know so now we all have a better idea

85
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,440
of who we are and I have a better idea
which will help give you some context as

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm group presentation

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,830
so in terms of who i am it's actually
not super relevant and first I want to

88
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,609
talk to you about today I'm not really
talking about anything that I'm you're

89
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,930
really demonstrate my credibility for my
experience with so i'm not going to go

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,710
into a lot of details like what degrees
i have work sorts i have all of which

91
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,530
are expired because it's not really
relevant

92
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,729
also I don't you believe very strongly
in certain insert so i'm not one of

93
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,300
those people that feels like somebody
has soared agrees that are more skilled

94
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,990
her experience and somebody else not
saying that starts on a bad thing

95
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,460
I just made the decision not to continue
to get certain not to continue to pay

96
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,539
money to have mine

97
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,640
you be valid so in terms of a few things
about me though they may be a little bit

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,349
interesting

99
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,830
I but your numbers up here for the one
represents the number of companies I've

100
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,300
had to dissolve I Iran and IT
development company during the dot-com

101
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,060
error and one day I had to go in the
dissolved becoming a let everybody go

102
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,300
into writing experience three represents
the number of years it took between the

103
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,740
time that somebody came to my door and
said you've been served

104
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,190
if you've seen law and order it works
just like that somebody rang the door

105
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,540
and said are you Steve worthy i said yes
they handed me a big package that you

106
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,810
can serve it had to do with a role I had
a sassy so for a state agency the case

107
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,900
of which i was a codependent got killed
all the way up to the US Supreme Court

108
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,250
so the three represents a number of
years there was an active court case

109
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,930
where series of a court cases related to
something i did in the due course of my

110
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,260
job then result is that the case was
never actually found successful and so

111
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,150
there was no action was taken against me
but i can tell you being a security

112
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,479
practitioner and having a court case
hanging over your head for three years

113
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,140
is an interesting experience in three
organizations I service etho 11

114
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,128
represents the number of data breaches
that

115
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,949
I was leading the security program for
under which we had perform public

116
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,619
notification to those who were affected

117
00:07:56,619 --> 00:08:00,999
- those were particularly interesting
one of them was interesting because it

118
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:05,139
was believed that all or nearly all of
those that were affected were deceased

119
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,369
and if you look at data breach
notification laws they specifically

120
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,800
relate to notifying citizens

121
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,309
you're no longer a citizen if your
disease that was a pretty hard one to

122
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:20,439
deal with for another one which was
actually a university i worked at I

123
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:26,469
serve as the one person call center so i
had almost a thousand people call me and

124
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,039
i have personally respond to them have
conversations relay the data breach so

125
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:37,750
these are all really fascinating
learning experiences which is part of

126
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,688
what made me who I am today and what the
950 years is not being related to

127
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:44,980
security at all

128
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,189
i use an app called untapped to track
that you need beers that I drink I got

129
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,790
kind of lazy with it but the number of
unique years that I've had

130
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,430
so that's pretty much everything you
need to know about me so in a way this

131
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:02,259
he know is about success and success can
be defined a lot of different ways we're

132
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,800
not really going to explore what your
definition of it is but in general

133
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,109
success is typically thought of as some
level of accomplishment is generally

134
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,490
something you're accomplishing towards a
target so some aim you have for some

135
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,740
purpose is a technology practitioner it
could be looked at very simplistically

136
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,480
as for medium vulnerabilities
identifying threats but from an

137
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,380
organizational perspective those types
of things don't generally matter to an

138
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,279
organization organization is going to be
in the business of providing a service

139
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,470
selling a product having some kind of
offering and security is just one type

140
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,389
of risk that they have to manage

141
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:45,009
so it's important when you think about
what your role is what success is to

142
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,189
understand what the organization
considered a success and what your part

143
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:53,219
in it is and how well aligned they are
my

144
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,509
my in today is actually fairly
simplistic I guess you're a couple of

145
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,649
high-level beans and I'm gonna pose a
set of challenges challenges to you

146
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,040
posing challenges is not very hard i'm
just going to ask you to do something

147
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,300
and I actually going to force you to do
it so it should be pretty easy for me to

148
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,319
achieve my name to give you a couple
examples of techniques so i'm going to

149
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,628
talk about going to talk about things
such as tricking adversaries

150
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:25,139
what I call waiting rooms bait buttons
so many of these are my own terminology

151
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,680
but these are things that I consider
unconventional some of them are things

152
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,439
that some organizations do but they're
not things that you'll commonly your

153
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:35,819
belt which is why I want to expose you
to them today in terms of unconventional

154
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:39,329
approaches i'm talking about things that
are a typical from a conventional

155
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:42,329
perspective from the conventional
perspective

156
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,290
security is historically then
identifying vulnerabilities in doing

157
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,819
something about them

158
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:52,050
identifying incidents and doing
something about those in order to

159
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,579
mitigate potential impacts and then
threats are usually part of the mix as

160
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:02,250
well so it's really about identifying
threats identifying vulnerabilities

161
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,779
putting controls into place to prevent
the vulnerabilities from being its

162
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,100
avoided and then when incidents occur
detecting those incidents as quickly as

163
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,209
possible or in some cases it is often
better for an organization not to know

164
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,410
about an incident so when you think
about success think about whether your

165
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,769
organization is one that actually wants
to know about an incident or want to

166
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,089
know about the vulnerability

167
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,269
it's valid for an organization to
potentially take that approach

168
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,930
ok so

169
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,979
- the unconventional I want to talk a
little bit about conventional and and to

170
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,240
me really this has been many faces of
security I'm really bucketing a couple

171
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,390
of decades and security into one client
conventional sack

172
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,529
this is when we focused on identifying
vulnerabilities in doing something about

173
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,850
them doing something about them could be
patching it could be remediated you're

174
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,000
mitigating of vulnerability be
generating report and saying it to

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,940
somebody and hoping they're going to do
something about it could be just

176
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,610
identifying vulnerabilities in doing
nothing about them because of your

177
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,750
organization

178
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,930
you're not a power to do anything more
than identify the vulnerability and do

179
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,160
nothing about it

180
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
it could be observing that there's
attacks

181
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,569
hopefully you've moved to the point
where your organization is trying to

182
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,010
predict what kind of attacks may occur
and prevent the attacks from occurring

183
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,450
or at least prevent the impacts from
occurring or being significant and then

184
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,450
we have all to trying to identify
incidents and then contain them recover

185
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,520
from them learn from them and improve
our security posture so that was really

186
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,120
initially what conventional security was
and we decided let's start doing

187
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,930
something a little bit more robust and
we decided to focus on basically

188
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,060
restricting things we restricted access
the systems via usernames and

189
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,680
credentials and groups we harden systems
by configuring them a certain way that

190
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,640
made us feel good and we isolated
systems when either none of this was

191
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,589
possible for that was an additional
layer that we decided to approach and

192
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,520
that essentially was the model of the
hard outer core and the soft juicy

193
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,660
middle

194
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,829
we then evolved to learn about things
called death practices now best

195
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,620
practices are something that are not
universal

196
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,920
you may have a different best practice
then you may have

197
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,310
there may be some things we commonly
agree or best practice like it's best

198
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,260
practice to have a strong password

199
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,670
it's not best practice to define what a
strong password is eight characters

200
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,670
upper and lower case a number and
special characters

201
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,839
it's not necessarily a strong password
but it's something that for a long

202
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,500
number of years has really been the
litmus test of what a strong password is

203
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,660
i would say metrics but under
conventional sec i would say really what

204
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,850
we did was statistics we measure stuff
it wasn't necessarily the right things

205
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,020
metrics are supposed to be things that
help you take action

206
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,530
I a metric should help you understand
what's occurring

207
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,120
what the impact is and what you can do
about it knowing how many how many time

208
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,530
somebody's been jiggling doorknob or
throwing stones against her window which

209
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,790
may be a brute force attack or an
attempt to exploit a vulnerability that

210
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,469
you have good remediation and mitigation
for it's not really useful metric so

211
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,730
it's what i would call statistics so
very conventional sec we measure things

212
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,420
and then we decided was probably a good
idea to have a policy so we wrote down

213
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,910
what we expected users to do and what we
expected IT system in this reason to do

214
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,410
and not to do and then we made those
policies available and we hope that it

215
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,430
read them and understood them and then
we found out they did it we did some

216
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,319
training then we moved on to class
buying our guidance systems because we

217
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,030
recognize that not all systems in all
data were equivalent some data was worth

218
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,449
more the organization other data and
some systems were more important in

219
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,800
other systems we didn't necessarily do
anything with these classifications at

220
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,329
least we had classifications in place
then we did what was actually called

221
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,080
risk assessment but really wasn't
necessarily risk assessment it really

222
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,090
was writing wrist down so that we get
hand those documents over to people and

223
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,920
say hey we don't have a way to mitigate
this remediated so we're telling you

224
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,140
about the risk announce your problem
then we started to get really frustrated

225
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,000
use your uncertainty and out to say hey
the sky is falling

226
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,350
this bad thing happened somewhere else
it could happen to us here and that

227
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,190
really didn't resonate with our
stakeholders so we went to third parties

228
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,380
like the big 4 and in other
organizations and we said come in and do

229
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,280
a maturity model against a sauce from
the maturity perspective against other

230
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,660
organizations

231
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,770
tell us are we were doing things that
Hawk and we writing things down here we

232
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,569
have good procedures in place

233
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,760
do we have the right to

234
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,000
listen bitch Marcus against other
organizations and we were able to take

235
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,200
that to our stakeholders and say hey
we're not as good as our peers therefore

236
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,670
bad things are going to happen now what
we didn't tell them is a lot of our

237
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,020
peers were being benchmark against also
we're already having bad things happen

238
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,949
but still it helped us get funding and
helped us get tools we demanded more and

239
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,280
more tools and a few years we always
talk about these MPE full-time

240
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:14,459
equivalents not people we need more FPE
that was conventional set it and I'm not

241
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,980
saying conventional second wasn't good

242
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,030
a lot of organizations today are still
practicing conventional sack and it's

243
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,050
certainly a lot better than doing
nothing you can do conventional second

244
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,670
very well we can do conventional sec
very poorly so this isn't about right or

245
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,189
wrong it's a spectrum it's an evolution

246
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,440
so over the last few years we've been
doing next gen second when I say doing I

247
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,130
mean the information security industry
is all I don't necessarily mean

248
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,500
organizations themselves

249
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,000
so this is when we start to focus on
whether the configurations of our

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,490
systems were what we expected

251
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,790
whether the controls that we expect to
be in place we're actually in place

252
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,780
where before we just trusted they were
we started doing red teaming and purple

253
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,370
teaming teaming we did correlation so
that we didn't spend a lot of time

254
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,410
focusing on respond to attacks or trying
to exploit vulnerabilities that are

255
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,990
already been remediated or for systems
that had very low criticality or low

256
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,670
sensitivity from a data perspective then
we moved into more advanced technology

257
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,260
like detonation

258
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,099
this was originally companies like fire
I so instead of using signature based

259
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,240
technology we started to run now we're
and see how it actually worked

260
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,450
because we recognize that the bad guys
were more advanced than we were from a

261
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,310
defense perspective and things were good
when we got into what was called threat

262
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,060
Intel and run until doesn't just mean a
threat data feed it means a lot more nap

263
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,770
but reality is most organizations are
not ready for credit fail because they

264
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,790
haven't even really started to master
conventional sack but because

265
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,530
conventional sec hasn't been working and
then other organizations stakeholders

266
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,350
heard about next-gen say

267
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,820
they moved on to the next gen sack and I
think that's right or wrong as with a

268
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,439
lot of organizations have done then we
get into some technology that is really

269
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,340
really hard to understand for a lot of
people we talk about Big Data machine

270
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,480
learning it's like calculus and physics
and a lot of math and science it's

271
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,020
really hard to understand and it works
really well but the tricky part is the

272
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,950
tune it management requires more of
those pesky FTEs you need to write

273
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,710
skills and capabilities so none of this
is a magic eight ball

274
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,470
it's right for the right organization
when they're ready and so I want to talk

275
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,270
a little bit again about success and put
a little bit more context around it to

276
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,720
me

277
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,830
success really depends on you an
organization was a success i mean both

278
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,168
for the organization outside of security
ite for the security organization it

279
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,720
sell it for you as an individual

280
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,870
because it's important that you look at
what successes for use an individual

281
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:59,239
that might be increasing your skills and
capabilities that might be putting bread

282
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,950
on the table at home

283
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,500
you have to really decide what's
important to you but when we talk about

284
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,150
what's important to the organization at
least from a security perspective before

285
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,080
let's use the context of effective
security let's think about if we are an

286
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,590
ideal organization won't be doing
effective security in terms of getting

287
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,879
effective results what we want to do
here is for key attributes that I think

288
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,289
are pretty important we can come up a
list of 20 more but for me these are for

289
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,299
that I really focus on being and eyal
and that's the things that we're doing

290
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:34,190
insecurities are they defensible
somebody asks us why we're doing them

291
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,409
can we defend why we choose that
particular thing over something else is

292
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:44,510
it palatable to the organization again
we don't exist from the standpoint of

293
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,408
providing security as an organization we
provide products and services

294
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,150
so if we're preventing the organization
for meeting its current goals and

295
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,130
mission and long-term strategy

296
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,120
the organization may not consider it
palatable we may have an opportunity to

297
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,439
explain how can be done in a powerful
way because they made us understand the

298
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,280
level of pervert burden effort in
friction that maybe cause it's important

299
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,930
to consider level palatability because a
lot of these things on paper or sound

300
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:17,540
really good but when it comes down to
the end of the day requires the

301
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,879
assistance executive support and
collaboration of people outside security

302
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,450
to make these technologies and
approaches work so they have to be

303
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,810
palatable the people that are going to
do them and give you support

304
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,840
you also need credibility and to give an
example of credibility think about some

305
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,870
of the big things that happened over the
last couple years like heartbleed

306
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,449
shell-shocked ransomware if somebody
came to you and stop you in the hallway

307
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,680
and will it work somebody that was a 90
or somebody else I like me and said hey

308
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:54,020
I heard about shell shock on the news on
CNN yesterday you didn't know what it

309
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,040
was

310
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,879
your credibility is probably going to be
pretty low because they heard about it

311
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,910
on local TV they read about it in USA
Today

312
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,350
so it's important to stay in touch wid
what your stakeholders are reading and

313
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,070
seeing even if its mainstream media it's
important to know what's happening in

314
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,330
mainstream media

315
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,310
you definitely have more credibility if
you can answer the question and say I

316
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,110
know what shell-shocked is

317
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,919
here's what it means to us here's what
we're doing about it or here's what we

318
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,420
can do about it

319
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,400
also even better if when you know that
kind of thing is getting mainstream

320
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,150
attention you have a mechanism for
sharing that with the organization or at

321
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,140
least the right stakeholders so they're
not coming to you and telling you about

322
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,520
security issues

323
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,590
you're coming to them and saying I'm
aware of this thing we don't have a

324
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,850
solution for it

325
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,530
we're looking into it it's on a road map
it was number 83 on the list and you can

326
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,180
give us resources for it

327
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,680
here's what we can do and use that as an
example keep it in the back pocket or

328
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,510
tell them what's going on and then
efficacy is a really tricky one because

329
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,640
that's really an eye of the beholder

330
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,330
five

331
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,428
if you're doing something and it's not
working at all then it's not effective

332
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,630
ok so in conventional sac is essentially
taking approaches that are not again not

333
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,830
conventional so not going to go into any
definition there let's just get into it

334
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:24,949
the first example we think about fishing
a lot of mission comes in via email and

335
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,929
a lot of approaches that we have
historically taken our content filtering

336
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:36,830
to block noon websites and webpages they
have fishing forum where people entering

337
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,720
the username and password

338
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,659
blocking emails from low reputation
sources detecting phishing emails

339
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:50,179
appellate come in and educating users
not to click on the phishing email doing

340
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,490
a lot of things that are very reactive
or very technologically focused combined

341
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,049
with educating users on what fishing is
and telling them what it looks like and

342
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:04,700
what to do and what not to do and that's
it work to a large degree unfortunately

343
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,230
unless it's a whaling attack meaning
that the attack is targeting a specific

344
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,559
specific individual or individuals in a
specific role

345
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,139
it's a really bad numbers game so you
can pat yourself on the back and say yes

346
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:22,610
everything we've done vr fishing testing
is demonstrated that we've gone from

347
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,330
eighty five percent of our users
responding to phishing attacks the 20

348
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:32,418
fibers at unfortunately 25-percent
probably too much because as long as

349
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:35,480
they get a foothold in there probably
able to get to the target they want to

350
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,139
get to so I've come up with an approach
and nothing I invented it because there

351
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:45,889
are likely others that are doing it but
I call a black hole night what I did was

352
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,889
I thought about fishing a completely
different way

353
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:52,459
I assume that those controls were going
to be somewhat effective but they were

354
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,710
largely going to fail and I thought more
about fishing in general and what

355
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,539
actually happens in the end result is
generally somebody is responding to an

356
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:06,950
email including their credentials or
they're going to an external web page

357
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,110
and entering their credentials so I
thought even if

358
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:18,939
we didn't know which emails are the ones
that are fishing responses or what web

359
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,730
pages are the ones that are pitching
responses would we just let all the

360
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,210
information from a large collection of
web pages

361
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,379
people are posting form data to or
sending emails to and parse them and

362
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,420
then use the information with part
against our authentication system and

363
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,030
its really not that hard to do

364
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,730
so what I'm talking about is having in
your proxy and this would require for SL

365
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:55,720
from SL inspection because a lot of the
attacks will be posting to CL ssl

366
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,660
enabled web pages so it's not as easy as
it used to be but you can capture all

367
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,490
the information is being posted via a
form and you can basically explode out

368
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,520
all the strings and you knew the user
was it submitted information you can

369
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,809
then just take all that and enumerate it
and send it your authentication system

370
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:20,918
and say log in now you probably want to
do that against your live authentication

371
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,120
system

372
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,850
you probably want to set up a parallel
version you could do the same thing for

373
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,320
email as well

374
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,330
and if you detect that you can log in
that tells you that the password did

375
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,799
appearing that users email or form a
post-it whether they respond to a

376
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,090
phishing email is not necessarily true
but it's a unique false positive

377
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,500
situation because it meant that they
actually posted a form or send an email

378
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,350
with your password in it they could have
set the password for the wife of a

379
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,399
co-worker

380
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,370
it could be that they posted it in a
form because their password is just

381
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,428
something that's not very unique and
something every day

382
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,770
regardless you now detected that they
share their password and if you take

383
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,129
action like disabling their account are
forcing them to change their password

384
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,510
you have now reduced the window with
which the attacker and leverage that

385
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,710
information

386
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,710
so it's a completely different way of
approaching security

387
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,610
so if you're able to leverage that
effectively it doesn't matter if people

388
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,729
respond to phishing attacks and there's
a lot of caveat there are not saying

389
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,340
it's going to solve a hundred percent of
the problem

390
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,178
you can also

391
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,779
expand upon that and take those
passwords and put them in the black list

392
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:28,509
because you could probably assume the
attackers are going to use them again

393
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:32,320
they might also use them against other
user names in your system

394
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,830
assuming that some users may also have
the same password there's a lot more you

395
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,980
can do with it

396
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,240
so the story of the Scorpion and the
Frog in short is the frog and the

397
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,360
Scorpion likes the bike blogs and seeing
them and kill them

398
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,719
the Scorpion wanted it's right on the
frogs back across the river

399
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,100
the Frog hey I know you're a scorpion
you're gonna bite me in the Scorpion

400
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:00,009
said no I won't do that kills those hops
on the Frog back things with the frog

401
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:03,399
frog hey why did you do that ridiculous
but you said you wouldn't do that he

402
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,840
said you guys a scorpion

403
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,418
so this is really a story about knowing
typical behavior both for your users and

404
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,369
for your adversaries

405
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:17,230
so I already gave an example that with
with fishing and we know that

406
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,710
adversaries know that a lot of people
you have the same password reuse it

407
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,009
everywhere so use that information to
your advantage when you're thinking

408
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:28,299
about how to defeat your adversaries or
understand and mitigate where users

409
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:32,830
behavior is still talking about password
I'll just get a simplistic example how

410
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,178
you can use this information

411
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,899
think about a pin code most pain comes
or four digits

412
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:42,459
there's a lot of empirical evidence that
people that create codes we use them

413
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,789
they also fairly often create it in code
is based on the last four of social last

414
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:53,830
quarter phone number or a year of some
relevance which means that a compromise

415
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,820
of a system unrelated to your
organization's could potentially result

416
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,070
in compromise in your organization

417
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,389
there's not really much you can do about
it it's very easy but one thing you can

418
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:10,928
do is recognize this is user behavior an
adversary behavior and change your

419
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:14,799
policy approach simply by requiring a
five digit span

420
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,229
you'll be magnitude better off than if
you had a four digit can still be in a

421
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:25,629
really bad shape but a lot better are in
some cases when you're trying to defeat

422
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,580
opportunistic attacks

423
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,770
that's enough to ensure that your
systems are say so

424
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,520
hey strong attention to your users and
your adversaries in terms of their

425
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,110
behavior is ok let's talk a little bit
about how you can use crowdsourcing so

426
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,219
another risk and someone talking about
now is authentication related and other

427
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,030
risks relates to when somebody forgets
how to get into a camp how they get back

428
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,660
in

429
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,970
pretty often one of the mechanisms are
used sometimes those user contact the

430
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,050
help desk

431
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,399
there goes online answer the security
questions pretty weak and potentially

432
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,200
easily guessable or they have a code
sent to an email which could potentially

433
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,510
compromised the security questions if
you don't know your organization

434
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,010
operates

435
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,980
sometimes the people you're talking to
you actually tell the end-user the

436
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,080
answer the question given hints

437
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,490
there's a lot of ways that is flawed but
because people want things right away

438
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,650
organizations have said we need to get
people cell service in a quick way to

439
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:35,070
get access to your account again i would
say challenge that is five minutes

440
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,689
acceptable is an hour acceptable or does
it have to be five seconds because you

441
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,770
can potentially do things like use
crowdsourcing is most simplest form

442
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,149
it's not crowdsourcing it's validating
that the person who's making the request

443
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,830
is what they say they are one way to do
that is having workflow that requires

444
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,419
that the manager verify that the person
contact the help desk or used online

445
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,430
cell service is who they say they are a
steam just got an email says that you

446
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,400
put in a forgotten password request was
that you

447
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,490
nope oh ok i'm going to click this
button here in deny the request could be

448
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,840
some colleagues at work

449
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,090
you could automatically send an email
out the pod calling to say hey we're

450
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,360
gonna make this person wait four hours
at their password reset you want to help

451
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,870
him get it receptor sooner any two of
you can validate their identity

452
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,870
so you're really crowdsourcing identity
verification

453
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,399
belt with delaying things so this is a
waiting room there's a lot of things you

454
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,570
can do from a security perspective if
you delay the action that can have the

455
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:46,210
adverse effect until you are sure that
you want to take that particular action

456
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,620
too often when we want to automate
provide good customer service we want to

457
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,520
do things right away but because
adversaries can cause a lot of damage in

458
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,070
a very short amount of time potentially
30 minutes after which you have detected

459
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,030
the incident it's too late the damage
has been done and so you have the

460
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:09,190
opportunity to choose lively decide for
a potential critical system or perate

461
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,870
stakeholder that has a lower level of
risk tolerance

462
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,649
you can make these options available for
them and say hey we can do some things

463
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,179
if you're willing to tolerate a little
less customer experience

464
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:29,890
all right this is a sleeping variable is
pretend he's a hibernating bear

465
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,530
so a lot of our systems are about 24
hours a day seven days a week

466
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:40,600
everybody has access the system once the
provision access has access indefinitely

467
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,070
and they have access to all the
functions within the system even if the

468
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,970
system has movement of data in the
organization or the system is extremely

469
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,380
critical

470
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,070
even if the system is only used once per
year for financial purposes and is

471
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,240
highly vulnerable

472
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,960
there's a different way you can do
things think about the contacts if you

473
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,630
have a system that's only used once per
year

474
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,940
highly vulnerable either the system
overall were some service within it

475
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,840
orders users that only need to access it
very infrequently or a particular part

476
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,370
of this very frequently

477
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,090
you can have it all turns off you could
potentially have the whole server

478
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,040
application turn off

479
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,990
there is no attacks are fit for a system
that is not on if it

480
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,770
so on but it's only accessible to IP
addresses of a certain few users during

481
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,510
a certain amount of time where users are
provision real-time access to a system

482
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,190
then the provision access the ability to
exploit vulnerabilities or misuse the

483
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,750
system goes down substantially and today
there's a lot of systems you may have

484
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,130
your organization like service now other
systems like that would allow you to

485
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,370
potentially do this kind of
orchestration to ensure that that user

486
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,020
is taking the steps to say hey I want to
access potentially with or without the

487
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,879
management approval potentially with or
without relating it to change record has

488
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,960
already been approved

489
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,410
so think about the systems you have in
your environment whether there's any

490
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,390
opportunity to have something less than
the entire system turned on all the time

491
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,929
for all data for all users indefinitely

492
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:19,600
you can set booby traps now indiana
jones had a fair idea that this was a

493
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,059
booby traps that means it was pretty
ready for it

494
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,690
I think about some of the things having
organization devices like phones or

495
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,809
laptops get stolen and you don't often
know that they did especially in a BYOD

496
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,309
World War world where you're just not in
the loop in terms of advice getting

497
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:42,040
stolen you maybe find out five days
after the fact but if you have an icon

498
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,639
on your users bones that they know never
click this icon and all that it did was

499
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,820
send a message to one of your systems
and you had an MDM technology that

500
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,780
basically could tell you that somebody
was an adversary has now gotten control

501
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,620
the device so I'm talking about like a
really compelling icon it says this is

502
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,149
the really sensitive system with all the
data really matter what it says doesn't

503
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,429
have to do anything all that powerful

504
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,780
it just needs to learn the user in the
adversary into doing taking some action

505
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,580
like clicking a link right you can also
do that on a desktop so you can do

506
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,960
remote wiping other things based on that
and if you combine this with one

507
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,190
approaches i mentioned earlier the
buffering or waiting room type approach

508
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,680
assuming the user that was authorized
accidentally did it someone to be

509
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,549
notified

510
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:36,990
it could be overridden they could be
contacted the band and so the potential

511
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:40,350
adverse impact the you'd want to avoid
could be avoided

512
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,969
so you have to think about these things
really more holistically

513
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,300
you can also do this with things like a
folder in email a folder that user has

514
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,650
no business going into you can do this
with on grand cloud-hosted technologies

515
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,280
it's really easy to monitor whether a
folder has been opened or emails - read

516
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,260
so just think of these things is early
indicators that somebody bad it's gotten

517
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,360
access to a system or an application or
data and now you've been notified about

518
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,270
it and you have the opportunity to put
in some action either manually

519
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,270
semi-automatically automatically

520
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,560
ok kind of

521
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,038
mine's a canary in the coal mine kind of
things you can do there are create an

522
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:29,460
account that aren't actually being used

523
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,710
put files on your system that you
monitor to see if they've been modified

524
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,460
deleted encrypted that could help you
identify that something like ransomware

525
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,920
is taking place now ransomware typically
is gonna start the first directory in

526
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,670
your file repository the first model
alphabetically

527
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,690
they're smart maybe they start with the
letter Z so you could play some of these

528
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,609
Canaries in strategic locations instead
of having to monitor across hundreds of

529
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:59,520
thousands of files and put the burden in
that level

530
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,480
logging there's not really a downside
because it doesn't cost you anything to

531
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,670
put these cut type of controls in place

532
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,180
you probably don't even need anybody's
permission either going to work was not

533
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,660
so you're getting some learnings and if
you start small

534
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,618
you get new buying to do this bigger
something bad may happen you will be

535
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:20,940
able to say see the bad thing did happen
i now have evidence that we're not a

536
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,089
unique snowflake we're like every other
organization

537
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:27,420
I've been like to expand this

538
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,569
there's some things you can do to scare
adversaries i'm actually going to skip

539
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:36,329
over that but just think about all the
data available to you via JavaScript a

540
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,109
belt

541
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,799
the user and their devices there
geolocation and and think about

542
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:46,349
potentially popping up for them their
location the location in there is police

543
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,170
precinct putting a scary message

544
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,589
now it's an opportunistic or
unsophisticated attacker that might make

545
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:56,759
him stop if it's a sophisticated
attacker might actually lip and say

546
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,349
challenge accepted

547
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:03,960
alright so those are my my technical
examples and I'm going to wrap things up

548
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:08,819
we're talking a little bit more about
questions that i recommend you consider

549
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:12,390
asking yourself as you're thinking about
security

550
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:20,589
I mentioned this earlier what do you
expect to achieve and is

551
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:27,370
what you've done achieving what was
expected to take that a step further if

552
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,040
you put a control in place 10 years ago

553
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,250
let's say a character password after two
different 90 days you felt good at about

554
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,470
it in years ago because of what the
threat and impact environment was are

555
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,939
those constraints requirements and risk
still the same today they may not be so

556
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,080
it's probably worth revisiting whether
the decisions that were made in the past

557
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:55,660
that maybe we're right we're still right
today so let's talk about a couple of

558
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,290
these here and in the top context really
matters because we think about

559
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,400
particular system

560
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,300
what is important for one system may not
be important for another and as part of

561
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,430
what we frustrate people with an idea
and within the organization outside of I

562
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,430
team we did is we see things as one size
fits all

563
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,190
it's a degree it's a trade-off because
simplicity is our brand and so we have

564
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,160
to decide to what degree we want to be
granular and what degree we want to be

565
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,200
simplistic gets here

566
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,319
hybrid approaches appropriate takes a
while to get there but what we found is

567
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,550
an industry or what what I've seen and
what most people i've talked to of it

568
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:39,100
was observed is the word wrangler we've
gotten the last we understand whether

569
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,520
the control we haven't plays are what we
expect them to be are they really in

570
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,390
place are the effective are they being
implemented all of it being understood

571
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,310
that we even understand them

572
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,400
we know there's firewall rules but
they're not commented we really

573
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,960
understand what we actually have and so
simplicity could actually be better than

574
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,040
complexity

575
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,300
alright so inactivity time I was really
a couple places you do that and you on

576
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,750
advice you can do it in an application
but you ask yourself what the point is

577
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,220
when the main points of a device
perspective is I walk away from the

578
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,000
device

579
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,860
hopefully if a bad guys going to come
get access my device he's going to wait

580
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,300
15 minutes

581
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,260
not good access 14 minutes after I left
my devices is it

582
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,690
so if we think about what we're trying
to achieve it make you feel good it will

583
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,180
actually provide some value

584
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,259
use a belt and suspenders type control
so there's something bad does happen we

585
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,730
can say hey we have no evidence that the
person got in there within 15 minutes

586
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,530
we're pretty sure the data to save and
so it does have some value but if we

587
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,240
want to ensure that your malicious
coworker somebody that has access to the

588
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,990
computer when you went to the bathroom
and forgot to lock it doesn't get active

589
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,919
system

590
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,420
maybe there's a way to actually lock the
device without you having to take action

591
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,190
and there are ways to do that with
proximity-based devices so your

592
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,420
applications you can stall on your phone
via bluetooth and other mechanisms can

593
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,630
detect you grew far enough away from the
device that the device is able to ping

594
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,690
it and it will lock the vines

595
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,579
there's also hardware that can do that
it works pretty well and as long as the

596
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,930
device stays in the users pocket is not
with the laptop provides a fairly high

597
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:27,299
level advocacy password expirations are
fairly interesting because they've

598
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,220
actually led to unintended consequences
but I'm gonna talk about the

599
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,700
consequences in a bit

600
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,140
matching so we all the way we should do
patching but for a long time we've been

601
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:47,190
patching once a year every 90 days every
30 days sometimes every 30 days means

602
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,720
30 from 30 days with the the start point
being the point at which the vendor

603
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,009
released the patch

604
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,359
sometimes it just means it's something
we do every 30 days on the calendar and

605
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,930
maybe we're pushing out a patch that is
two years old but we're doing it every

606
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,868
30 days are always two years behind bars
every 30 days

607
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,230
so we're good the policy should have
been worded that way they didn't want to

608
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,040
do that

609
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,509
well 10 years ago it was really hard to
exploit vulnerabilities

610
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,598
i'm just using 10 is a round number now
it's pretty easy pretty easy to go bye

611
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:25,410
go on the black or green market hit
rootkits get exploit kits is now where's

612
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,430
the service

613
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,629
you don't even have to really know what
you're doing and ignoring O'Day's

614
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:36,150
vulnerabilities that are announced at
the same time that there's a patch

615
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,509
even if it's not clear how to exploit
the vulnerability

616
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,010
if the software is widely used their
vulnerabilities easy to reverse you can

617
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,470
probably expect it could be very quick

618
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,629
less than a day or a few days between
the time the vulnerability is announced

619
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,910
the patches out there and there's an
exploit in the wild either via a project

620
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,490
like metasploit or just from adversaries
were using it from a black a perspective

621
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,740
so is patching really providing us a lot
of value i think it really depends on

622
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,549
the contact you take something like
flash and let's say that on average

623
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:17,370
every five days after there's a flash
update his exploits for that

624
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,009
vulnerability if you're patching every
30 day you're giving yourself with

625
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,600
twenty five day window exploitability
that's never good so you're really only

626
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,150
buying you know you're not really buying
yourself a lot of time and now if you're

627
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,930
not patching that frequently or you're
patching through an older version is

628
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,279
already vulnerable with malware that's
already out there then you're not really

629
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,090
doing anything at all except patting
yourself on the back and improving some

630
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:47,790
of your statistics because of the goal
of patch management is to reduce the

631
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,460
exploitation of vulnerabilities against
the system that you really have your

632
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,710
environment that's not necessarily
helping you

633
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,000
and if there's always or abilities on
your systems that are ones that are not

634
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,650
patched because you're only patching OS
or you only patching adobe products and

635
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,050
Oracle products you may not be providing
the value that you hope you're providing

636
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,800
and sometimes that's because of resource
restrictions and so I'm not saying no

637
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,870
patch but think about what the advocacy
is and whether it makes sense to take a

638
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,859
different approach

639
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,390
maybe the patching is the right thing
for you to do terms of unintended

640
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:26,490
consequences field login account locking
is pretty Tom and I really hate this

641
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,839
control is basically what you're doing
is you're given adversaries the way to

642
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,810
lock Stevens account out see where he
doesn't like that

643
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,620
so if you know my username you're given
the attackers a way to lock out my

644
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,859
account especially if there is an
authentication service that's on the

645
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,840
public internet and that affects my
ability even on the internet login and

646
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,300
if the attacker can get all the
usernames you're potentially given the

647
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,200
the way via something like powershell to
very quickly

648
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,610
lock out every single account in the
environment eventually not just user

649
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,440
accounts with privilege and system
account as well so i would say think

650
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,580
about that control you haven't plays if
you don't even know whether you have

651
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,680
that in place or what the settings are
take a look at it and ask your ite

652
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,060
colleagues

653
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,420
what is actually in place and what are
they experiencing and ask the question

654
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,110
if this happened what what we actually
do what we actually happen to us

655
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,250
I can see it some organizations it
brings down production

656
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:30,550
maybe millions of dollars so they're not
necessarily having strong success with

657
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,120
that type of approach and if we look at
authentication tests today they're

658
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,690
largely not happening it's online system
so it's not really necessarily providing

659
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,550
value password expiration really results
in users creating more simplistic

660
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,790
passwords the fall festival patterns

661
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,860
so you're actually making it easier for
the adversaries to gain access and

662
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,840
regain access to your systems are
skipped

663
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:04,500
except this a deployment rule sets and
user agent content filtering the

664
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,940
applications you have that need to run
very old Java can be configured so they

665
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,050
can but all the sites that are going to
exploit your environment won't get

666
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,350
access to those older versions of Java
the new versions of Java really secure

667
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:21,029
if you have a laptop is going to China
typically and commit and how to come

668
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,630
back and you're like it but what if the
hardware from where bios have been

669
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,590
modified

670
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,160
you have to hamper tape on it you wait
to see if it weighs the same even if it

671
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,580
weighs the same as I tell you the
hardware was not modified probably not

672
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,420
why not just take that laptop and sell
it on eBay

673
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,130
why not just shred it because if you
shred that lot laptop for the infrequent

674
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,980
times that people visit you have these
hostile countries

675
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,700
it will probably cost you less money
than the effective controls that you

676
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,839
would put into place

677
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,140
now the organization may laugh but if
you show them the numbers at least you

678
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,509
would have something defensible

679
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:59,520
all right these last two here are really
just to say if somebody ask you in the

680
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,480
hallway

681
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,130
814 password database is published what
would actually mean to us so we really

682
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,070
good shape that happen how we respond

683
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,220
what we had ransomware to be back up all
our data how much would be lose

684
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,730
make sure you know enough about your
environment to answer those questions

685
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,899
alright so one

686
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,099
fuck with four challenges the first one
is not really specific to this

687
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,150
conference that really relates to your
environment if you don't know what the

688
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,619
impacts are they could occur from a
technical and business perspective with

689
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,230
the general threats or that you should
be worried about your arm and I both

690
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,140
mean the sources of threats in the
attack vectors

691
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,470
you don't know your environment like are
things being backed up for people going

692
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,129
these kind of sides of people using java
we have systems that are highly

693
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,450
vulnerable and you don't know what
success is to you in the organization

694
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:54,270
you're really working from a bad
starting point then the rest of what you

695
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,599
can do is things you can control and
influence you don't have a lot of

696
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,160
control over everything that you at
least have the ability to influence you

697
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,069
can tell the organization there's a bad
thing that can happen

698
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:08,279
I don't think it's highly likely but
here's what we can do about it

699
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:12,510
and then when the shell shock her heart
bleed or cryptolocker show up you can

700
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,549
say talk to you about it

701
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:17,788
here's what you do about it we're ready
to go we're not ready to go but here's

702
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:18,869
what we do

703
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:24,869
there's so many things you can't control
why not that much value to worry about

704
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,010
those things you should be aware of them
but you spend all your time ranting and

705
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,819
raving about the things you can control
time and effort you can expand on things

706
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,549
you can control it's not gonna help you
be successful

707
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:39,599
alright so the first real challenge is
the step outside your comfort zone

708
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,868
now I know a lot of you have done that
because this is your first time at a

709
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:46,589
security conference so congratulations
you step outside your comfort zone

710
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:50,700
learn a lot from the recession learn a
lot from the people you talked with

711
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,779
share information with others get to
know people in attendance session you

712
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:59,430
normally wouldn't so if you only attend
sessions they have the new sexy hot

713
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:05,520
because you're a breaker you do one
that's our defense related go to

714
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,940
something you would not normally go to
because it may expose you to a different

715
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,900
technology our way of thinking you
wouldn't otherwise come across you spend

716
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,520
all your time the echo chamber

717
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,839
you're only going to see a very limited
part of what other scene at the way I

718
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,319
get a lot of values I talk a lot of
people they're smarter than me more

719
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,349
experienced mean they're just in
different domains in organizations and I

720
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:29,430
introduce yourself to somebody new maybe
learn a lot don't you talk to people

721
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,839
that you know here

722
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:36,960
all right share something I share some
information with you it's not all rocket

723
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,769
science

724
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:41,339
you may have something small you may
have something big I want to hear from

725
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,470
you after this meeting

726
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,439
I'm glad to share more with you want to
hear from you i want to learn from you

727
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,979
hear something at least one thing with
somebody else during the conference even

728
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:51,450
if you think it's pretty minor

729
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,450
even if it's just a proper ID you have
you don't know if it will work

730
00:48:55,259 --> 00:49:03,239
alright so my last and final challenge
for you is to take those ideas or

731
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:10,410
approaches that you learn during
converge and pursuing and I've learned

732
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,589
least for me and a lot of your product
the same way to pursue something to get

733
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:16,259
a lot of excitement from a conference
like this guy a lot of good ideas you

734
00:49:16,259 --> 00:49:19,440
plan on doing something with it
completely forget the next conference

735
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,609
you go to and keep going through that
cycle so i encourage you to do what I do

736
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:28,109
right idea down right and commitment to
yourself then i'm going to do something

737
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:31,109
about an idea i'm gonna pursue one of
these approaches i don't necessarily

738
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:32,460
know which one it is

739
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,059
I'm gonna get myself a deadline like
labor day and put on a sticky note

740
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,789
put it on your computer do whatever you
have to do to make sure it's common

741
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:42,869
eight and hold yourself accountable for
that and then sure what you learn

742
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,680
love to see on social media you sure
that you try something you give me a lot

743
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,368
of excitement you contact me and said
hey one thing is you tried or told me

744
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:53,279
about or something else I learned here's
what I tried

745
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:56,430
and here's what I learned from it that
that would make me feel really great

746
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,850
alright so this

747
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:03,620
what my name is I i think i did a decent
job addict my goal wasn't really that

748
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,670
high

749
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,870
so hopefully I achieve it and the last
thing I want to leave you with is

750
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:14,210
fascinating different definition of a
hacker by Steven Levy was from an

751
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:20,150
article Computerworld don't have the
date and II something like 1982 right so

752
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:25,010
this is what his definition was asked
what is the hacker hacker is a person

753
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:31,700
whose devotion of something in this case
computers is near total and who has a

754
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:37,609
deep City see the desire to do what
impossible

755
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,859
I think the great thing about hackers it
quite often they achieve is what is

756
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,730
considering possible because they
refused to accept limits

757
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,600
I guess the other aspects of hacker ism

758
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,650
which is the word we need to bring back
is an insatiable quest for information

759
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,730
and knowledge and this is not a hacker
conference per se it's a security

760
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,080
conference

761
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,980
I think whether your insecurities or
whatever field you're in this really

762
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,890
resonates with me and I hope it
resonates with you because i think it's

763
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,819
something that we've lost in the hacker
and security community

764
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:17,870
this deep-seated . desire to do what's
impossible versus using best practice

765
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:24,560
and the tools that are available and
refusing to accept limits the desire to

766
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,520
think differently and beyond how we
would normally think the quest for

767
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,190
knowledge learning from others and
learning what's out there and trying new

768
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,970
things

769
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,149
I think it's something that we've
largely lost so I'm hoping you'll think

770
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,980
about this and the challenges that I
laid out today and think about it as you

771
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,960
attend the rest of the conference

772
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,740
i think i am all the time in 40 seconds

773
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:51,680
so I'm dropping my virtual Mike
appreciate your time thank you

774
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,950
yeah

775
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,080
yeah
