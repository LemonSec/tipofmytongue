1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
I'm so this is going to be hopefully a
little bit different of a talk than most

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,010
of the ones here today

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,320
I think it's really important I think
it's something we all need to

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,519
participate in

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,509
but but I hope during the next 15
minutes or so I don't bore you and put

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,560
you to sleep because if you do I'm going
to walk up beside you and and give you

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,549
boo

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,359
so Who am I just a real brief

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,730
so you know who i am and what I'm doing
here so I work for ntt in case you don't

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,459
want any tea is the world's largest
phone company

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,270
we r out about forty percent of the
world's internet traffic where largest

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,550
data center provider in the world and we
happen to own by financial footprint the

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,760
largest security delivery organizations
in the world

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,649
so about 1.4 billion in revenue but that
doesn't really matter

15
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,690
hear what it reason i say that and the
reason I talk about myself just so

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,968
briefly is I need you to understand of
where I'm talking from i'm not talking

17
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:10,560
down to the tactical level here i'm a
strategic person and I as part of my

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,020
remit from ntt is a little bit bigger
than most people's because we are a

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,399
global phone company

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,990
I actually have a remit to take and make
security more effective in the world and

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,070
i'll get you and talk to you about why
we do that and so forth as i go through

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,579
this talk but I'm really here for a
whole bunch of different reasons and for

23
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,110
today's presentation and have a lot of
build so I apologize for that but i

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,610
really want to take and make you uneasy

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,079
i'm sure a lot of people probably here
will call me an idiot by the time we're

26
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,039
done feel free

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,350
I'm good with that I working security a
lot of people call me an idiot but the

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,130
UH purpose is that I'm going to battle
with you for a while

29
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,560
i will give you my thoughts on a
solution to the problem we have out

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
there on i'm going to open the floor for
discussion when i'm done assuming I not

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,539
talk for too long

32
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:16,450
and I want you to be feel free during
this to stop interrupt me at any time

33
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,129
and if you do think that I'm an idiot
and we're going down the wrong path and

34
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,590
yet God get rid of this guy

35
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,829
please call me out because I think
that's important here

36
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:31,989
part of my job is to work with people
and part of my job because I work in R&D

37
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:37,180
is to fail and if I failed here i need
to know it fast fail fast and move on

38
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,170
with our lives

39
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,129
so I really want your participation in
here

40
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,569
this isn't me about me talking at you
well some of it is but it's about you

41
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,349
also talking to me because that's the
way I work

42
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:55,358
so let's so let's go on and actually get
to the meat of what's going on here so

43
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,599
in this presentation I hope to do the
following

44
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,619
I'm going to make you uncomfortable
because I'm going to say things about us

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,549
that we all know but I think it's
important for getting to a solution

46
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,700
hopefully I'll hurry goes a bit when
security were all bit arrogant about

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,978
that we know better than you how to get
in and do things right let's face it we

48
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,280
do isn't it great that we can break into
your system and show you that we're

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,569
better that you had it

50
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,638
I want to take an abuse that a bit and
I'm going to hopefully suggest some

51
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,889
things that you haven't considered about
where we are in this industries and ways

52
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,040
we as a whole can do something different

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,269
now we're all testers on the pen tester
I do GRC I do

54
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,650
product implementation I build platforms
i do lots of different things but I

55
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,500
don't think that's enough for what we do
in security and I don't think we as the

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,680
community that is the security
professionals that people doing stuff

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,609
the people

58
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,769
proving where the problems are and going
and fifty fixing it is where it needs to

59
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,549
be as a general whole and we'll talk
about that here in a second but first of

60
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,979
all let's set set the stage

61
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:11,680
so you know that's when always connected
digital world and that world is growing

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,810
really really fast right all those
things up there

63
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,608
how many but 5 10 years ago those things
didn't exist and they're now all major

64
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,229
industries right

65
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,860
well maybe social existed like yes you
know my space but whatever the nature of

66
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,660
our game is our digital world and the
things that we're protecting insecurity

67
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,110
if you take a look at all the analyst
reports and that how bigs are going to

68
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,540
be in the next 10 years what a hundred
times the size that we have here and I

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,690
think we all know security professionals
we suck at protecting what we already

70
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,590
have off of the footprint that already
exists

71
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,770
what's it going to be when all these
things get to their size and scope that

72
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,799
the analyst talk about over the next 10
years

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,790
and if you think about it and we are not
talking about what the solution is here

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,960
yet but think about setting the stage is
this is what our road map has really

75
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,169
been and I know this is generalized that
but this is the truth right

76
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,160
we have said hey here's our security
implementation but that's what we want

77
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,860
to expect and that's what everyone wants
right easy transparent I don't have to

78
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,540
think about it it's just there and as we
all know because we're all in the

79
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,710
security business

80
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:32,260
that's not the reality about their can
we think of one thing out there that we

81
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,730
as the security industry trust to have
done security right

82
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,910
that's a question to the audience how
many people out here can think of one

83
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,150
thing that we have trust to have done
security right

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,150
anyone

85
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:54,580
ok so effectively small number of
answers here

86
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,510
I agree or disagree i don't know Bob but
yeah let's face it

87
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,289
not much is going on there and I've done
enough tests I've been enough things to

88
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,450
know that I got lifetime employment just
doing pen test right because we haven't

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,680
done it right and the reality is that we
have what's called with expectation gap

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,250
we're here and we have expected that but
if you think about it we actually have

91
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,330
an exploitation gap right goes from the
expectation cap - what everyone really

92
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,340
wants and the question i have for us as
we've been doing this for a long time

93
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,049
I've been in security

94
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,050
God since 1998 how many years of that

95
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,960
I haven't seen any thing fixed and I
don't know about you guys but on the

96
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,900
long term on the way we go about doing
things

97
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,799
yeah we'll fix this for now but in six
months when we test again in the same

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,810
things different story right

99
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,629
I want to know how we managed to get the
expectation gap out there

100
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,720
shouldn't our expectations be what our
customers and what we are doing

101
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,500
how many of us have actually closed the
expectation gap for all that security

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,360
work that we've done and let's think
about this a little bit more in a global

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:16,430
space scale last 10 years we have spent
as a globe 500 billion dollars on

104
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,469
security 500 billion dollars according
to gartner report that i read a couple

105
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,250
days ago they expect next year spend to
be a hundred and fourteen billion which

106
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,430
means the next 10 years probably be in
the trillions right and we've managed to

107
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,379
take and cost companies two trillion
dollars in that same time frame

108
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,279
ok we spent 500 million dollars billion
dollars and its cost us two trillion

109
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,409
dollars and that's the trajectory of
where we're going and security the bad

110
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,620
guys are only getting worse than anyone
here

111
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,630
name one thing we have done last 20
years that have changed that trajectory

112
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,830
that it hasn't been increasing year to
year

113
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,340
great

114
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,150
I actually did y2k work I actually
helped make sure the power stayed on in

115
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,989
the country

116
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:18,470
I power companies trade right power and
that was a teacher a certificate based

117
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,120
system and it was not y2k compliant and
so I set in utah on y2k and make sure

118
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,200
the lights went on

119
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,169
and since was only six o'clock in London
where our clocks were set then I went

120
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:34,039
skiing so it's great on the the net was
nothing has changed there

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,240
Bravo and good job to us right now

122
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,620
I say that a bit sarcastically we've all
done a really great job but there's a

123
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,280
lot of things in our way to achieve that

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,500
and the question is can we as the people
whose whose job it is to change that

125
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,530
do something about it and so that's the
crux of my presentation by the way I put

126
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,290
these on your deliberately small so you
have to strain to read about it think

127
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,949
that there's a little bit too small so
i'll read that has been reading my own

128
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,800
screen is uh let's think about where did
we get get it to get here so i have a

129
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,750
little quote here and it's rather long
and boring but in the seventies and

130
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,620
eighties their stories of individual
bank tellers embezzlement phone

131
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,250
preclinical a computerized systems and
searchable free long distance and

132
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,280
college students breaking into the
Department of Defense communication

133
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,040
system so that was me anyways up today
cybercriminals the black cats do and act

134
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,949
like the Mafia

135
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,330
all right we all agree on this and if
you actually think about it i work in

136
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,300
Silicon Valley one of the great things
we talked about Silicon Valley's the

137
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,380
digital business

138
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,530
what's the best example of the digital
business that we have out there

139
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,120
cyber criminal world they've done crowd
sourcing for years and years and years

140
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,980
they have resources on demand nothing
centralized hey you want to buy any one

141
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,210
of your skill sets

142
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,560
fifty bucks one hour not a problem right
they have all that out there they are

143
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,060
the ideal business

144
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,020
digital business out there and they also
say I saw a news report the other day in

145
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,990
England the cyber

146
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,399
criminals are now bigger than the
physical criminals out there that cross

147
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,600
that threshold

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,290
it's also what and the Rigel I work in
an agile world I know how hard that is

149
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,829
actually to do in relapse reality and in
fact they've done it right

150
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,100
um and the question of the day I think
is how the hell did we get from that to

151
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,750
that right

152
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,050
what changed in the way that we did
security what we are actually doing

153
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,469
security now but you know what change
why haven't we been successful and I'm

154
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,529
going to actually postulate something
that will probably piss off the entire

155
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:51,310
audience but we are part of not
necessarily just the solution but also

156
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,040
part of the problem and i'm going to
take and talk about that move through a

157
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,599
couple exercises here to see if I can
prove that point and then what we can do

158
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,350
about it

159
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,850
going forward by the way i actually
wrote that text there in a book that i

160
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,830
published but I think it's really true

161
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:13,540
so i will admit that that was my own
stuff here so i have a story to tell

162
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,750
night like to say securities a bit like
a wedding right

163
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:23,020
and the where we play the role in this
is really part of that story so if you

164
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,420
imagine this man in a husband and wife
they get married

165
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,010
beautiful ceremony the ceremony you've
ever seen they have a lovely reception

166
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,290
great fantastic they go on honeymoon
it's amazing they come back to domestic

167
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,849
life they live just their normal
domestic lives for a year or two and

168
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,050
then the wife's sister is getting
married right

169
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,430
fantastic time she goes upstairs she
gets already she does her hair she does

170
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,310
all those things that women do that i
just don't understand to get ready

171
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,589
anyways it comes back downstairs and
there's her husband on the lazy boy

172
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,589
bud light and one and cheetos and the
other crumbs

173
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,939
you know watching the blackhawks game
and i say that because I'm from Chicago

174
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,130
not Detroit bomb

175
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:16,960
you know the punch line is they is the
Red Wings winning so yeah go ahead boo

176
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,320
me

177
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,690
ah anyways anyways it comes back and she
says oh what are you doing

178
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,860
don't let my sister's wedding to go to
and he goes honey look I understand that

179
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,260
she's your sister and everything but
this one

180
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,180
you're gonna have to do alone right you
know go there you can probably to sit

181
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,510
with yourself with a table full of other
couples i know it would be awkward but

182
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,950
you know you'll manage

183
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,420
they'll probably be you know you know
dancing and hopefully we'll do the

184
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,079
electric slide so you don't need a
partner and and so forth

185
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,220
it will be will be lovely you enjoy it
it's your sister but you know you're

186
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,920
going to have to do it on your own and
she looks as what

187
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,079
what does my sister's wedding he does
look look honey I want you to understand

188
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,550
while you're there while you're at this
wedding i'm going to be in this lazy boy

189
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,699
and be watching the Chicago team
Blackhawks here

190
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,480
hopefully the win hopefully the win

191
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,630
I'm going to be enjoying myself
immensely just as you're enjoying

192
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,270
yourself immensely immensely but I want
you to know this entire wedding thing

193
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,310
i've done at once

194
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:36,880
I think I'm good now isn't that a bit
like how we how our customers how we

195
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,890
implement security right

196
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,699
we know it I got it it's good right

197
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,790
you've told me what to do i practiced it
right

198
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,670
do we actually as security professionals
and our customers and let's face it the

199
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,709
rest of the people out there actually go
about doing the things that we say we do

200
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,410
on a rigorous basis all the time like we
say we're supposed to do and I make it

201
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,490
better and i will actually take and do a
little test here in a bit that we don't

202
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,600
and i asked the question is is that
helping or hurting our cause here is our

203
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,510
cause

204
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,910
he is to be successful at our jobs and
prevent cyber crime from happening and

205
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,410
we all know

206
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,610
cybercrime does happen in fact that
keeps us nice lifetime employment but in

207
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,510
theory we should be putting ourselves
out of a job right now the question I'm

208
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,610
going to ask all of you is what happens
if we're ever successful in doing that

209
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,340
what happens to the cyber criminal
element if we are in fact successful and

210
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,300
our job

211
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,089
it's just something for you think about
what works what will we do when we talk

212
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,130
about this here for a while

213
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:52,700
okay that's great and again too small
for us to read dear god what have we

214
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,120
done so i'm going to suggest a blow

215
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,640
it's really loud I'm gonna suggest a
bunch of things that really feed into

216
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,350
this that are out there that are
interface that we're not addressing as

217
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,960
the people who are the implementers the
testers the people validating it

218
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
the users because we are in fact users
of security right

219
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,589
that is actually not helping us in fact
hurting us and we're all ignoring out

220
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,990
there I'm gonna suggest seven things
there may be more

221
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,960
maybe you don't agree with all these
seven I put these out there is the ones

222
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,870
that I see out there and then we're
going to talk about what we might be

223
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,130
able to do about it

224
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,370
so the first thing you're gonna do is
you're gonna probably call me an idiot

225
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,410
on this but I'm gonna put it up there
anyways

226
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,860
what are the seven things that are
destroying our world

227
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:46,250
the bad guys are human well that's a
pretty stupid statement of course

228
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,720
they're human they're not machines in
that but the way that we treat them is

229
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,060
not in a human manner

230
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,780
right there a thing that comes and
knocks on our door and does something

231
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,520
and repeats maybe later on but there's a
person behind it and the reason that I

232
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,890
say that this is important is machines
do with their program to maybe bad

233
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,620
programming it may be mistakes and
programming but they do with their

234
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,880
program to do

235
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,510
humans don't humans are incentivized to
succeed

236
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,990
now think about that we're in the
security world right

237
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,290
our job is to prevent someone from
succeeding

238
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,270
so what's the other side of the equation
doing they're human they're not a

239
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,400
machine they're not mechanical

240
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,790
they have huge amounts of money at stake

241
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,510
the numbers like five hundred seventy
five billion dollars this year that

242
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,270
they're going to steal to keep doing
what they're doing and so if we're out

243
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,270
there doing security what is the natural
reaction

244
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,800
I will figure out a way around you i
will do it to someone else i will come

245
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,290
up with another way to succeed because i
am financially incentivized to do it and

246
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,599
in fact they're so financially
incentivize what will happen when we

247
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,740
succeed and cut them off of their
funding by making them stop

248
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,530
think about that for a second a 500
billion dollar corporation if we succeed

249
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,230
it's stopping them from earning 500
billion dollars what are they going to

250
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,410
do with the guys they don't know I'm
just going to get a real job

251
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:24,350
I mean think about it what are they
going to do if we succeed at doing our

252
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,399
job

253
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,640
well they're going to keep doing it
they're going to do in a different way

254
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
and i'll give you the example right now
we all know that you know there's the

255
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,820
thing going on where someone fakes an
email from the CFO to the sort of CEO to

256
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,570
the CFO and says he changed the bank
account number and so they sit

257
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,179
they pay their vendors to the wrong
account it's actually the bad guys

258
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,670
accounting they walk away with the money
right

259
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,790
what's the next logical step of that
process

260
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,129
why the hell do i have to take and send
a fake email if i'm going to take a rip

261
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,180
off all five million dollars when I just
go to the CFO's house and hold a gun to

262
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,910
his head and having just transfer the
money

263
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,800
how far away do you think we are from
that ok

264
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,919
yet hold it there hate cabin call and
say I'm sick today I'm not gonna be in

265
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,150
money is transferred

266
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,400
we stole it at the other end walk away
right

267
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,410
it's been done and how much more time do
you think it's going to be before it

268
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,390
becomes commonplace right

269
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:27,960
we didn't shoot people in universities
until a couple years ago now everyone

270
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
does it

271
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,230
right I to use that as an example but
that's a great example of once it's ok

272
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,330
everyone is going to do it and where are
we in this equation in stopping people

273
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,909
from getting to that point

274
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,840
well the fact is is that they're human
and what we do is going to be very

275
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,040
reactive

276
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
so let's talk about what's next up there

277
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,940
we have three billion people in the
carbon layer of security is everyone

278
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,400
know with carbon layer is of security

279
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,530
that's people right carbon layer network
layer wirelessly at it

280
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:11,100
carbon layer and ok it's like invented a
15 stood anyways anyways we have three

281
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,990
billion people in this world

282
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,050
how many people are covered by folks
like us

283
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,460
what tiny percentage of our population
in this world are actually meaningfully

284
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,390
managed by security professionals in
some way shape or form

285
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,220
what ten percent twenty percent maybe

286
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,940
so what's the remaining whatever percent
that is to the cybercrime community

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:48,090
i'm sorry but i would dispute that I
would call it the testing ground

288
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,169
so yes they may not be a nuttin not
enough money to bother but where is the

289
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,810
Cyber Crimes biggest investment

290
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,870
where do they spend the money it's not
in attacking you

291
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:07,739
it's in figuring out how to attack you
successfully right and then replicated a

292
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,450
hundred times if you guys are doing your
jobs right we're preventing it we put up

293
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,770
firewalls we have labs with security
policies we have compliance we have two

294
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,350
factor authentication you name all the
things that we do

295
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,919
where do we take a test the men the
people who are less protected right

296
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,030
and all the way down to the ignorant
masses that are out there that's the

297
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,639
breeding ground for us we can't see it
we have no visibility into it that yet

298
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,800
that is the testing ground for breaking
into where the real money is

299
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,030
and being in the front intelligence
space that I am I happen to know that

300
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,149
there's a lot of money to be made on the
people who don't have any money but

301
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,280
that's not a short mom so I would say
that that is the second part of our

302
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,540
problem we are doing nothing for the
vast majority of the people out there

303
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,940
question or raising it

304
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,660
ok so that's number number but the next
one there

305
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,910
out number number six so the next one
and it goes along the same thing here is

306
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:14,800
we're all great for whatever we do in
security but most security is DIY right

307
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,960
do it yourself what is the way that we
go about doing it does someone who

308
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,310
actually knows what they're doing

309
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:26,200
implement most of the security in the
world and how many people have actually

310
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,230
tested things to actually know that even
the people who do not know what they're

311
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,800
doing are you know entirely perfect in
their process right

312
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,080
so if most security is DIY and
apparently want two slides there

313
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,199
sorry I don't know why my transitions
went bad but ok we'll go on to the next

314
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,950
one

315
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:53,590
tom is we also don't share now 5 i'll
tell you the story here a little bit but

316
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,600
i'm a big proponent of sharing what the
hell happened to me so it can prevent it

317
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,010
from happening to you

318
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,970
how many of us share out that
information or even have the political

319
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,670
will and our customers in our own
organizations for ourselves to actually

320
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,260
share what happened to us so that it
doesn't happen to someone else

321
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:20,379
what's the percentage there is it in the
single digits is it less i do threat

322
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,820
intelligence I Michael win millions and
millions millions of Records a day

323
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,330
I can tell you that's a tiny fraction of
what i can actually see on my networks

324
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,810
20,000 the second / cnc note

325
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,040
the net is we don't share it

326
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,930
let's think about the other side of the
community what is happening on in the

327
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,180
bad guys world right

328
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,850
they share everything for a price but
they share everything you need to know a

329
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,270
new exploit $5,000 maintenance included
right

330
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,520
if you need to take a know how to get
into a customer system after i'm done

331
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,510
exploiting it

332
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,890
fine I'll take and provide that
information probably for free but we on

333
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,950
the other side we don't say I've been
attacked

334
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,100
this is what they did to me here's what
I did to prevent it

335
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,540
how are we supposed to do it given the
Spartan information that's available

336
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,240
from preventing it right

337
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,030
how many actual breach notifications
occur versus the number actual breaches

338
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,139
that are occur

339
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,120
I mean let's face it how many of you
have run pen test and it's all over the

340
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,989
place and you know you're not the first
person there but there's nothing that is

341
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,700
done about it

342
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,900
there's no investigation of what may
have happened wait we don't know right

343
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,140
the reality is there is no sharing in
this community now I will also say that

344
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,090
we are changing on that front and i'll
talk about that here a little bit later

345
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,570
so apparently i had this in the wrong
order but that's okay

346
00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:00,909
DIY that's next fine ok next one is but
now picky picky picky

347
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,639
make sure the right hands up there huh

348
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,840
there is no central reference for
security get any person here and I'm a

349
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,570
GRC person as much as in the pen tester
here

350
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,550
tell me what standard I follow for
security anyone

351
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,750
ok just baseline passwords anyone can
tell me what the standard is to do

352
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,160
passwords

353
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,870
the most common security control we have
in the world anyone anyone

354
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,470
now which one to follow

355
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,179
what's our reference what's our
reference missed

356
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:50,520
I so Japanese national standards pci
what's our reference

357
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,730
some guy who wrote on his blog what's a
reference and that's the most common

358
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,830
thing that we do

359
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,040
by the way I'm trying to get rid of
passwords so you want to see something

360
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,800
to visit milagro project Apache another
story

361
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,740
anyways we have an essential reference
for this and we all have very

362
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,360
complicated standards

363
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:13,620
I was a pci assessor all through 232
controls god what a thing to implement

364
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:19,560
you know I've done I so oh god I've done
our own internal ones which are worse

365
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,750
lot of Japanese think it but that the
net net is we don't have it how are we

366
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,340
actually supposed to have those eighty
percent of people out there that have no

367
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,770
security out there do anything if you
guys were any of you were at the pc at

368
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,940
Black Caps two years ago and went to the
keynote presentation there's a great

369
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,300
speech there that talked about someone
trying to a a butcher was breached a

370
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,419
single small business owner had an old
credit card

371
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,560
pc in the back corner for 10 years it
was breached hundreds of transactions

372
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,419
law so they made him go through an audit
and trying to explain to some guy whose

373
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,720
job is to chop up animals how to do pci

374
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,060
because its systems were breached I mean
think about that for a second

375
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,669
he does have a butcher knife that
doesn't help you if you're 5,000 miles

376
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:18,420
away but you know that's the reality of
that we don't have a reference right or

377
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,980
even a simple reference

378
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,720
here's the 10 things you need to do in
all cases and can we even write that I

379
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,440
think we probably could write at least
something that people could have as a

380
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,000
standard um or a reference

381
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,680
forget the standard just as a reference
number two

382
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:44,280
almost no one is arrested

383
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,000
I counted it up last year and I don't
know the number still there less than

384
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,850
500 people in the history of cybercrime
have been arrested starting at kevin

385
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,770
Mitnick ok

386
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:02,850
500 people do you know how many people I
am tracking or maybe people may not want

387
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,179
to look as soon as people that I am
tracking my threat intelligence network

388
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:13,560
they're performing cybercrime right now
I want to look last night 1.2 million do

389
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,850
we ever facilitate the arrest of the
people that is our problem if you're not

390
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,199
gonna get arrested and you make stupid
amounts of money and nothing is going to

391
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,100
happen to you

392
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,110
why would you ever stop doing it now of
course we don't want stops we make lots

393
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,290
of money as professionals doing it we
saw lots of product but the reality is

394
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,700
is we don't as a society what these
things to be happening yet we're not

395
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,260
doing any real thing about it i was at
RSA this year and like there's 40,000

396
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,190
people here

397
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,350
there's 5,000 vendors and that not a
single one of them has stopped the

398
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:55,230
problem stopped being prevented from
ever happening again arrested a person

399
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,890
done anything

400
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,810
no one has so from a personal note I
actually have people on my staff who are

401
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,690
connected the law enforcement i'm
actually trying to do something about it

402
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,820
as an international telco but even that
it's it's it's a thing but let's think

403
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,659
about it

404
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,900
what have we ever done what have you
done in your businesses or you as a

405
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,140
person to ever help

406
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,470
facilitate that unless the FBI ecology
and says I need some records

407
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,070
what have you ever done a question

408
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:29,139
anyone anyone done anything hey one
great but hundred people in this room

409
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,100
k 1 percent that's better than zero so
awesome awesome

410
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,159
ok and then the final one

411
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:43,390
and the final one and hopefully you
don't hate me for this one title of the

412
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,400
the thing itself

413
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:52,090
we don't want any can't say no we as a
security community are supposed to be

414
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,370
the gatekeepers for a lot of this stuff
and feature and function first we say no

415
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:04,719
that's bad but at the same time we have
a real hard time saying don't do that

416
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,190
right

417
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,900
and sometimes we succeed I won't
sometimes we succeed but in the general

418
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,770
case

419
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,050
how often do we have to say oh it's okay
what we'll find a way to make it work

420
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:23,440
right and I think that that is really a
facilitator for the bad guys succeeding

421
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,940
we've given them their openings and
they've exploited it and they know that

422
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,850
they have openings that we give them in
the future and they're going to exploit

423
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:38,199
those two because god I can't do the
holistic part of the job that I say I

424
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,180
want to do and i can't get the political
will behind me to actually achieve that

425
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,860
and let's face it if i go into a cut-up
customer and I do that they have the

426
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,550
same problems I don't know how many
people have you done a pen test and

427
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,389
sorry i cant remediate so it's a it's a
problem I just can't fix that right

428
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,920
anyways ok so great

429
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,370
i'm going to do a little little exercise
here right

430
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,760
it's on the concept of no means now now
I have two kids

431
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,129
my youngest will my wife and I had 11
years ago

432
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,770
great my second one was adopted and I
say was adopted not is adopted option is

433
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,840
a process is a beginning and an end

434
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,139
someone is not adopted forever ago since
the name of the process so he is not an

435
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,880
adopted son he's my son

436
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,030
so i have to say it as a top of their
right

437
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,510
ok having said that and having my
lanyard come off here

438
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:39,610
I one of the things that they taught us
in adoption class and yes you have to go

439
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,959
to class because he was from China
specifically taiwan

440
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:50,200
ah is up he's not Caucasian I'm occasion
right no expectation

441
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,890
he's not that means we have a
transracial adoption and part of that

442
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,780
they set us in a room and wanted to
teach us about racism because being

443
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,100
Caucasian

444
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,320
I don't understand it and I thought I
did my best friend growing up were you

445
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,909
name it across the racial boundaries and
because they were my best friends i got

446
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,450
white washed with some of the some of
what they got and I thought I knew what

447
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,080
the hell is doing it trust me i don't
mean to this day I don't

448
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,389
so for all you people who experienced it
I don't understand it but I know it's I

449
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,440
know it's a thing

450
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,400
so what they did is they put us in the
room and they said we want to teach you

451
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,870
that everyone is a racist and well I
took god no I'm not

452
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,780
look I can't this ahead that can't
possibly be by the end of the exercise

453
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,510
every single person in the room was
standing and basically what they did to

454
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:44,050
put things up on the screen said have
you ever and all those things eventually

455
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:48,790
everyone had done it and it was a
culturally ingrained thing that our

456
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,620
parents taught us that we are there we
learned on the news whatever and it was

457
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,719
racist to a degree

458
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,660
now i'm not going to take and teachers
about racism here but I teach about

459
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,710
security for seconds want to do on the
slides I'm going to put up quotes things

460
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,220
that I have said in the past at various
points in time trying to do security

461
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,179
right

462
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:14,740
and if you have ever said something like
that

463
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,779
I want you to stand up let's see how
good we are about saying no in this

464
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:20,950
process here

465
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,860
let's start off it's a medium
vulnerability will d prioritize how many

466
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,658
people have have d prioritize were
mediating a medium brought priority and

467
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:41,230
no one stands up you're all lying right
we'll run the software even if the

468
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,389
vendor can't patch

469
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:46,508
how many of you guys have done that
right

470
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,590
yeah everyone's looking down at their
feet yeah I get it yeah

471
00:32:50,590 --> 00:33:00,158
huh I'm not suggesting otherwise i'm
suggesting we can't say no and I'm not

472
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,970
defending it or saying it but we can't
say no by the way you notice I'm

473
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,539
standing because I've said all these
things that thing you're a senior

474
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:10,658
executive of course you can

475
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:16,269
how many people have said that yeah yeah
yeahs people you don't stand up Bob

476
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,769
we know that while I get through here
you're right my character passwords are

477
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:27,190
too complex to remember it's too late to
fix will just push it out

478
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,299
sure the contractors can come through
the air gap so they don't have to come

479
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:37,450
on site i'll let the developer have
access that's a great one

480
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,009
and last one to every firewall in the
world

481
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:47,289
sure you could have an exception to the
ACL to see if your XYZ works and how

482
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:51,100
many people have actually gone back and
remove that over time - let's let's face

483
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,869
it that's that's the reality there

484
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:57,459
and that is I'm not condemning us for
that that's the reality of the situation

485
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,309
we have the pore pressures on there but
the reality is is for whatever reason we

486
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,350
can't say no

487
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:11,739
the way that we want to in this field
and it's our job to say no isn't it

488
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,828
it's our job to disallow things from
happening

489
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:20,079
security is not about sharing security
is not about letting the network go

490
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,369
where it needs to go

491
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,010
security is about saying

492
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,130
you can't connect you can't have this
you can't do that but yet

493
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,060
our situation is is that we have to
allow that to happen

494
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:41,100
now isn't that facilitating the exact
opposite thing that we want it to happen

495
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,779
there's a million two people out there
that want to get into your system and

496
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,830
you just set up

497
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:50,668
oh it's okay and whatever and we all
know it's been testers list of investors

498
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:51,600
in the room

499
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,580
that's the way we break in right yeah ok
so like no you can't read that but what

500
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,049
I'm suggesting is we the information
security community are at least

501
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,610
partially responsible for facilitating
the problem right

502
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,510
if you go back to my very first . they
are human

503
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,440
every time we do something and we do
something to the lack of completeness

504
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,870
what does that do that incentivizes them
to find the way around it

505
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,500
I was at the world's largest insurance
company doing a pen test it from the

506
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,730
internal environment to see how many
ways we could in fact break in nineteen

507
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,850
and during that process

508
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:36,150
there was a virus outbreak it was a
really nice root kit and it hit 19

509
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,680
people in the environment

510
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,000
can you guess what three letters started
for at least the first of those three

511
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,630
letters started each and every one of
those machines and the reason that they

512
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,060
didn't have any protection on their
machine was it interferes and they

513
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,500
passed around the USB stick with that
particular malware on it amongst

514
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,130
themselves

515
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,620
okay so we know that that's facilitating
the problem right

516
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,279
by the way that was not one of the 19
ways I broke in that just happened to be

517
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,700
there

518
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,390
well as they're so

519
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:16,180
or so I say now like I really there

520
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,078
they have the same password for every
database name of the company one

521
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:28,569
um yeah including including the Federal
Reserve database anyways um so anyways

522
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:34,058
having said that is I also believe we
are the only people that can solve the

523
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:38,859
problem that three billion people that
are out there they're not going to help

524
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:43,569
us here that's not their job that's not
their interest NATO care on the people

525
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,670
that are our customers and our clients
and our organizations they do care but

526
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,250
they're looking to us to take and solve
the problem and so we

527
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,859
I believe need to go beyond what we're
doing as a community to take and solve

528
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:00,640
that problem we can only do it as a
community not as individuals

529
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,109
so I have an idea

530
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:14,170
and we'll see how that how the idea of
flies but let's go back two years and

531
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:19,569
revisit number 5 up their number 5 there
which is out of order said we don't

532
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,099
share

533
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:26,740
i SAT with the CTO of a large security
company they're known for their

534
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,220
antivirus firewall sim products and
stuff like that

535
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:37,598
sorry the CT up and he said when i said
hi of threat intelligence

536
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,269
I'd like to take and share our
information let you know what happen

537
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:43,269
mine you know yours will naanum eyes a
little blah blah

538
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,440
that way we can take a better protect
both of our customers that you're at the

539
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,339
desktop on the network perfect marriage
and he said to me

540
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,039
that's why i said to him and he said to
me

541
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:04,059
never going to happen our data is our
differentiator our data it's so unique

542
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:07,750
that we can't possibly give it away
because then we'll never be able to sell

543
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:13,119
a product again and I looked at her and
said well isn't your technology unique

544
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,859
the data just simply supported

545
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,980
he said no our data is unique let's talk
about today

546
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,279
yeah i'm sharing data with them haha

547
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:24,400
and for other vendors who said the same
thing

548
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,359
they're all names you know probably
names you use probably names you sell

549
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:34,598
and maybe some vulnerabilities were
found in their management products

550
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,480
recently but that's that's enough
anyways

551
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,619
and the reason for that is I came to
things like this and i said we need to

552
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,880
share enough people came to the table
and said we need to share now i'm not

553
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,029
the only one that's saying is i'm not
going to claim that i'm the only one

554
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:53,950
doing this is part of much wider thing
out there but it takes is changing the

555
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,069
industry now it's going to take probably
10 years to get to the point where we

556
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:00,099
need to get to but at least it's
starting

557
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,970
and now that blue coat was acquired by
symantec on me get there get a tip

558
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:10,629
anyways the net net is it's happening
there and that was something that was

559
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,589
impossible we can't share it's dangerous
for us to share like no one shares

560
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:15,788
information

561
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:19,029
it's happening so I believe that things
are possible

562
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:26,259
so what if we could do something about
all those other things out there that I

563
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:32,440
talked about how would that change our
world and i have a question for for the

564
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,609
audience here

565
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:36,910
how do you think that that would change
our world of those seven things I'm sure

566
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,649
that's not all of them let's just talk
about those seven things changed to be

567
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,450
positive instead of negatives like that
i perpetrate portrayed them to be that

568
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,930
we did those things that are three
billion users out there in the world

569
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,058
weren't a liability

570
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,670
what if

571
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,480
it wasn't security that's just DIY for
many many cases

572
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:02,430
what if we actually shared what happened
to us so that other people could take

573
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,680
and prevent it from happening to them

574
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,328
how would our world change and I know
that's a fairly tall order but I work

575
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:12,690
for tell Cody I've been told to solve
fairly tall order so you know i'm no

576
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,740
good with that

577
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,689
so what I've done is I've actually
created a manifesto

578
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:23,819
I'm not good at manifesto so I apologize
for that but I've create an investor

579
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:30,779
that says what are the things that we as
a collective whole could do to take and

580
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,440
solve this and I'm going to pull quote
from the game of thrones not know how

581
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,790
many people here watch it

582
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,900
probably were all in the technology
industry so everyone but in the most

583
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,270
recent seasons we have this guy called
the high Sparrow he was well many things

584
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,990
but he had a quote i really believe that
quotes true and we live in a democracy

585
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,879
so i know that it back

586
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:59,250
works as an individual I am powerless
but as a community we can topple an

587
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:04,230
empire right and i think that's the
place we have to go

588
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:09,180
and for the things i'm talking about
here is I'm suggesting and you guys may

589
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,200
say I'm an idiot like I said that you
would at the very beginning here but if

590
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,109
we did those things we did them to
completion

591
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:19,740
it's the possibility for us to change
the trajectory because nothing else we

592
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:24,029
have done has changed the trajectory
right firewalls are magic bullet it's

593
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,230
going to change the trajectory of of bad
guys except in port 80 and 443 but

594
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,460
that's not another story

595
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,809
um you know i'm going to put in an idea
so tell me everything that they're doing

596
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:37,079
he accepted produces too many logs and
we need another thing to seem to

597
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,079
actually read and interpret it and which
of course the output of which we won't

598
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,470
actually pay attention to the you know

599
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,848
and on and on and on and on and on in
fact AV let's they think of it and

600
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:49,650
viruses the first magic bullet

601
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:55,740
i got my first virus in 1989 and oh my
god ad is gonna protect me from all

602
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,700
these things

603
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,549
yeah it's reason to run Mac now anyways
um so let's let's think about that for a

604
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:03,210
second

605
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,600
what could that possibly be and again

606
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:12,259
that's the things that I thought of and
I might not be right but I think those

607
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,050
are starting points and you say well
that's all

608
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:21,800
difficult and hard to achieve and then I
say yes but in 1992

609
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,340
when I first started working people
smoked at their desk

610
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,799
they smoked at their desk in fact i own
a partner's that's from booz allen

611
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,640
hamilton where I worked that has
cigarette burn marks in it for me

612
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,379
smoking it in the office

613
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:42,320
Steve Griffis anyways by the way really
nice by the way that we fast forward to

614
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,010
today

615
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,040
people said no we don't want this and
for all you smokers where do we have to

616
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,279
smoke we have to go outside in the
especially here in the northern states

617
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,180
were cold and wet and sticky to do my
smoking and you want it in other

618
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:58,580
countries to write Japan they're smoking
outside and England were outside the pub

619
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,759
it's changing and those things can
change the world

620
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,880
that should never have changed
twenty-five percent of the world's

621
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,630
smokes

622
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,930
they should stop that shit but they
didn't write

623
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,160
I also think this is the way that we go
about it and we have to do it as a

624
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,149
community we can't do it as individuals
as individuals is not going to work for

625
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:22,460
us so we take a look at that we have to
start viewing our adversaries there's

626
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,050
humans right

627
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,320
what is their natural progression
they're in it for the money right why do

628
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,050
it if it's not for the money well maybe
to find the games the political activism

629
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,970
but really in it for the money

630
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,410
all right let's start treating them as
people that are in it for the money that

631
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:42,680
everything we do they're going to be
reactive - I'm you know enforce a simple

632
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,040
common baseline what is our password
standard i'll give you the first one we

633
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,250
can start on actually get rid of
password so that's another story

634
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,440
um share what the hell happened to us

635
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,750
it's only scary until everyone starts
doing it and if everyone scary it's it's

636
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,380
actually pretty good back i'm a big
proponent of getting rid of network

637
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,700
security entirely

638
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,169
let's move it all down to the device
let's do it at the device level it's not

639
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,860
doing the network the network is
blinding us to solving problems inside

640
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,800
our facilities because the network's
care of it

641
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,600
it doesn't for many sitting through the
one um move away by security by

642
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,560
happenstance

643
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,610
the term best practice means it's
optional right

644
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,090
best practice means it's optional hey
they're doing its best practices and

645
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,570
required practice or whatever you want
to call it right out there

646
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,220
let's actually get central references
that our technology photo and I think

647
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,919
grandmother's really should be my
mother-in-law my grandmother's dead

648
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,420
she can't read anything but my
mother-in-law you can actually do and

649
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,350
you know

650
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,450
published mechanisms to assist having
the bad guys arrested

651
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,530
wouldn't it be great if we could give
the information to actually have these

652
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:58,280
guys removed from our problem maybe that
creates a worse problem i don't know but

653
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,600
we haven't tried it

654
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,210
all right we have no mechanism for doing
that and then lastly and the title of

655
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:10,400
the entire thing is stopped accepting
compromise on security and we have to do

656
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,610
it as a universal thing and if we did it
as a universal guideline out there we

657
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,000
are then supported when people say no no
I wanted to

658
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,110
sorry i have to say no it's a universal
guideline right we don't have that and

659
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,830
that's what we're gonna go back to that
central reference . we have nothing to

660
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,490
say

661
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,209
this is the way you do it and so no one
believes you

662
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,270
right you have to bring in external pen
testers but your internal security

663
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,640
people can't be trusted

664
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:43,220
really really on which by the way is
good for business but that's beside the

665
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,700
point

666
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,379
you know let's take and change how we do
this by the way if you want to copy this

667
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,330
i'm happy to give it to you don't have
to write it down

668
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,290
but mom so that's it

669
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,190
and how much time do I have here oh look
at that

670
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,220
I got five minutes I got five minutes

671
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:11,480
so no pack up to look like we read my
words and say things about them

672
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:24,530
yeah yeah I disagree with that

673
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,919
I disagree with that because I'm doing
it i went from zero to millions on

674
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,920
things and i'm not saying for everything
but yes go ahead

675
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:47,630
Yeah Yeah right

676
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,970
and I will agree with you there

677
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,970
I will great

678
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:26,000
father misspelled it

679
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,090
oh my god is not it I'm an idiot

680
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:47,570
well but let's i agree with that

681
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,430
hundred percent because i have a global
remit so I have unfortunately this

682
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:57,740
problem help elsewhere but yeah we have
problems in Russia we have problems in

683
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,720
China but does that obviate the need for
us to get rid of problems in the United

684
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,359
States for an England or whatever

685
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,359
yeah

686
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:41,000
yep we're really because I get three
times today

687
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,350
so I agree and these are propositions
these aren't definitive statements and

688
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,990
i'm not saying that every one of these
is perfect but change it change it to

689
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,100
make it work

690
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:21,700
yep yep yep and I'm not refusing
anything you set by the way I great

691
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,419
completely is these are not set in stone
these are ideas

692
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:30,250
let's talk about the mess community
let's decide what we want to do about

693
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,810
them let's throw some away

694
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,890
I'm fail fast I'm a I'm an agile
environment throw it away i don't care

695
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:44,980
I'm sorry with who no but I've talked
with the FBI in the as trillions

696
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:53,470
so okay so by the way for that
particular one is actually on staff i

697
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,399
actually have people who are former
Secret Service people who are in fact

698
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,820
the current head of a cyber crime in
Australia so we as an organization are

699
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,280
ruffling how to take and do this

700
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,520
we like to take and publish things out
there to the community

701
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,060
so we're trying to find a way to do it
with the people we have on staff who are

702
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,529
part of that community

703
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:20,440
so as a concept you know I also believe
in doing things locally as well as

704
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,310
globally

705
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,480
I put this out to you but that's because
many of these things we're trying to do

706
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,760
some degree ourselves

707
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,940
I can't solve everything in the world
but I can certainly try down the path

708
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,230
and find out what works

709
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,160
so by the way and the reason I say
throughout passwords i have an

710
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,930
alternative that may be better but I
also recognize that writing a password

711
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,930
function is about 10 lines of code so

712
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:50,320
are writing at wells about a thousand so
yeah some other questions comments and

713
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,320
or derogatory remarks

714
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,750
none enough that that's the way I end
all my presentations and it's actually

715
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,820
written two slides from now

716
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:08,109
yep yep yep

717
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:12,279
and that's the point that I'm making is
that is realistically saying no is a

718
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:18,849
very high high task and the reason i
said is we need a reference out there is

719
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:22,869
because you have nothing to back you up
right there is political will there's

720
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:26,710
commercial there's all thousands of
things that we have out there that

721
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,930
disallow us from saying no but if we
have something greater than ourselves

722
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:38,470
that says for these things you should
say no you begin to form an ability to

723
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,910
do that now

724
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,890
we'll help you immediately probably not
but as those sort of things are out

725
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:45,970
there

726
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,169
they tend to be references the more that
their references the more power you have

727
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,390
to use them as references and so forth

728
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,299
there is nothing in a particular
environment for me to take an override

729
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:01,540
your CEOs but the requirement but the
CEO is responsible to a board board is

730
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,540
responsible for reading things and so
forth and that's where i've been

731
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,339
successful in doing things

732
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:10,150
yes I think you just touched on that a
little said will this change things

733
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,170
immediately

734
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,570
now

735
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:15,570
yep

736
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:25,530
haha good point good point yep yep yep

737
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:33,060
yeah and we we do as community so i
don't know how i'm doing on time here

738
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:40,020
ok so people want to move their people
here to kick me out so anything else

739
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,100
from the floor

740
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:47,130
you're all talking so that means I've
lost you anyway so thank you very much

741
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,130
appreciate your time

742
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,430
yeah
