1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
okay are we ready to go check check

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,640
everybody well Josh blog of Mars and he
could speak about the back

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,510
I thank you for the introduction

4
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,090
that's how everybody my name is Joshua
Clark I work with the check marks

5
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,870
we are you how many folks have heard of
check marks

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,840
ok maybe a third of the room ok so what
check marks is just a quick and short as

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,149
Clark checkmarks you basically we build
products first static application

8
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,449
security analysis what we do is were
basically code analysis

9
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,949
static code analysis we never basically
an engine that scans numerous

10
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,239
programming languages

11
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,980
how we support many different platforms
and we'll be talking about some of that

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,320
today but the purpose of my talk today
is I'm sure some of you guys are

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,979
probably interested in the the plan
words here because this is a very

14
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,299
familiar with Game of Thrones and
hopefully everybody right so that's

15
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,540
that's kind of the the title that we use
here to kind of get the get the interest

16
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,990
and hence the honey pot thing that we
basically built to get people to come to

17
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,390
our site that gather interest

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,750
so just a quick a quick briefing on me
and my background I've spent

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,919
I like to go i don't really have a title
check marks that kind of just make it up

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,280
as I go but I like to come up with this
one today jack of all hacks masters

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,700
nothing

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,689
many people say jack of all trades
master number i do all kinds of hacking

23
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,220
a both black hat the black packing a
white hat in grey hat that the whole the

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,600
whole gamut over my short career in the
industry i probably spent about five

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,419
years building stuff in the last five
and a half six years

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,159
breaking stuff so I got you no
experience in both sides in the last

27
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,600
five years I've worked for a bunch of
big companies HP IBM i'm working with

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
checkmarks work with all many of
different tools both in the

29
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,860
we'll call it the black box tools and
white box tools

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,080
- sassed grass below the whole the whole
gamut and what I'm here to talk to you

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,200
today about is a game of hacks the
monitor the mother of all honey pots and

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,609
basically what we're going to talk about
today i'll give you the quick agenda

33
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm basically how we're going to spend
our time over the next 45 minutes

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,610
typically how you like to do talks five
minutes on a quick intro overview spent

35
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,420
about 20 30 minutes of content and 10
minutes for questions people he said .

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,559
questions at the end and basically this
is the agenda we're going to talk about

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,120
what is game hacks

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,420
what was the purpose of game of hacks

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,410
what was behind it you know why we how
we came up with this and where we you

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,170
know how we how we came up that the
third point here

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,470
i'm sorry i'm just going to tell me real
quick okay

42
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:13,799
were you ever now and ok alright thanks

43
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:21,120
so on now go ahead I like that yes and
no background music for all I just like

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,430
listen to myself talking just you know
that puts me at ease

45
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,700
ok so back to the agenda here at third
part of we come over and not so wet a

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
typical we have it

47
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,890
you know where my venue will do it wet
t-shirt contest yeah I like those those

48
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,410
types of events but anyways we're gonna
have a not so wet t-shirt contest for

49
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,049
all you folks in here so we have a
little contest we have to pay attention

50
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,140
you can't sleep I don't know anybody you
know make sure you do have your mobile

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,708
phones and your laptop's because there's
going to be interactive session

52
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,440
it's not going to be a typical one right
to sleep here in lecture you're actually

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,070
be interacting and answering some
questions so pay attention all the

54
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,630
slides that you know

55
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,109
pay attention keep going to have a quiz
throughout and it'll be pretty pretty

56
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,620
fun and then once we get through our
little contest they also have a given

57
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,700
giveaway so I have a surprise appeared
whoever has the high score gets a prize

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,238
and then after we get through the
contest

59
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,048
we're actually going to get into some
some more content with no Jas so

60
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,649
potential risks with the node.js
platform how many of you know about no

61
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,399
Jess

62
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,919
ok like six to eight people raise their
hands okay well according to this talk

63
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,030
it will is about no Jess so if you don't
know i'm going to explain what no Jas is

64
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,299
kind of give you the what's what and
who's who got no Jess so you can

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,530
actually learn about it and understand
it so security implications and why you

66
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,489
should care about the platform and then
finally we'll just talk about some quick

67
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,919
take away and leave the rest for some
Q&A

68
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:53,130
ok alright so interesting slide that we
have here take a quick look at it

69
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,620
this also is kind of interesting because
today is we're doing the you know we

70
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,590
have the lobby we have the vendors from
the vendor space

71
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,510
I know some of the attendees come up and
look at the the board that we have set

72
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,020
up there it's very similar to just a
different different code snippets but

73
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,950
it's different

74
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,680
basically same thing folks come up and
they look at the code and they sit there

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,810
and they ponder and they go boom

76
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,680
what was that one ability or you know
what is that what is that code that's

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,340
basically how this is the idea came
about a few my colleagues attend

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,580
attended a black hat and they had walked
up to a booth and they saw some code on

79
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,609
up on a board and said they were
pondering you know what what's wrong

80
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,550
with this code or what security
implications other in this code

81
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,640
how many of you guys have attended a
black hat or def con conference

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,570
some couples okay well that's kinda like
the the industry staple of your

83
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,180
insecurities like black hats kind of
like that

84
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,530
the de facto standard for for security
conferences held in Las Vegas every year

85
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,159
think it's coming up in the next month
so if you're interested try to try to go

86
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,419
out there and check it out

87
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,430
but anyways that's where this idea came
from basically and also if you ever see

88
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,860
a lot of times you go to these
conferences people's shirts

89
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,219
where they have like different times of
light snow everywhere like binary or so

90
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,760
we have some code under sure we actually
have some teachers that we give away you

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,630
attend the conference some of those
t-shirts that have code no code elements

92
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,419
that basically try to debug or try to
figure out what the security

93
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,930
vulnerabilities and source code so
that's basically how this came about and

94
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,820
so taking that idea

95
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,460
taking a step forward basically what we
decided to do with this

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,460
this idea of grabbing source code was
too

97
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,890
I mean with that idea in mind the other
the other big concept here is how many

98
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,419
of you are familiar with us

99
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,070
ok so many of your mother's ok so you're
familiar with the wasp as you know

100
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,760
there's typically serve as they they've
given out and over the course of time

101
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,770
basically these surveys event told the
couple things one of the most important

102
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:55,620
things with respect to application
security is that basically what it comes

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,650
down to is security awareness for
developers

104
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,669
so there was a survey that was sent out
basically two different to see sales

105
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,150
across all different industries and
basically the net of it was that

106
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,289
developers are just you know they're
they're not really security folks they

107
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,110
don't really have any security awareness
they don't typically get security

108
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,550
training and that's basically the whole
kind of made the major point here about

109
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,510
around this whole game of hacks
illustration in the demonstration is

110
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,460
that developers

111
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,840
you know the primary use case primary
thing that developers with most focusing

112
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,590
on and I can attest this case to be a
developer was I was writing functional

113
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,109
code i just want to write some code get
it to work

114
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,740
push it and ship it out I wasn't really
focused on i mean when i first started

115
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,190
writing writing code I didn't really
have a clue about and what sequel

116
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,120
injection what's cross-site scripting
what's HTTP response splitting you know

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,560
what what are these concentrated no
clothes and I grab some code of ok i

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,530
guess you get some background background
music for ya

119
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,119
anyways a long story short here the
whole bed of this is that developers

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,810
typically are trained on security
concepts

121
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,210
typically they learn how to learn a
programming language in the University

122
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,280
and you know go to university learn how
to do coding learn how to write some

123
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,179
application code talk to me and pull
some data from a web behind on the web

124
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,870
page and then you put that into a
database and you know click on the forum

125
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,610
button right some JavaScript and

126
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,389
go on to the next piece of code there is
really no cutting no no

127
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,289
we'll talk about security and it's it's
it's more it's more prevalent today

128
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,389
because every day you know on the news

129
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,329
there's a new hack it comes out of me
that's kind of why we're all here to

130
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,708
learn about and security topics and
whatnot so it's kind of finish up here

131
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,039
with this point about game of hacks in
the honey pot you know this is this is

132
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,120
another big piece of piece of it is that
also with this this concept that we come

133
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,230
up with is that you can use it as an
educational tool right

134
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,519
so think about your own organization for
a minute you have your organization you

135
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,000
guys all have domain specific code right
if you're working in healthcare and

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,940
healthcare domain specific code you work
in government you might have domain

137
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,899
specific code you can use it as a tool
for the concepts that we have here with

138
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,950
a map packs and his honey pot too kind
of train your developers in the code

139
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,360
that you have a particular maybe
particular of problems that you find you

140
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,899
know over and over in your code and
train your own team of developers on how

141
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:23,279
to write better code and so right now if
you want you can actually go out to on

142
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,750
your mobile device on your laptop if you
want you can go out and go to a game of

143
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,980
hacks com

144
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,350
and what you'll see is you actually go
to our website you know we own the

145
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,000
domain and we basically we launched this
in august of 2014

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,959
and since then we had about I mean to
this date I just check the stats

147
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,640
yesterday we got about a hundred twenty
thousand i heard her and 20,000

148
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,170
participants people that have actually
logged on ran through it and actually

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,290
tried to you know sit go through the
question because basically what it does

150
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,540
I'm actually just show it for everybody
so if they don't have their machine up

151
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:06,000
i'll go ahead and just sit here so

152
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:14,640
you - Jessica space well I'll display
here we are - place you can see it

153
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,900
so you should be able to see my screen
here

154
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,499
so game of

155
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,739
max see how good you are you can go in
there you can play single player you can

156
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:29,999
challenge your friend and basically what
you are able to do here with gamefaqs

157
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:34,559
click single player you can pick your
your difficulty level you can pick

158
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,889
whether you think you're a beginner
intermediate or advanced and they can go

159
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,379
out there and for example you know Sam
start playing and go out go out now

160
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,929
start the game up and it's going to ask
you some code SQ would security run a

161
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:53,879
business in this code block and you have
to go out there and answer it and that's

162
00:10:53,879 --> 00:11:00,179
essentially what are you know what our
whole you know this whole talk is going

163
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,459
to basically be about as a demonstration
of this

164
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:08,518
okay so me go back here to the
presentation him just to kind of talk

165
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,329
about

166
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,228
we're going to go a little bit deeper
than just with the game covers but the

167
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:17,129
net of it is not only do we get a
hundred twenty participants but in doing

168
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:21,359
that we also did something else anybody
else see what else we did with with

169
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:25,019
setting up a site like this and and kind
of doing something like this any other

170
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,869
ideas that you could think of in the
title of the talk so title

171
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,358
honey pop right getting people to come
to the site and getting them to you know

172
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:39,419
getting them submit their information
basically collecting you know trying to

173
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,579
get people to come to our site and get
information from them get them to upload

174
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:50,909
their information to our website some
other statistics about our game of hacks

175
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:54,929
website was not only do we get over a
hundred twenty thousand users to our

176
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:55,858
website

177
00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:02,429
we also got over 500 code submissions
right of different code fragments from

178
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:06,089
different teams and different variations
think about that's basically like free

179
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:10,889
you know now also if you think about our
business right we're doing code analysis

180
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,199
right want to see different types of
code

181
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,829
we just got 500 or like 500 three
different types of code snippets across

182
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:20,159
multiple different languages and which
could or could not have security

183
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,849
vulnerabilities in them so kind of like
free security testing uh just by setting

184
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:28,079
up a honey products think about it and
then also a total amount of games played

185
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,248
is over we had over a hundred twenty
thousand unique visitors and over 200

186
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:38,128
30 thousand games played so people
definitely been utilizing our our site

187
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,289
and kind of playing around

188
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:47,489
so pretty cool stuff there with game
hacks and so again just to kind of talk

189
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:52,289
about those kind of key elements behind
game of hacks and kind of what it was

190
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,910
was meant to do

191
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,289
there's a bigger the number one thing
here with the with being that it was a

192
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:03,149
honey pot was that we also went out
there and Google into some particular

193
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,470
hacker forums and just like with
anything if you know any of the

194
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,389
different type of hacker forms that out
there

195
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,929
the folks that were playing the game
we're actually talking about it right

196
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,749
so they were actually out there
commenting about different types of

197
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,589
vulnerabilities they were finding within
the game now we knew about that

198
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,919
you know setting it up we did that
intentionally alright so we knew people

199
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,319
going to try to hack just that's the
kind of the whole game the whole purpose

200
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:28,498
of doing a honeypot to kind of set
people up that you know they're going to

201
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,919
try to hack you and then you try to try
to hack them or try to capture the

202
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,029
information and so as you can see here
some of the comments here from this

203
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:41,100
this gentleman he basically put on your
and said hey you know it tries to teach

204
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,829
security but it fails that security
because it has no basically has a

205
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:44,998
vulnerability in it

206
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:48,329
and ironically the you know the game is
easy to hack

207
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:55,349
he is an easy game to hack about finding
and security bugs and basically we have

208
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,269
like that we assume the game would be
hacked

209
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,899
we might as well learn from it learn
from what what folks are going to do it

210
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,109
because we were rebuilt this the
platform that we built it on

211
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,569
i was <day> second </day> at the time
when this came out was it was around to

212
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:11,909
the new platform which is no Jas I had a
mongo show you the architecture here and

213
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:16,139
also the vulnerabilities that we found
from the the users that were hacking are

214
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:22,319
basically hacking her honeypot basically
use those to enhance our product right

215
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,469
because we have a code scanner product
and this is kind of with things that you

216
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,100
didn't

217
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,819
if you look here basically it's a
client-server architecture you log into

218
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,799
a browser or mobile device

219
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,949
you hit the the know Jas front end

220
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:40,319
basically it's a server sitting on a
Roco instance with the MongoDB database

221
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,929
basically people log in you place a
single player or you can share code as

222
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,100
it said in the beginning

223
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,929
basically that's kind of the
architecture of what we set up for this

224
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:58,199
impacts game basically once you login
you know I did you say i can show you

225
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,878
some of this already but basically talks
about getting the score level the type

226
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,509
of question that you have more than one
of the answers and then you get the code

227
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,589
snippet and then you get to you can get
to . and kind of play against your

228
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,909
friends so typically don't know how many
of you guys used to be developers for

229
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:16,019
our developers

230
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:21,449
ok maybe a couple or used to be mostly
developers are kind of like eating

231
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,909
I'm just saying I i know i would kind of
wasn't as a developer I always wanted to

232
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:26,909
be you know compete with other
developers so it's kind of a lot of

233
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,980
developers and they play this game you
know they want to compete against each

234
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,579
other so that's kind of why make a game
and then they compete and then you kind

235
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,039
of the best guy win so it's kind of fun

236
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,559
I mean that's that's kind of the whole
essence I think that's why this headset

237
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,819
so was so successful when we created it
because developers always want to know

238
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,749
so every developer wants to be the the
best in the developer within your team

239
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:51,600
so it's a kind of interesting in that
regard so so we actually play another

240
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,029
game that I haven't told you about yet

241
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,269
so I do want you guys to get your
devices

242
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:02,909
what if you have phone got your phone
your mobile device or iPad or you know

243
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:06,449
whatever whatever kind of ice you have I
want you to go to a website this website

244
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:10,019
here called dub dub dub

245
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,229
Kahoot that I tea ok

246
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,180
I want you

247
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:32,140
there you're going to need to enter a
code now once this loads up here

248
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:50,279
go ahead and do player versus player see
it started here so that

249
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,819
pin so once you go ahead and punch that
when you go to complete an IT punching

250
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,878
that a hat pin code and it was going to
ask you to put in the username

251
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:03,509
now put in something relatively unique
to yourself to your nickname or whatever

252
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:21,419
we come up with something uh something
interesting got 10 players 12 13

253
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,569
remember there's a prize you participate
and you do happen to win

254
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:33,059
there's a price so more more the merrier
here will give it a look at it

255
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,730
excuse me I can't hear you saying

256
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:45,000
yeah yeah - yeah yeah go ahead and login
we're going honey pot you steal your

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,230
credit dr. device

258
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,970
huh we'll give it another minute here
and then we'll go ahead and start the

259
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,179
game and you can you cannot just
remember the pin

260
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,179
that's the pin to join

261
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,770
ok yeah this is this is a funny little I
great gap video here in the back this

262
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,030
dam is go if it just keeps going on and
kick any other goats it's pretty funny

263
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,809
all right let's go ahead and just play
this game here so we'll start this guy

264
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:13,770
up

265
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,490
there's ten questions

266
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,260
ok so basically you got 10 seconds to
answer

267
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,950
so go ahead and go off and uh the answer
to start popping over here as people go

268
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,730
through

269
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,130
ok so we had all right so some people
are comfortable this is it was just a

270
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,520
question just to see if if you are
comfortable in your seat

271
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,639
ok so we gotta go to get you get seven
small ok you guys still see all right

272
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,240
great

273
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,380
so it's just a sample questions and
hopefully a suggest you get it right

274
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,429
all right let's go ahead question number
two

275
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:03,840
this is just a test to make sure that
you guys are all pretty smart here

276
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,530
all right great

277
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,428
everybody got that right so - I promised
the other ones are going to be actually

278
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:20,159
hear about security is going to be math
problems for you want to become so we

279
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,470
can also see who's in the right that's
the picture and then you're here

280
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,470
let's go to the next question

281
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,539
alright so using the original leave here
cool chain saws all right we got mac aod

282
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,379
hey

283
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,539
alright so here we go now what your
vulnerability is exposed in this code

284
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:43,679
block is probably can't see it

285
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:55,980
well I guess we can't can't blow it up
anymore but uh for those of you that can

286
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,980
see it see it on your phone

287
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,740
can't do much with the the imager

288
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:13,679
cool

289
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,389
so how many you guys got a right for all
right so yeah basically

290
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,469
the problem with this one we look at the
code here

291
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,980
basically we have a response here that
we pull in or basically pulling the

292
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,590
request and we use that to build
basically do a basically a uncontrolled

293
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,689
format string in this case

294
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,820
so again you validate input in this case
but pretty straightforward here

295
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:48,750
all right let's go to the next one so
hey you're you're in the lead

296
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:55,590
all right another code problem hopefully
this images bigger to you since it or

297
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,090
you can be able to see it in your phone

298
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,490
you're playing phone all right basically
deaf read file reader request in and

299
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,059
take that then we have another method
here called are not object request we

300
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:11,490
have the response and then you say
request I get read that file then

301
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,000
finally open a file loop over it you
write some stuff out

302
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
what can we do here

303
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,549
path traversal so six you guys got it
right

304
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,570
all right guys are you doing okay

305
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,870
I don't know we'll see who's using the
leader hey hey still up there so we'll

306
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,959
find out who that is hoping that they
they wind up with it

307
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,600
all right next one here's a chance for
extra points for those folks that have

308
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,520
been happy to get the code once right

309
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,139
yeah it was pretty easy this one you got
a system that you got a 50-50 shot on

310
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,950
this one

311
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,950
so hopefully uh so we can get this right

312
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:07,240
there you go ok so i guess somebody in
fact it

313
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,990
so you guys didn't watch them and Jerry
when you guys were kids but that's okay

314
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,030
how the cat is is Tom just so just so
you know I couldn't watch some some

315
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,299
loony tunes and saturday morning or to
revisit that one

316
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,590
he's having he's having fun anybody
having fun yet

317
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,918
yeah ok cool right ok yeah so hopefully
it's more fun than somebody stuck but

318
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,460
alright next one here back to that oh
hey you're still on top

319
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,220
the only up and top by 40 points self so
eltron yeah it was 40

320
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,490
okay you're close yep alrighty l-tron
let's see if you can do it got four more

321
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,830
left here what vulnerability is exposed
in this code you have a PHP block here

322
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,449
to start a session you check to see if
some values are set and we go file DB

323
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,940
new PDO do a prepared statement we
inserted basically do prepared statement

324
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,970
insert into an object we do some
parameter binding

325
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:19,330
who most yes I thought that was sequel
injection

326
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,470
no there's binding that's being done so
it's not a problem with that it's a

327
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,900
problem with cross-site request forgery

328
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,730
how do you guys know a cross-site
request forgery is ok I guess only four

329
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,110
people per day something that hurts
there for people are just lucky

330
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,928
but anyways basically what cross-site
request forgery is it's a little harder

331
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,290
to determine basically there's an
operation that securing but it could be

332
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,668
occurring on the perhaps you could get
you could get somebody else to execute

333
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:49,630
that on be on your behalf so say i'm
logged in in my session and I click on a

334
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,600
link and i execute an activity

335
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,889
somebody sent me a link and i execute an
activity I'm not they get me to do

336
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,270
something on my behalf that I'm not
supposed to do so basically getting you

337
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,070
to do something and when i'm logged in

338
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,980
in this case that's what that will do is
create do to make it basically making

339
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,460
some kind of data operation on behalf of
someone else

340
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,669
ok l-tron hey you got kicked off the top

341
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:20,799
Ultron's the pop only by three points
though this is getting close

342
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,668
all right here next year so question 7

343
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:28,510
so here's one question think about the
game that we're playing right now right

344
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:36,100
client-server what limitation might we
run into if the client randomizes the

345
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
answer order for example these answer
orders

346
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,100
what's what's impossible it's a possible
problem with this one

347
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,190
somebody was asking about background
music I think we got it

348
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,590
the game so yes this is up you guys a
seven you guys get this right that's

349
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,280
good

350
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,780
basically this one the server won't know
which ones they wrote the correct answer

351
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,080
in that case the client does a even
randomizing

352
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,090
the order of the answers ok I'll try
yours

353
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,750
you're still top have you got a pretty
good lead oh oh oh yeah that I come up

354
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,809
alright so in this case who should be
validating answer correctness client or

355
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,850
the server

356
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,299
this should be it again 50-50 shot on
this one

357
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:28,600
trying to give you guys a quick easy for
you here

358
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,219
so again and in the concept of this game
right

359
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,220
this concept of this game we're playing
here right so the unlucky person here

360
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,220
that pic the client it's not the clients
the service service service should

361
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,730
always be validating which example the
server knows which answer is correct so

362
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,029
it's you know how to validate which
answer is correct

363
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:52,840
ok cpus process for that

364
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,019
that's better alright so I'll turns up
there your mom is getting up there is

365
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:56,980
getting close

366
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,659
all right hey you back in your clothes
get two more left

367
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:05,889
now what is the problem here with no Jas
this no Jess could not only a couple of

368
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:09,939
you know no jazz so this might be a
little bit more difficult but it's

369
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,490
pretty simple code base here it's just a
job

370
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,840
ap eyes are you know it's basically this
could be any language doesn't have to be

371
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,840
no chance to Java C sharp jump anything

372
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:33,100
ok so the problem here with that code
block was that the client can answer the

373
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,799
same question multiple times

374
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,760
basically it's if you have that image
here right so user response is a

375
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
response to save him there's no way for
it to know

376
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,250
in that case which which one is the the
right answer

377
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,880
ok so let's go back here we got one more
left see see who's a so hey you're still

378
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,110
the top I'll try on your clothes your
mom you're only about a hundred less

379
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,629
than hundred points off so you have a
chance here the last one

380
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,440
all right drum roll but over all right
let's do it

381
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,050
so last one here which item in the score
calculation and the formula do you think

382
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,880
while based on the hackers that were
packing our money pot which cut which

383
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
value do you think they were able to
hack the quickest

384
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,170
my guess is 60

385
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:41,370
alright so

386
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,380
ok let me you guys got a right it's good
yeah basically in this one

387
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,300
yeah that the client can can modify the
the time to answer they can basically

388
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,110
modify that value on the client and
change the value they were able to

389
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,740
basically specify a value i'll show you
this here in a minute let's see who our

390
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,700
winner is

391
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:08,190
hey hey you okay so who's hey how there
you go hard so I got a surprise for you

392
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,410
ready for this awesome price

393
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,530
ok you have just received

394
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll hub USB hub now we can give them a
positive

395
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:27,499
so any of you guys all the other losers
in the room if you guys want to stop by

396
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,980
the booth after you come by and get a
free a USB drive for your participation

397
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,600
in today's game

398
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,748
so thank you very much for playing that
was a somewhat fun and enjoy it so yeah

399
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:39,950
thank you for playing here

400
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,100
this is this is a fun little game you
can also use this for young

401
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,459
if you're interested up i find to be
pretty a pretty useful little game here

402
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,100
we doing presentations but any go

403
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:57,469
the code that i provide early the pin
that I've tried it

404
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,809
um so yeah the code in game hacks we
don't provide that that's not provided

405
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:07,789
but the would you asking about the
desert code rocker

406
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,259
yeah you can use that pin but that's
only gonna let you ever play that game

407
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:19,669
so you can you play the game a bunch of
times if you want but you know who I t

408
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:23,480
is that so it's this little site that
allows you to create create your own

409
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,200
games but anyways game hacks a lot of a
lot of cool value here with this but

410
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
let's get back to the presentation here
see we're doing there now

411
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:36,139
ok cool we got about 20 minutes left
with you get so let's take a look here

412
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:39,760
at a just kind of

413
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,080
back to some of the elements of of
answered questions so initially users a

414
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,639
initiated

415
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,840
basically what with this gentleman here
that the guy that uh basically hacked

416
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,770
your application with the the answer
question elements basically allowed them

417
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,879
to submit the answer multiple times
until they get so if you had enough if

418
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,380
you have any other hand the timer

419
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,740
basically what you could do is if you
ran basically a script in your browser

420
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,720
app that send answers

421
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,100
you could send the answer multiple times
to the server and it would it would you

422
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,629
can do it until you got it right

423
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,840
so you can just go right a little quick
loop and say submit all the answers

424
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,379
you got the right one enough time you
can do that in the JavaScript console

425
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,400
window in the browser and I get the
answer because we didn't have a flag on

426
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,940
the server side to say hey this question
is already been answered

427
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,120
right you can keep submitting the answer
until you get it right

428
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,989
we didn't have a flag and the code to
prevent that so that's the solution is

429
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,980
to prevent that right actually have a
flag that's just kind of more of a not

430
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,820
really a security I mean it's not really
security she's more of a functional and

431
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,040
if you're creating a game engine you
probably want to have a flag in there

432
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,350
and say hey to answer is already been
the questions have been answered

433
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,560
don't let them answer again that's one
one piece

434
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,270
the other available component here game
hacks in RM - these are also specific to

435
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:02,230
our our game of hacks that we that we
created was also the timer so the first

436
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,090
version we let that the timer was
handled by the client so the client said

437
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,040
code that was executing was basically
that answer plus the time spent to the

438
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,850
server

439
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,310
so any you know militia any no hacker
that Daniel was installed there could

440
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,790
have actually went out and just change
the value to extend the time

441
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,020
right so the time time spent could have
you basically just change that value to

442
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,639
a big number and then they could have

443
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,150
take as much time as they want to try to
figure out them the question

444
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:39,120
right and that's basically be able to do
that by modifying that the JavaScript on

445
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,300
the client side and then again our
friends and the hacker forms decided to

446
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,440
you know like that I didn't get to think
about hackers and a few days agree with

447
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,760
me but i'm pretty sure you probably do
you like to kind of a you know blog and

448
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,010
talk about what they do and say show off
and so

449
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:01,710
Hey look at what I've done you know this
is a you know this is basically what I

450
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,180
did and this is how I did it

451
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:15,750
so here you go so okay so let's keep
going here so in a printed version 2 of

452
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,490
game of hacks time is not computed at
the server level with a little bit of a

453
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,490
impact and latency but not too much

454
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,810
so that's basically what we did we
change the second version we included a

455
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:36,270
timer version in the name of an
explosion - okay so what else what else

456
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,440
could be an issue with the timer the
ideas

457
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,500
well this

458
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,340
this is one

459
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,260
and out through again through the hacker
forms basically you're using an iphone

460
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,700
if you played on iphone you can pause
the time or by holding your finger on

461
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,220
the iphone screen

462
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,250
it's pretty a pretty interesting little
hack

463
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,150
now we didn't even know that but again
our friends here in the hacker community

464
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,279
they did and they they posted about it
so something fun some things that you

465
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,669
know kind of a pretty interesting things
that you can come up with you know you

466
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,600
in the wild as you kind of put these
days honey pots out in the wild and let

467
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,100
people kind of go and play with them and
they post a bunch of their you know

468
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:31,449
their experience out on the web for Rita
really see so many questions about game

469
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,390
of hacks any general questions about
what we've done there i mean i got a

470
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,870
whole another 20 minutes here have some
more technical and for them and walk you

471
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,600
through but at the impacts level of you
get a chance go out and play the game

472
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,110
you can also go out there when you can
also submit your own code if you want

473
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,110
you can go out there and play against
your friends

474
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,700
it's pretty cool pretty cool game it
really tests your your skill level like

475
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,090
if you think you're you know like I'm
all I know application security and you

476
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,870
know expert go out there and try to play
expert in a good try to try something

477
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,649
coats

478
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:09,250
it's pretty interesting to see how you
do see how you fare ok so with that any

479
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,530
questions about the game of tax game

480
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,490
okay all right well let's go ahead and
talk about

481
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,149
we're going to go into more know Jas I
want to get into kind of talk to you

482
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,589
about what no Jas it no Jas is the
platform talk about the database talk

483
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:28,060
about all the implications with building
platforms on know Jas and that's

484
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,089
basically how we build game of hacks so
it's kind of whether they're not

485
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:38,409
correlate here so no Jas is architect
basically this is the architecture of

486
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:43,869
know Jas it's a single-threaded
architecture and so that basically one

487
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:49,240
thread for every know Jas process
basically what you have here is you have

488
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,219
an event queue with events

489
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:54,158
there's a constant loop here it's a
single through the loop that listens for

490
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,540
these events basically pop off and they
can do specific operations might be a

491
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,380
file system

492
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,700
the file system I oh when you talk to
the database rights under the database

493
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,710
you might do a network call any of those
types of operations basically registers

494
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,119
or call back and then that callback goes
to the queue and then it gets triggered

495
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,329
as it kind of goes in the loop here now

496
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:22,599
that's pretty a pretty technical
technical overview of the the the

497
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,650
framework here

498
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:29,470
um but uh what I like - I like to use
this example I think it's a little more

499
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,808
straightforward folks that in the past
and restaurants basically think about a

500
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:35,920
fast food restaurant

501
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,400
you got you so you going to McDonalds or
my favorite burger king

502
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,579
you go up to the register and order some
food

503
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,549
there's usually one guy there take your
order you can think of that as a single

504
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:46,210
thread

505
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,269
he processes your order and the order
goes off and you got the little event

506
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:51,549
handlers with the workers they kind of
go off

507
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,700
make your burger go off get your fries
let's get a drink

508
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:58,598
boom there's your return that's
essentially kind of the how the

509
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,910
architecture works with with no Jess

510
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,640
ok so with that there's some pros and
cons to with every architecture there's

511
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,769
a pro account too that basically with
with the architecture for know Jas the

512
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,430
positive side of using architecture like
this is it's very good at doing

513
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,868
I Oh intensive for input operate input
opera up

514
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:26,019
I Oh intensive applications database
crudities applications with high users

515
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,169
thorough parts are usually typically web
apps right you need to process a lot of

516
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,390
things relatively quickly

517
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,440
it's pretty good at doing that that's
why a lot of companies have migrated

518
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,029
their platforms to the know Jas
architecture away from other types of

519
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:43,029
architect

520
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,800
a

521
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,610
there's conditional operators that they
will actually execute against the

522
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,930
database in this case there's things
that like a dollar sign greater than

523
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:34,830
about dollars and less than those who
actually execute inside that JSON object

524
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:40,470
right when it when it gets parsed and so
you have to be careful here because if

525
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,680
you run this am I

526
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:59,980
it's goodbye i get this to say greater
than one course

527
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:05,260
out demo here isn't working right

528
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,999
but Lawrence

529
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,419
this one is here we'll see i'll try to
get one more shot and then all will call

530
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:18,129
it but basically what i was trying to
illustrate is that you can execute those

531
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:25,719
you can actually execute those
conditional operators greater than or

532
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,469
less than if it evaluates to true it
will essentially give you

533
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:37,959
you can basically bypass the greater
than here you can basically a bypass the

534
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:41,769
the check so greater than a dozen of
them

535
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:53,799
I don't have the value that with the
anyways . . being have the script

536
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,229
somewhere on my machine but can't find
it right now

537
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:59,739
basically those operators there's a
couple operators you can check that the

538
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:04,929
mongodb uh documentation specifically
for but basically what it's doing is

539
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:10,779
it's those those values values operators
will execute and actually if i use the

540
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:16,479
regular expression one is another
example of the of another operator that

541
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,229
execute against the mongo DB back end

542
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:24,189
ok so basically here

543
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:29,468
this type of for that this type of
injection and a typical work around

544
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:33,339
would be to do a comparison against a
potential candidate password if you just

545
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:37,839
did up there look up here you can also
there's also another type of

546
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,419
vulnerability and oj s not only the
operator the operator overload basically

547
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:47,558
that are that are happening in the using
those also if you run a regular

548
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,489
expression operator which is very common
people do regular expressions all the

549
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,089
time

550
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,859
if you use that to do a lookup you could
also overload the the process and

551
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:00,380
basically right you get a regular
expression in our service which

552
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:06,680
then again basically what i have here
and so I will try this one and see if

553
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
this works

554
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,869
see this

555
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:25,940
my shame I love

556
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,360
change is always so much fun is copy and
paste in there is kinda guess we're

557
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,080
going here

558
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:42,130
we'll run this and basically we weren't
able to log in and basically kind of

559
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:47,320
blew up on us in this case so yeah not
not working there

560
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,700
but anyways be be aware if you're going
to be going to work with an oj s at

561
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,710
architecture remember your we'll go
ahead and jump here to these uh to our

562
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,370
to our takeaways here for this

563
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,049
these types of vulnerabilities that I've
been able to demonstrate here so up back

564
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,240
to Game of hacks just to kind of take
away here

565
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,279
the gamification education piece again
you're building a one of the key things

566
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,660
with with no JR with the game of hacks
was that knowledge is key to help

567
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,040
deliver secure code you can get folks of
all ages to join retained this

568
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,990
information anytime you have a chance to
make morning more fun specifically if

569
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,910
you're going to be writing code you can
do that it's a really cool kind of

570
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,620
demonstration that you can use

571
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:37,509
I've seen we've actually had some of our
customers actually take this and kind of

572
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,660
build this into their kind of like
center of excellence they took game of

573
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,649
Game of hacks and kind of custom
tailored it for their security

574
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:50,800
department so that they could so that
they could use you can use game hacks to

575
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,610
basically trained their developers on
how to not make the same type of coding

576
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:59,740
mistakes and be more security aware kind
of you achieve some of those problems

577
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,299
that the CC shows that were surveyed in
the beginning and address

578
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,020
ok some key elements to think about when
you're when you're writing code

579
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,580
specifically for platforms like no Jas
or any platform for that matter

580
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,480
always make sure to validate your input
make sure you validate the structure

581
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,860
make sure you have a permitted set of
characters that you that you allow

582
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,420
another big thing that I've learned over
my you know kind of career going through

583
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,980
kind of app sec is that each coding
language has its you know has its

584
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,180
pitfalls right

585
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,569
java.net you get done and get sharp TV

586
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,369
java you got driving at c++ every
different coding language out there

587
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:44,259
there's several different coding
languages on each coding language could

588
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:48,400
have its own variation of its own own
vulnerability type now to take away from

589
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,700
what we talked about and learn today
particularly with no Jas

590
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,788
we have a new platform that's out and is
very popular things like sequel

591
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:04,509
injection are still still apparent but
now there are just specific to the no

592
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:08,890
jazz platform and that's why they're
there still still problematic

593
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,459
it's just you know like I like to like
basically i say here under the OGS

594
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,269
architecture

595
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:17,288
you got a new platform at the same rules
apply with respect to security

596
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,730
ok and then some of the vulnerabilities
that we addressed at that

597
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,839
I tried to demonstrate here and no jess
was obviously didn't have service worked

598
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,069
pretty straightforward

599
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:31,058
I think it to show you the week rip
crypto demonstration because our rainbow

600
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:32,890
tables down at the moment

601
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:37,240
um but we actually is a pretty slick
demo and basically what it meant to do

602
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:44,258
is that basically what we were able to
do here with no Jason single process

603
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:50,529
no Jas the core architecture uses
google's v8 engine inside the the

604
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:55,539
process and inside that process it uses
a site a random number generator

605
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:59,349
ok in the sight of random if you guys
take a look at our little role that we

606
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:04,660
have outside and that site around number
generator that Google v8 uses its

607
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,759
basically uses map that random

608
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:13,450
okay Matt that random it's not really
it's known that that particular random

609
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:18,279
number generators been known to be
hacked made it back back like 2009 by a

610
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:22,630
security guy actually had a long time
ago Google knows about it and just I

611
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,380
don't want to go too much in the details
but the problem is that's that's inside

612
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,119
of the OGS platform so something to be
aware about within each node process

613
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,010
that that

614
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,750
Matt random being used don't use the
default map that random chatter number

615
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,900
random generator inside know Jas because
you can have week

616
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,780
there's a vulnerability for a week
crypto you want to use it like a an

617
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,380
open-source third-party known

618
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,280
saito random number generating ok

619
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,370
other vulnerability types that I
couldn't I couldn't show off but Jason

620
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,460
sequel injection definitely
vulnerability out there and then also

621
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,790
regular expression analysis and many
more

622
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,390
and if I had more time I would I would
love to share those if you're interested

623
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,279
in kind of a note security project

624
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,870
I point to note security I oh it's kind
of an open source project that's open

625
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,839
for do a node node security

626
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,950
so if you're interested you can
contribute enjoying it but uh with that

627
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,480
i think i got about three of three or
five minutes left here i'll leave the

628
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,250
link the rest for a couple questions

629
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,300
I kind of think you a you guys have any
general questions about kind of what we

630
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,200
covered today

631
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,200
now great you guys have fun

632
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,380
all right well hey thank you very much
for joining and I have any questions

633
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:34,770
step down
