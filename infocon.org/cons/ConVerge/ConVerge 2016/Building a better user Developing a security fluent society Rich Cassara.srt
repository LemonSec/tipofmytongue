1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
try to figure this place to put them

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:38,170
test four

3
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,170
no not really getting much

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,710
how am I levels again

5
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:53,919
how does this sound back here that I can
project

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,589
um I have a cup there

7
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:15,250
I could use it yeah that would be great
thank you all right I'm okay you know

8
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:31,000
what you've got is a great reason up a
little bit back buddy how's it sound

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,660
from there

10
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,080
good no it's not coming together and
it's it's on

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:46,300
yeah i just have to raise it up more I
think speaking

12
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,539
yeah I think it's coming through a bit
better now

13
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,459
okay that's perfect

14
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:21,260
you can probably get started

15
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:42,590
thank you

16
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,910
so yeah I'm happy to be here at the
third year of converge

17
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,709
I this is my third presentation at a
security con all three of them at

18
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,060
converge

19
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,950
because i don't like to travel I'd like
to stay home too close to home

20
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,059
I live in ann arbor michigan so it's not
too far from here

21
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,860
and so this gives me a good opportunity
to practice took to put together some

22
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,510
ideas and work on some peaches and
talking to people about some ideas that

23
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,630
i have that usually just bounce around
on Twitter and IRC but now we can get it

24
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:17,930
out

25
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,730
well a wider audience and hopefully down
the line I'll be able to travel more

26
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,220
cons and be possibly do speeches there
but you guys are lucky to be a converge

27
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,200
for you the only people get this evening

28
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,209
so are just a quick introduction arm

29
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,630
I'm a cotton so my name is Richard
Kucera I work mostly in dev ops and

30
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:49,190
security operations arm and I've been
really into the security community over

31
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,420
the last few years have been
participating in my second events and

32
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,040
other local local Midwest security

33
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:05,238
so the thing that I wanted to talk about
was was a problem that everybody has in

34
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,209
our environments and that's no matter
what you do you can have the most

35
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,830
lockdown environment

36
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,140
but everybody has one big vulnerability
that they need to worry about and that's

37
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:25,520
your user errors are no matter what you
do you can have a user coming a user

38
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,830
behavior can screw it all up

39
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,599
huh we all have our own stories or
horror stories we've heard from

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,820
co-workers about users who click on
anything that pops up on your screen

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,150
who will respond to any obvious phishing
emails or people who just put their

42
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,400
password on a sticky note on their
laptop the users I think they're doing a

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,000
better job but the sticky note under the
keyboard but that's really not much

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,170
better when you have a pen tester that
gets in their arm

45
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:03,260
so what is the cause of this problem is
if it's the stupid users know we we

46
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,310
can't do that you can't think of our
users as being stupid and there's

47
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,020
there's been a lot of talks I've seen at
convergence you're already about like

48
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,760
trying to get out of this toxic
adversarial mindset where where the

49
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,580
enlightened IT people and their the
lowly math is that we're better than you

50
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,020
know there's already a stereotype of the
condescending I teacher

51
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,450
uh we don't need to fuel that we need to
have a better relationship and trying to

52
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,060
understand why the users are making
these mistakes that to us team obvious

53
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,730
um so the cause it's not stupidity and
ignorance is not the same as stupidity

54
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,950
but rather it's just that users don't be
hatin surely that's what we need to to

55
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,300
address as as why aren't they behaving
securely and what can we do to fix it

56
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,020
um so the shower thought I had that kind
of kicked off this idea was that if we

57
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,919
think about secure you know behaving
securely is something like a foreign

58
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,950
language and that so for people like us
who attend these these cons who are

59
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,590
working in security and an IT

60
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,960
we're either you know native speakers of
security in that it's always made sense

61
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,400
to us to behave in a secure way to have
strong passwords that are not written

62
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
out anywhere

63
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,670
arm or it's something that we've learned
over the years and we become fluent and

64
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,050
security but to two other people who
don't live and breathe this who are

65
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,060
working with it everyday it

66
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,930
it's like foreign language where it just
might not make sense to them intuitively

67
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:47,500
um so we really need to consider that
they're not native speakers they don't

68
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,110
understand the same things we do and so
we need to figure out a way to get them

69
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,650
to understand these ideas are we want to
get if we get the maximum number of

70
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,409
people in the world who can understand
this at a base level then the baseline

71
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,420
security of your average user is going
to be much higher and we'll have a

72
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:17,080
lesser chance of attacks gaining a
foothold in your organization's so if

73
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,620
others

74
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,410
there's kind of two ways to attack the
idea of improving our users security are

75
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:31,420
the one way is technologically we can
make more user-friendly and more more

76
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:38,260
secure by default software so that's the
improve user friendliness column here

77
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,090
and there's a lot of companies that are
doing great work in that area from that

78
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,880
i highlighted this are you oh security
they make a two-factor authentication

79
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,660
you're not aware of them and they so
they make a really simple way to you let

80
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,150
users have a two-factor authentication
through their smartphone and it is

81
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,760
really seamless and painless to end
users so that even the least technical

82
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,010
person they just have to be

83
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,640
they have an app on their phone they log
in and then it brings them on their

84
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,450
phones to say what you want to prove
this log in and they proved when they're

85
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,800
logging themselves in

86
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,790
if somebody stole their credentials and
tries to log in they know that

87
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,200
somebody's trying to get in

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,760
they deny it and it's block it makes it
that it's done really well

89
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,289
makes it really easy for anybody to do
and companies that have rolled it out

90
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,598
her are generally very happy with it

91
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,680
um I know that two-factor authentication
I've seen before then was

92
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,299
really just abysmal up for the end user
it was good

93
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,599
it didn't work nearly as well and it was
just frustrating

94
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,010
and that doesn't help engender good
security

95
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,470
I'm another another company I with the
Amazon their web services they're

96
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,080
allowing small medium businesses instead
of having to run your own server where

97
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,730
you might have one or two IT people who
may or may not be well versed in

98
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,250
securing their servers are running an
operation and then those servers are

99
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,580
just easy targets for any attacker out
there

100
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,830
um Amazon's made it easy and cost
effective for people who don't need a

101
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,350
big infrastructure to roll out their web
server their servers in the cloud and by

102
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,950
default it's a much more secure
environment

103
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,390
Amazon's automatically patching there
watching the network for obvious attacks

104
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,290
they're blocking a lot of stuff that
people now don't have to worry about

105
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,099
you can still set up something in amazon
and make it very vulnerable but you have

106
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,120
to try more it's more secure by default
but then these so that's improving user

107
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,370
friendliness but the thing that I want
to talk about more is improving our user

108
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,110
awareness and what can we do to make
people more aware of security so we want

109
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,200
to think about what can we do to do that

110
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,700
most the biggest thing is that people
have these standards that they have user

111
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,600
trainings

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,750
Tom and this is kind of a standard user
training where you get like a quiz or a

113
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,750
little hat or flash

114
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,560
god forbid make people install flash to
take a user training to make them more

115
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,790
secure but you make them less secure by
looking plants on their system but

116
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,699
that's besides the point the point is
the so users go through the this is a

117
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,480
fishing training so they have a little
fishy to tell you that this is a

118
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,500
phishing email and they go through these
these exercises and they'll be a little

119
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,010
quiz and then we'll get a little search
certificate they can print out that

120
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,540
shows to their managers and bosses at
the done the user training and bosses

121
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,839
can say hey we did user training where
we're more secure now

122
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:52,219
but the thing is that was

123
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,060
you know you took a few hours out of
your employees day to do that and they

124
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,160
might remember all this information for
a day or two but then over time if

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,230
they're not thinking about it all the
time

126
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,680
they're just going to forget about it
and that's it's not going to stick you

127
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,510
might get some tiny games and
improvement but it's still it's not

128
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,850
improving that much

129
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:20,180
so the way that I was thinking about
this is that for really getting

130
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,410
information to stick with people you
need to tell them a story on

131
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,120
storytelling throughout human history
has been how we communicated most

132
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,560
effectively even before we had written
language we were storytelling species

133
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,079
arm and actually yesterday

134
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,520
jhankar delegated talk which was in it
he's starting a storytelling series it

135
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,750
was really fantastic

136
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,130
you missed yesterday i recommend
watching it will probably be up on iron

137
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,240
site soon

138
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,360
if it's not already huh so storytelling
is really important for for really

139
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,070
communicating information people and so
you know throughout history

140
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,740
thousands of years ago we had a sock
told great stories through fables and we

141
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,900
still tell those same ones today

142
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,970
sometimes a new forms sometimes very
similar to the original work again

143
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,050
now for thousands of years we've been
telling the parables of Jesus Christ

144
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,780
you know telling story using stories to
tell teach lessons that you want people

145
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,370
to really understand

146
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,990
and again this he was highly mentioned
in Joel's talk that I talked about

147
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,470
Richard pine men have more recently the
wonderful brilliant physicist and the

148
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,560
way that he taught people was to really
engaged people use telling stories able

149
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,910
to engage people on their own on a level
that they understood to communicate

150
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,920
complex concepts that anyone could
understand when you see I've gotten an

151
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,979
asterisk on the story part because the
story has to be good if you have a

152
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,590
terrible story already

153
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,370
a you know story with not much feeling
in it it's not going to communicate

154
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,220
anything to highlight that we have this
year

155
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,060
I don't know if you've seen me is
there's a bunch of their essentially

156
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,680
advertisements but they try to make it a
story with these really bad

157
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,739
comics that they did for dmca put these
out and this doesn't it's just telling

158
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,850
you about their product

159
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,570
this is not going to resonate with
anyone about why they should use their

160
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,490
two-factor authentication

161
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,910
um but we'll come back to storytelling
the bit so we want to we want to improve

162
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:38,000
our general populations awareness of
security and so how can we go about

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,140
doing this

164
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,270
and the thing that I wanted to do was to
go back in time to the nineteen fifties

165
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,069
and we're going to take a break from
security instead of the problem being

166
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,100
our users having poor awareness

167
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,070
the problem is that people are throwing
trash everywhere so we got a roadside

168
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,150
littering problem because there's a
highway system has been implemented

169
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,010
there's a whole lot of new disposable
products fast food joints are starting

170
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,240
to appear

171
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,700
um there's no cultural background though
of what do we do with this garbage

172
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,660
so what we end up with is a lot of
garbage alongside highways and this was

173
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,120
being problem from for many years

174
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm so the solution ultimately was that
in individual groups of people who were

175
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,010
concerned and then that concerned about
the the littering problems they would

176
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,530
start groups and they would push that
would get those groups grew and they

177
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,610
became more power

178
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,930
you know got more members were able to
bring up ideas to their local

179
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,930
governments push them up higher and
higher

180
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:54,140
Tom they started to get enough funding
to launch ad campaigns like the crying

181
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,660
Indian who side though not actually an
American Indian but was an italian

182
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,930
american actor then we had woodsy owl
and the important thing here was

183
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:11,180
targeting children with friendly cartoon
characters and we'll get into that a

184
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,620
little bit more later

185
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,120
and again continuing at targeting
children we have an entire TV show that

186
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,550
is this

187
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:24,810
actually an ad campaign for don't litter
and so they have the ad campaigns and

188
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,849
then they were able to get legislation
passed both at the state and local level

189
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,680
where you would have fines for littering
alongside rose and at the national level

190
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,979
where we got the establishment of the
EPA richard nixon signed in and we were

191
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,730
able to push out all these laws and
resident legislation and eventually you

192
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,690
know we're at a point today where
littering doesn't seem to be nearly as

193
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,510
much a problem as it used to be and it
took a long time because it required com

194
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,130
as people grow in the generations come
up they need to adjust to the new

195
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,339
cultural north and that got me thinking

196
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:12,420
off to a tangent on how people are kind
of like programs and so in this case

197
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,449
we're doing a object-oriented program so
we have our parent class and our parent

198
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,070
has I'm sorry this is a little small but
i think it should be pretty visible the

199
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,709
US or parent has some variables some
constants and functions and it's in this

200
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:34,170
case our parent does stuff we're going
to say this parent class was written in

201
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,760
the nineteen forties but now this parent
class has a child class that inherits

202
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,870
from it

203
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,829
the child inherits the same kind of
variables and constants that the the

204
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:49,109
parents able to pass down but when when
we have a new class that inherits they

205
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,880
can have new things built onto it and
those things that are built on come from

206
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,079
the environment that it that it's being
written in and so in this case that is

207
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,029
this child is growing up and writing its
its code we now have added a garbage

208
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,910
collection function the GC at the bottom
there

209
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,800
so now the the pic the child class has
this garbage collection function that

210
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,168
parent didn't do so that the child has
learned some new behaviors but then

211
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:21,000
furthermore that child class can have
another class that inherits from it

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,589
the grandchild class

213
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,448
and this one has a new garbage collector
that's improved because the from the

214
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,279
original child class

215
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,279
it was only getting the instructions for
garbage collection in this case from its

216
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,230
environment from where was being written
but the grandchild inherited that in in

217
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,510
that class and then it was able to
improve upon it from its environment so

218
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,169
it's as we as we grow and we as people
age and generations progress

219
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:57,360
that's how society progresses how we we
decide that something that we are doing

220
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,649
or not doing

221
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:04,500
need to change and so it slowly trickles
down and as the you know the child can

222
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,690
then influence the jet grandchild

223
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,720
in addition to the society around

224
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,730
so that's enough getting off on that
that side tracked so we're gonna head

225
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,539
back to the present and back to security

226
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:25,980
so the good news is that cultural
awareness around security is in fact

227
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,990
growing and the the evidence for this
i'm going to go back to talking about

228
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,049
storytelling in our current but what how
we tell stories or mostly how we

229
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,639
communicate stories is through our media
for television and movies

230
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,830
so as far as movies go a primary
starting point for hacking and computer

231
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,750
security movies as more games was back
in nineteen eighty-three of almost

232
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:01,980
decade later we had sneakers came out
which is a amazing film which was a big

233
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,210
influence on me talking about how
storytelling can really resonates when I

234
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,010
saw that film

235
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,950
i loved it i still love it but it was
like for something that really i really

236
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,919
took to heart a lot of the messaging
from it on security and had I known

237
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,350
earlier that that was actually like a
career path I might have started in

238
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,350
security boy did but then it

239
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,969
I do the Securities circuitous route
through IT and eventually decided to

240
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,800
focus on security but

241
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,250
you know having that background of like
really loving security from having

242
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,500
watched a movie when I was younger

243
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,830
that's that's a you know speaks to the
power of storytelling

244
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,180
then we move on to hackers in 95

245
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,280
swordfish came out in 2001 so these are
every few years we have them we were

246
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,190
having these movies come out that focus
on hacking or computer security but in

247
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,140
the last few years it seems like they're
coming out one after another and it's

248
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,060
not just movies now we're also getting
see TV shows focused on computer

249
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,169
security and now there are all of their
of varying quality

250
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,660
some of them are are widely derided by
our community

251
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,840
um but the thing is the it for this
purpose for trying to get everybody you

252
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,490
know society as a whole

253
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,760
interested in security TV is better than
movies movies because of their format

254
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,100
can have a stronger emotional impact on
a person but we want to change behavior

255
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,050
if we want to change behavior

256
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:48,510
TV is giving you more time movie you
watch a movie for about two hours or so

257
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,740
and then you might be watching at some
point in the future but you've watched

258
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,490
it and you may or may not take away the
message from it and then you go about

259
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,810
your merry way

260
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:02,669
TV shows if somebody's into interested
in TV show if they get hooked on one

261
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,760
there watching it once a week for a
whole season

262
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,120
that's like eight hours of content and
it's being regularly reinforced and even

263
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,290
television shows that aren't strictly
focused on security

264
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,670
they're adding elements of computer
security into them

265
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,860
i'm particularly like um political
intrigue shows seem to have plot lines

266
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,000
that involved

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,290
somebody hacking information from
somebody else and the when these ideas

268
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,210
get out to more people

269
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,240
there's more of a chance that something
is going to click with someone that hey

270
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,160
this could happen to me

271
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,670
I could maybe I can do something about
it and change my behavior

272
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:51,000
um so we're going to be so what part of
the talk and wrap up the so it is fun to

273
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,539
make fun of when the show's screws up
how they present things

274
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,220
it's a lot of fun to make jokes and put
snarky tweets out on Twitter

275
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,659
um but it is important that they're
there

276
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:08,940
that means that there's an interest in
in the general population for learning

277
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,890
more about computer security and that
there's funding in Hollywood

278
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,730
they're you know they're willing to put
money behind putting these ideas out

279
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,270
so that's a good thing for us and we
need to encourage that

280
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,830
um and so when things get popular if
security becomes the paper show becomes

281
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,699
popular

282
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,789
it's it's easy to fall into disdaining
things that are popular as being bad

283
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:40,710
could we like to be exclusive we like to
think Oh only me and my little group

284
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,580
like this thing like if everybody likes
it then it's it's crap

285
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,189
and that's kind of like you know that
the hipster who disdains you know

286
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,440
popular music but like it

287
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,440
a hipster can come around and learn to
appreciate something popular like Taylor

288
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,110
Swift music and we need we need to be
able to be flexible like that

289
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,139
um so I want to I want everyone to go
out and make security great again except

290
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,409
security was never great in the first
place so let's just make it three

291
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,179
and so we need everybody to be a
storyteller to the people around you

292
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,770
tell your your stories to people who
aren't into security

293
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,850
you know it's it's great inventions we
can tell each other stories about what

294
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,260
we've been doing at work things that
we've the interesting things that we

295
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,220
know but we need to be able to
communicate those stories outside our

296
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:45,600
circle and get more people to to really
click with security arm and it's an

297
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,639
important thing with with storytelling
it's so storytelling uh technology

298
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,940
without storytelling doesn't go anywhere

299
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,420
so we can have a great technology that
doesn't interesting things like Google

300
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,030
glass was really interesting piece of
tech doing really cool things but it

301
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,440
didn't really have a story around a
story telling everybody

302
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,950
why you want this um so without a
storytelling it nothing happens you get

303
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,320
a dumpster fire but if you take that and
you turn it around and add something a

304
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,220
story

305
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,220
why do I want this product

306
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:39,600
all of a sudden everything's changed
around so storytelling another one we

307
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,110
tell stories through art arm you know

308
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,409
in addition to stories there's other
things that we can do you go out and

309
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,980
make art this was just tweeted a few
days ago

310
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,430
this is a low key who's fantastically
smart guy and now he will tweet it out

311
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,720
that he wants to make a series of games
that teach information security and

312
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,850
inform the mindset at the same time and
that's amazing I I hope he gets started

313
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,290
on that I would be happy to help him
with that or you know we should we

314
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,720
should go out and embrace projects like
these

315
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,820
there's also a hacker strip is a project
where they're making comic strips comic

316
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:24,360
books based on the real exploits of real
hackers and that's a you know it's a

317
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,340
really great idea for getting
information out that might reach a wider

318
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,159
audience might resonate with people and
might end up building a better user

319
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,770
thank you

320
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:54,300
I time for I think I have time for
questions if anybody has any or we can

321
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:29,189
yes I I i think i think that is
definitely something that can be that I

322
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,720
think there definitely will be a ship
there there's actually they have um I

323
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,620
don't know how widespread the program is
that they have programs for high school

324
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,330
students arm

325
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,340
I believe they're through the federal
government has a up like hacking

326
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,350
challenges for high schoolers to try and
recognize our talents and to get

327
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,020
internships into in two places

328
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,580
so if it's something that is happening
it's still like at the beginning stages

329
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,659
but it is it something that can improve

330
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,170
certainly

331
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
yes

332
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:42,450
yeah um there are well

333
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,740
so actually the keynote um I don't know
if you were at the keynote downstairs

334
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,890
but ben ten heat his original talk on
his hit the security program that he set

335
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,630
up at his previous employer was really
powerful because it

336
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,740
I mean in in that sense the story it
told was if you do a better job at

337
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,690
security you can get prizes

338
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,809
I'm but that's a story that works for
people armed

339
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:16,379
yeah yeah yeah you need that you need to
have at least enough of a budget but I

340
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,760
mean you don't need a large a huge
budget i think he and i believe it was

341
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,620
something like a hundred dollar amazon
gift cards that he was handing out to

342
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,330
employees and that was you know you give
out one per month or something that's

343
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,550
only twelve hundred dollars so it can be
here it can be done on a pretty tight

344
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,550
small budget

345
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:52,390
okay thank you
