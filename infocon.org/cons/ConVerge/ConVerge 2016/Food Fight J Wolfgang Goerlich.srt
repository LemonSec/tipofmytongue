1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,639
right now we have my favorite

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:25,799
hey all right yes this talk is food
fight this is some lessons learned from

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,390
the food industry and i am one of the
crowd

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,809
volunteers and organizers of this
conference I love this event i'm also

5
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,120
with CBI at CBI one of the things i do
is put on the CBI Academy which is a

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,500
two-year program they come in that work
under me for a while for people and he

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,070
get rotated around there are different
practices so I if you see any of our

8
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,539
Academy people say I don't this is my
current team my team you guys in row

9
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,840
see I is a mighty responder

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,489
thank you you could send me up in this
mighty risk management from in its right

11
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,079
so we do pen test

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,290
I would you risk assessments we doing
all the fun stuff

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,070
this project was done with my previous
Academy team

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,570
I'm so shallow to them they did a lot of
the work that a lot of graphs and the

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,380
crunching the data you're about to see
up and this is going to go really really

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,000
quickly because we look at 15 different
food manufacturing plants 15 different

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,119
locations at the technology are running
at the problems are having

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,869
I'm sorry i pasted a lot so if you're
lucky keeping the video

19
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,110
I'm so we look at 15 of these and I'm
going to do this in 30 minutes so it's

20
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,900
really going to be like a lightning
strike there's gonna be a lot of stuff

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,759
really really quickly

22
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,229
it's cool i'm around all the time i'm on
twitter is already mentioned so hit me

23
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,229
up afterwards if you want to dig into
this details of any of these things

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,869
so with that let's start talking about
me when I started down this road and

25
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,810
started thinking about food
manufacturing food processing

26
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,899
I kind of had like this is rolling
fields right

27
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,100
this beautiful pastors this farmland
that we're going to go visit and it's

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,079
going to be great we can like walk up
and c mon on and hear about what they've

29
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,360
been doing raising the cows and chickens

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
but of course real life is a completely
different

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,380
this is a food processing system right
this

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,700
is manufacturing this is everything we
see in the heart of the Motor City when

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,230
it comes to industrial controls these
food processors have the same technology

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,200
and not only that they have tons and
tons of electrical now technology we

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,000
mentioned the consumer spokes and so
consumers talk here later on a converge

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,920
that same technology is in these food
processors and why because they got to

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,899
reclaim the power because power is so
expensive and they have reclamation

38
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,620
engines their power generation engines
are capturing methane which you may not

39
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,680
know about the food in the street is in
a single year

40
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,190
this industry consumes in north america
the same amount of power as Utah the

41
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,480
entire city utah

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,530
spread them out that's what these people
are pumping through the system's again

43
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,690
the exact same systems are are covered
by newark sip and some more regulations

44
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,660
and that's important right because if
you look at what happened with power

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,620
plants all the time like this one out in
Ukraine and John never ever ever able to

46
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,590
pronounce of when these criminals going
back these plans off but when they do

47
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,700
these attacks against the power grid
that same technology is in our foods

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,810
black similar with water it takes a lot
of water to get animals to to the table

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,680
I i forget like I think it's like 10,000
gallons for a cow

50
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,320
it takes just a 10 gallons of water per
single chicken to run to the processing

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,190
plant right and cleaning and cooking
Eric and then think about these plants

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,109
are doing millions of chickens

53
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,510
so the amount of water that this
industry consumes is huge

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,790
across North America ten percent of all
the fresh water gets consumed pump

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,840
process

56
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,820
reclaimed and recycled by the technology
within the food industry

57
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,519
now again think about some new attacks
you guys hear about the Bosman New York

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,670
bother anyone hear about this one - now
serves attack

59
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,700
it took the the down down there trying
to open up the dama

60
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,920
what kind of exciting

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,090
and camry water company is awesome
that's not the real name hence the

62
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:27,119
quotes summary water company was it was
attacked and they got in this system is

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
really old legacy is this mike an AI
actually you know terrible old system

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,470
and I mean really old like Hannibal not
like no harp legal then was talking me

65
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,580
and he's like I got this industry just
recently not the old days when hardly

66
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,120
head

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,180
thanks back thank you for that

68
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,360
not good rookie no i'm talking like
nineteen eighties old like war game

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,380
style

70
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,219
I'll whopper system sitting there
processing the guys broke in they were

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,850
able to modify the ph value and there
was basically poison the water supply

72
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,350
so check that was very interesting this
same technology is in the food Institute

73
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,270
same technology is everywhere

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,710
so food is basically a modern marvel
when it comes to technology processing

75
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,270
manufacturing movie food to the line
pumping the water keeping electricity

76
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,330
going all the same technologies and all
the same vulnerabilities we see

77
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,750
everywhere but without the same
regulations right nurse it doesn't

78
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,300
necessarily apply to boot which is what
some energy

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,320
there's not regs that cover the water in
the food supply

80
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,219
very interesting and and because we have
all the same risks we begin to start to

81
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,210
think what could possibly happen so I'm
going to give you guys all trigger

82
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,239
warning if anyone's got sensitive
stomach i'm going to give you all moment

83
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
to step out

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,860
I'm not going to anymore meeting cut out
why I will but not in the next slide

85
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,500
what we're about to show you is what
happens like every single time there's a

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,340
pentas it happens so often that as a
blue team or when I used to be a

87
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,849
security officer when I'd see it like a
windows computer I'd freak out of your

88
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,840
gonna just everyone take a collective
pause and give me a moment and I'm

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,260
talking of course about calculator

90
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,370
damn that every bone doesn't launch
calculator you guys notice that's like

91
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,980
oh we popped XP we r + calculator

92
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,360
I'm we popped word we ran calculator
there's out there is a brand new like

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,050
way of doing software development
continuous integration it's in the cloud

94
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,650
and arms Jenkins and

95
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,500
and there's a vulnerability and all
obviously what they did was there a

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,790
calculator

97
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,090
it's gotten so bad that i got my red
team doesn't even know where to like

98
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,830
launch calculor that's run of all on
windows so we're kind of gotten jaded

99
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,669
right

100
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:38,049
I guess I have yeah okay we got a ball
on this calculator yeah okay we didn't

101
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,190
keep the bad guys out there's ransomware
we gotta restore from lousy lk something

102
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,270
happen

103
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,349
meanwhile in real life and the food
industry

104
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,419
bad things can happen the food industry
has a very high risk or rate of

105
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:58,750
manufacturing accidents and I'm not x
back to hackers but all the same kinetic

106
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,240
forces such as a boiler rover running
and blowing up can happen because all

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,930
controlled by the same school systems
are skims the systems are vulnerable

108
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,760
you get explosions you got risk of
pathogens you get all our favorites

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,820
right like e.coli mad cow salmonella

110
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,780
these things are great you don't have
these deal and the awesome think he

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,559
Crocs

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,620
I got it for my Dharma kara I love you
have someone li

113
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,638
maybe why she's always trying to poison
me

114
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,120
but it was in real life bad stuff
happens right we're not just talking

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,870
about classic calculator type
vulnerabilities

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,740
so let me show you a little of what the
technology looks like i'm going to show

117
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,789
you about how do we assess it and then
we recover some of the findings we have

118
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:49,120
in general we talk about itno t your IT
being your stuff that we are fantastic

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
at right

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,130
we can secure your P we can secure our
corporate IT we can do network access

121
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,849
controls we can keep Ben 10 out we can
do other stuff

122
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,360
not really but least we've been working
on it for like 20-30 years

123
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,590
euro to your operational technology is
everything on this side of the graph

124
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,859
your skater systems your industrial
control systems

125
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,359
I'll write down to the PLC is that are
moving the chickens in the house and

126
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,130
getting all the orders out the doors

127
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,130
this type of technology we haven't
really looked at at all

128
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,210
generally security teams are really
focused on patching windows break folks

129
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,900
and patching servers giving some users
from education hoping that developers

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,260
are creating bonds and ignoring this
entire piece of the puzzle

131
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,590
which creates some interesting
opportunities especially when you're

132
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,550
talking about technology that could be
as old as the nineteen eighties x server

133
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,870
and its really like a completely
different realm of Technology writes a

134
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,500
completely different world you think
about most servers and maybe a couple

135
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,580
thousand dollars is this 10,000 you're
being really extravagant I can't

136
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,180
remember the last time we pay 10,000 for
anything I tea but it could happen

137
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,390
you're running for a couple years you
have your IT team do it you can scan it

138
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,710
you can patch it

139
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:04,220
you can do a pen test on it ok cool by
contrast the skate environment huge

140
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,750
difference we're talking millions of
dollars from his skin environments

141
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,160
arcadia the dev environment

142
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,910
haha your body though we're going out
well that's a million-dollar system

143
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,160
we're going to spend another million
that have on it

144
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,110
mm okay i can see that because they're
so expensive they run 20 to 30 years

145
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,580
I'll get to the age distribution little
bit but you can see why we've got this

146
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,210
really old stuff that goes on forever
and they're run by the operations team

147
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,750
which makes for some fantastic
conversation because it's completely

148
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,170
different dialogue for example my
growing operation seem ago

149
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,620
have you thought about wireless security
they're all our wire stuff is secure

150
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,770
like that that's awesome i didn't i
didn't know that because you have open

151
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,860
Wi-Fi don't know it's really is secure
our where this is a hundred percent

152
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,790
secure

153
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,030
click tell me tell me more about that
because we're seeing all these

154
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,370
vulnerabilities how's your wireless here
in the hall

155
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,510
well our where the scanners we lack in a
cabinet every night and no one gets tool

156
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,020
ok this extract the way that they talk
about rest to think about technology is

157
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,319
completely different in the way that
evolves to and just bridging that

158
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,010
communication gap let alone the
political gap in the operational divided

159
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,360
hugely difficult and a whole bunch of
different vendors to that we never get

160
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,010
to play with right now just to Windows
Mac Linux anyone here playing with

161
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,770
robots or on or hms not really not
really unless you are in those

162
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,689
industries are allen bradley is actually
the farthest ahead and this which is

163
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,750
good i'll come back to why that's going
to get it because they're actually

164
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,580
working really hard and with one of the
systems were at came in and sat down

165
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,630
with IT teams that here's what scared
looks like my perspective but most of

166
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,420
these guys don't even think about it
right that sent out the robot and they

167
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,180
run for 20 30 years they collect the
money nothing's dead

168
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,709
it's not like robots ever have any
problems much

169
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,650
actually when I was his robe on when I
saw the robust goes things we like tea

170
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,770
to write some Terminator is coming in
moving stuff around and i kinda like

171
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,910
herd the cows or maybe like a robot
chicken to be awesome but now it's all

172
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,569
all traditional factor robots but this
one in gray is here for a reason this

173
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,710
woman gray

174
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:14,190
I & Q 1 of this year this one had a
buffer overflow which meant that you can

175
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,290
come in remote in senator poison packet
and take control over it and move the

176
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,270
robot around the other control software

177
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,829
why this is important is because this
robot right here is moving like you know

178
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,050
thousands of pounds of meat

179
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,430
this close from a person and you could
probably do a little bit of damage there

180
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,089
right

181
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,840
if you got in and mess with it . is not
your typical farm not your typical tak

182
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,590
not your typical vulnerabilities and in
this space for the technology runs

183
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,600
forever and no one's talking to each
other

184
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,460
so how do you get into this environment
how do you look at it

185
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,860
how do you peel back that bought a
little bit and figure out where the

186
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,380
vulnerabilities are what we can start to
do about this

187
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,400
I'm going to walk through a five-step
high-level process that we follow when

188
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,420
you're looking at these 15 plants and
it's going to start with the most

189
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,150
an interesting thing I almost feel like
I should go to a trigger warning for

190
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,910
this one as well as social governance
right

191
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,420
it starts with missed you look at the
standards

192
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,969
53b maybe two and even though it isn't
necessarily the most exciting thing

193
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,890
the fact is that this is already done a
lot of work for the industrial controls

194
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,110
and creates that bridge that allows us
to talk about both the risks and the OT

195
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,810
environment and the i-team burn so we
can start looking at 53 feet or this

196
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,930
side and 84 the other side and assessing
against that , control show you how to

197
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,959
roll the step up at the end of this
project

198
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,020
the next thing is of course we've got to
come up with a really good project

199
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,100
management approach

200
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,990
i oftentimes they don't say that one of
the things that differentiates it really

201
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,760
good hacker team from a world-class
hacker team is project management the

202
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,850
ability to organize the right person
place to get them out really quickly

203
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,140
right if you think about like any heist
movie on the italian job

204
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,290
we all want to be the talent out how
much time was spent in project

205
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,949
management

206
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,070
I think project management would be a
lot more fun to actually taught it like

207
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,030
with the italian job and those sets of
heights but be that as it may we start

208
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,439
with religion project management and
here - pretty quickly we run into things

209
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
that we don't necessarily anticipate
from an IT perspective one of the ones

210
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,800
that were surprised me and I never
thought I get to talk about us to our

211
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,990
car going to start researching schedule

212
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,800
okay what could possible risks coping
resources schedule your wrist I never

213
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,380
thought about birds

214
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,770
you don't have to plan their projects
around birds

215
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:48,520
true story we can apply to certain
locations based the migratory path of

216
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,350
birds and operations folks knew this

217
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,110
they're looking at me the same way i was
looking at that when i was asking other

218
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,100
wireless can't like

219
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,490
well of course you can't do that can she
see the bird map I'm like there's a

220
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,390
program

221
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,560
like Angry Birds know the bird map wall

222
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,739
my call yeah okay sure the bird map told
me that one

223
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,360
so you gotta start peeling into some of
these differences and figuring out how

224
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,230
we're going to this plant so governance
and project management

225
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,230
there's an old saying guys are probably
heard this like if you want to have a

226
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,430
really good day you wake up in the
morning and you eat a frog because her

227
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,410
this to eat a frog

228
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,860
nothing else seems that higher than the
morning the rest of the days goes great

229
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,460
so you eat that frog you start with
government to start with project

230
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,630
planning and then you can get into
actually doing the technical and the one

231
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,520
thing that kind of struggles when we get
technical is there's a lot out there

232
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,390
how much we're going to look at how many
of these plant systems can we cover

233
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,730
how many of the nuts and bolts can we
catch the next that very important is be

234
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,720
incredibly realistic weigh the pros and
cons of evaluating these environments

235
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,370
way what you get in and how much of data
we can capture in a very short period of

236
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,180
time

237
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,849
our love like litmus test was is it
plugged into the network and is it

238
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,870
something that we can get packets off of
and is it running the time here were

239
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,960
there because we're trying to get in and
out we're doing this 15

240
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,440
within a week so we want to get in as
much as we can get as much inside the

241
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,610
risk get out

242
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,330
we figured we could probably get about
75% inside of the rest which is ok that

243
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,750
leaves a lot of unknowns but we knew we
could get the stuff that people you get

244
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,020
to which is the stuff the criminals
would go after which is the stuff that

245
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,050
criminals could send a package at and
make that things happen

246
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,339
so you want to come up with the approach
that's very quick that highlights the

247
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,930
rests gets as much as possible and gets
out of there and talked a lot about the

248
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,390
brother prince i love the product
principle right which is eighty percent

249
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,180
of the value comes from types of the
work with the twenty percent of the work

250
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,099
in this assessment so we can least begin
the conversation between the IT folks

251
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,529
now it's and pops

252
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,790
next thing is knowing that is being very
very creative

253
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:59,040
we can't scan these systems a lot of
times have you scan these systems you

254
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,029
take them offline and these are like you
know multimillion-dollar three lines

255
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:03,660
right

256
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,959
and almost every time you get the guys
like you're doing a pen test

257
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,389
are you like the last guy but no i'm
totally not like the last guy I know

258
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:19,649
about bird flights like I you know I
mean the last guy who did the the scan

259
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,279
I'm like will tell me tell me more about
the last that every single one of the

260
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,939
factories had a horror story with the
last guy came in

261
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:31,349
ran his skin didn't know what he was
doing not some plant system offline

262
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,610
they had thousands to millions of
dollars of downtime in one instance

263
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,029
there's a fly out and redo firmware
because the firmware no longer existed

264
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:41,999
moves in the market because these are
old systems right

265
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,300
they're not designed to be scanned
they're not designed to be hit

266
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,889
when then was talking about that chaos
environment the chaos monkey and these

267
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,459
systems have not run against gas monkey
hackers the people in this room the

268
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,670
people in this conference we've been in
the cast monkey for IT for a good 20 30

269
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,240
years

270
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,449
we beat the hell out some systems they
have changed and our drivers have

271
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:04,289
changed the stack to change the
performance these OT have hardly looked

272
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:09,270
at it right so we got to have a process
in place we can take our normal approach

273
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,668
run it through a filter and smooth it
out the way that I went and did this was

274
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:22,350
are looking at the configuration files
on these ICS and scale systems

275
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,809
so first step hold the config files and
run the bone on the config files

276
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,320
don't worry you don't need to track me
i'm going to keep pace it's okay

277
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,870
I'm one often stages so we pull this
config files down and you run the

278
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,979
analysis the vulnerability analysis on
the config files as opposed to running

279
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,539
the analysis lives you don't scan the
systems to Palm off to check out there

280
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:49,200
is a system or our group called digital
pond

281
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,799
they've got a ton of checks for this
fantastic check out the site for some

282
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,730
pcap small bunch of other things you can
play what their challenges digital bond

283
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,380
works very very closely with the energy
sector

284
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,220
not so closely with the food sector so
our environment we had planned to use is

285
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,940
pretty extensively for only able to
actually look about ten percent of the

286
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,680
systems but still worth checking we will
also talk to Jabbar and Tom old systems

287
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
like that so I'm sure they're going to
be raising that out

288
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,060
the next thing is to capture some
packets so moving back as these systems

289
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,290
are talking back and forth right we got
an opportunity

290
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,550
each layer of the network to capture
that traffic and analyze the traffic and

291
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,419
look for bones possibly we're not going
to scan when I can inject anything we're

292
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,540
not going to risk the production for
capture those packets and run through a

293
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,639
ball and Skinner all the way this ends
up looking is something like this we can

294
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,910
go ahead and say hey here's all the
systems we found here's the risks . but

295
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,430
they are armed up a bomb and you can
start to see things like oh it detected

296
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,070
modbus detected the siemens protocol

297
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,070
this is probably this type of ice that's
probably that type of the best you can

298
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:03,520
begin to get a little bit closer cut as
to what's running a couple caveats about

299
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,090
this is aa what your traction rods right
much liked Birds

300
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,310
there's like oh we need to do organic
foods that goes first right before we

301
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,370
run the chemical to run the organic
through and we got a cleaning cycle now

302
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,360
we've got the run that we only run every
other week because it's for a special

303
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,379
producer and then we get this other run
that runs the second run in the fourth

304
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,110
run will not the fourth run all the time
you know there's all this complexity

305
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,169
trying to piece together a schedule so
part of the fun factor project

306
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,860
management is to figure out how many of
these runs are going to be operational

307
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,760
at the time we collect these packets
because the more runs their operational

308
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,180
the greater chance you collect more
technology because each one uses a

309
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,040
slightly different process slightly
different set of industrial controls so

310
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,190
we run home and grab the package will
run through a passive owner but it's kim

311
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,910
and this one is through terrible and
list out a whole bunch of technology

312
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,150
that we can start to figure out which
technology is going into which process

313
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,059
he was packaged by the way these
screenshots are not from the client

314
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:05,309
these packets are from samurai STFU you
can grab them off balance if you want to

315
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,620
take a look at the packets you get a
sense

316
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,799
samurais the same guys who do the the
web

317
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,850
hacking you distro this one is
specifically for ICS

318
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,899
so while we're checking it out so Mike
enemy has pulled it down and ran it

319
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,559
through

320
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,770
so now we've we've got an idea what they
have we run

321
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,150
config files we looked at the bombs
there I'll we've done a bunch of that

322
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,570
captures our hopefully catching as many
runs as possible

323
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,799
we got a good idea of what those assets
are the next step is basically old

324
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,158
fashion shoe leather right walking
around walking the production line

325
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:49,710
figure video now and finding she's so
walking around and verifying what these

326
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,730
devices are in getting more Intel out of
that we've got a reasonably good

327
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,080
inventory and then we can do the most
absolute positive painful thing you can

328
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,830
imagine

329
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,240
next to eating a frog and this is again
kudos to my Academy guys who did this

330
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,780
are who actually some of them actually
enjoyed it which was surprising me

331
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,049
maybe we got massacred something I don't
know so basically what you do is you

332
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,908
pull down all the release notes

333
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:18,240
another thing that's kind of interesting
about the difference between IT and ICS

334
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,730
is i.t we've got C B's right which is a
great system when you don't have a code

335
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,470
name and logo on the theme song

336
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,990
we got a way to track the
vulnerabilities and say okay here's what

337
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,490
the bones are here's what they mean in
terms of ICS a lot of these vendors are

338
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,280
not reporting on its not centrally
located so what you end up having to do

339
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,879
is start from the version of running
Annalise versions are 10 20 years old

340
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,510
and start . the release notes and
agreeing all those release notes in the

341
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,190
one central location is everything this
one has found this one at that ball and

342
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,770
the history for the past 20 years as
these vulnerabilities have been

343
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,658
discovered recorded so it's another cut
after we've got the package we identify

344
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:55,770
and walk around

345
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,070
now we're logging the vendor portal and
we do a lot of groundwork

346
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,320
this is what took out the majority of
the time analysis

347
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,689
then we go ahead and talk to people
right and we get the executive by n

348
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,039
which everyone always talks about his be
critical as it is exactly say yeah we

349
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,080
need to know this information we're
gonna fix this we need to do something

350
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,149
with that and you get which I don't
often hear about the buy-in from the

351
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:20,830
silverback gorilla

352
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,639
usually I say so we're back here a lot
depending on how much your insecurities

353
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,990
like oh you mean great

354
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,610
no I don't be great I mean the
silverback gorilla silverback gorilla is

355
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,620
the is the person in the meeting with
the most knowledge and the most

356
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,789
influence and the most humble title at
silverback gorillas are never managers

357
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:44,049
so we're back roads are the men and the
women who are very very quiet in a

358
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:46,960
meeting what everyone else is talking
and at the end they all look at them and

359
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,720
the silverback gorilla ways in and
that's what they do

360
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,570
alright silverback gorillas are the
people who know where all the skeletons

361
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,590
are buried

362
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,590
so we're back to Rose will sit in a
meeting with you in the sea so this is

363
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,070
like here's our controls and here's
everything in we got this and it's all

364
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,340
pretty and then you go out to lunch the
soul Bracker a lot of your friends with

365
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,029
them on the go

366
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,019
yeah that sounds really good and it we
don't follow me those policies and you

367
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,470
know three months ago there's a breach
in six months ago this other guy did

368
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,559
this one thing you won't believe the
silverback girls the one who knows where

369
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,190
all the skeletons are buried we want to
make good friends with silver black

370
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,590
girls in terms of assessment in terms of
remediation the silverback gorilla is

371
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,080
also the one where your sea level goes

372
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
hey we're going to fix this and they
ever goes huh

373
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,460
and then the sea level goes back to the
ivory tower who do they look at

374
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,970
so we're back gorilla and he's like now
they'll slow us down his overall going

375
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,669
to do right to mouth and I think we
overlook the the influencers and ability

376
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:45,940
to have subject matter expert actually
calls the calls

377
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,039
so we find a silverback gorilla we get
some good Intel from them and then we

378
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,299
can deal with surprised when we come
back to the findings are like what do

379
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,950
you mean this is what you're saying

380
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,070
it's always worked this way I don't know
why you want me to change it

381
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,629
everything's fine get the executive
support the silverback gorillas you can

382
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:09,459
get great intel are coming up front and
great momentum when you go to pick sense

383
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,428
alright so i got like five minutes yeah

384
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:16,720
go all right i'm going to jump to the
findings and we will go so asset

385
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,850
inventory 01

386
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,570
they didn't have one which shouldn't
have surprised me

387
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:28,059
anyone here running I tito has a really
good asset inventory yet

388
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,529
no no but I thought maybe in the
manufacturing paying millions of dollars

389
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:36,610
you might have one turns out not so much
but what's also good about this is that

390
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,519
means the asset inventory was something
that we can deliver as part of the

391
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,419
customer

392
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:45,850
what do we find we found eight percent
frick hms and intron thirty percent were

393
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,039
running apto and 76 running Rock will a
be a problem for me

394
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,269
don't have any robots I wanted more
robots the good news for the industry

395
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:59,440
Rockwell is one of the vendors is really
got the security under control and

396
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,279
they're doing a lot of good steps to
start correcting a lot of running rock

397
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,119
wall I was pleased to see that i
mentioned aging technologies here's what

398
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,309
that brought down looks like a few of
them in the past couple years which is

399
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:15,220
interesting because the new ones are all
using web technology I'll get why that's

400
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,080
important in just a moment of some of
them around twelve percent the majority

401
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,178
around 11 15 years this represents a
building boom that happened around the

402
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:26,409
early aughts

403
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:30,429
why that's interesting is that means
you'll be supporting 2000 windows XP the

404
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,659
next 30 years

405
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:37,899
it's not going away ah and he can't so
much of it and the rest of this really

406
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:43,658
really old old old stop six years and
older are another interesting thing in

407
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:48,460
the food industry in addition to being
one largest consumers of of energy in

408
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,919
addition to being one of the largest
consumers of water

409
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,429
they are also one of the largest
consumers and one of the few remaining

410
00:25:54,429 --> 00:26:00,009
buyers of cereal cars there by stacks
and stacks 20 cards still run things and

411
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:00,940
awesome windows

412
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,779
I love it so well sometimes segmentation
doesn't really exist are again much like

413
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,590
the conversation with the wireless
scanners and what not like to segment

414
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,658
your network absolutely segment our
network

415
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:14,429
great

416
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,749
so what's your AC else what do you mean
this will i get to that point

417
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,710
yes but only certain devices awesome

418
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,809
how come all the trap is going well what
do you mean have you singing to your

419
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:28,470
network

420
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,509
absolutely we have no broadcast traffic
really no practice lyrics are seeing

421
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,710
this end up so often times coming out of
school right there like here's what

422
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,460
segmentation as we segment based on VLAN
we segment based on the summit and then

423
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,460
we put in a CL that routes all the
traffic from one to another

424
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,629
all that singing

425
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:52,080
everyone thinks they are no one is so
that's one of the main things is all

426
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,379
this old equipment is basically even
though it's not a flat network around

427
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,658
network still on one network

428
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,960
this is kind of interesting when you
think about third parties because a lot

429
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,220
of third parties come in of soda pop
machines now if you go to buy soda pop

430
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,009
machine come with internet connection
they want to plug in your network is

431
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:08,999
awesome

432
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,029
our cafes want to plug in your network
which is awesome

433
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:15,749
you need the vendors are plugging the
network which is awesome and then able

434
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:16,980
to get all this equipment

435
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,090
some of our bows we found we expected i
like things are clear text and remote

436
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,740
code looks something like this little
sequel injection little bit cross site

437
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,690
scripting this is mostly reflected that
newer technology that is come out the

438
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:37,049
past few years that has lots of web
bones a lot of remote access our denial

439
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,249
of service right

440
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:41,970
I was talking about we can't scan
anything tons and tons and tons of

441
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,149
plaintext passwords very important to
note if you're doing this p kappa

442
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:48,840
analysis are those big ass with your
life you'll get a lot of passwords and

443
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,309
those tall these plants and tons of this
product manipulation right the ability

444
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,090
to get in and manipulate the the
parameters so that you can move the

445
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,668
robot so you can change the temperature
of the boilers

446
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:05,039
so you can change the temperature of the
fridge so now service know we can scan

447
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,669
it

448
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:10,440
one and 10 have ultimately it's the das
right in times of these . x pastures

449
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,530
so once we have all these bonds what do
we do with that if we start in the

450
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,010
beginning by thinking about in terms of
governance we can line it back up with

451
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,570
the business process

452
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,590
this is a horribly ugly slide I know but
if you think about hey here's how the

453
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,250
chicken moves through the planet does a
visitor a Shinto feathering right

454
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,120
it goes ahead and it's spoiled as washes
cuts package store and fries and shipped

455
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,719
have instead of saying and I'd encourage
you guys not only in the food industry

456
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,950
but just in general

457
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,860
instead of saying you know we've got all
these are DDoS is and CS are you know

458
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,040
accesses on this particular

459
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,520
allen-bradley machine this fog machine
is really weird it's got this other

460
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,240
instead of saying all that we can say
look you're boiling and washing is at

461
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,960
risk

462
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,980
we could take it offline while that
means your plant that gets the plant

463
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,040
managers a UH attention like that right

464
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,690
so we take all these poems and we roll
them on up and we talked about in terms

465
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,840
of business process take these phones
are a role model in terms of governance

466
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,600
so i'm not going to read these officer
nest and they make my eyes go cross but

467
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
it's much better to talk in terms of at
the high level

468
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,199
hey here's how we bring together you're
writing your OT based on one central

469
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,520
risk framework under nest and report
along that way so that we can back it up

470
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,690
and not say well wolf said we should fix
this we can say you know according to

471
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,350
nest

472
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,230
here's the rest here which is trying to
hold yourself to standard - and here's

473
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,120
our process with the FDA so those the
bones that's how we reported them up

474
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,800
wrapping it up and taking this talk down
you know food is a modern marvel all the

475
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,580
same vulnerabilities that talk about our
and every one of our manufacturing

476
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,419
plants Detroit are in every one of our
energy plants aren't every one of our

477
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,950
water plants those plants however are
oftentimes a few steps ahead of the food

478
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,100
manufacturing because they're getting
attention because they're getting looked

479
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,730
at

480
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,710
we've had 20 or 30 years as IT folks to
cat can do cool stop and attack windows

481
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,580
and attack linux and attack max we've
not had more than a couple years to

482
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,030
attack the space so because i'm looking
at something new to play with something

483
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,710
new to it and interesting to shine a
light on and get some attention too

484
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,670
i highly encourage you guys to look at
the food in sure and i love that this

485
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,130
talk book ends with lunch

486
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,990
so think about the chickens and the cows
and the vulnerabilities as you're

487
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,280
enjoying your sandwich

488
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,670
I have a great conference i'm going to
be here are for the rest of day that you

489
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,920
want start button thanks so much
