1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:14,460
again

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,869
okay there we go um hello I'm David
shaper and this is not a very highly

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,880
technical talk now i have taught a lot
of technical classes in my career and

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,310
they range from offensive defensive so
we actually break into computers and I

5
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,300
lay out scenarios and we pivot and we do
a whole bunch of really cool stuff it

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,500
just want to do intensive courses so i'm
not going to be talking about any of

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,860
that today we're going to talk about is
basically the unique role that I was and

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,980
when I worked for Walsh college now I
said worked yes that's true

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,699
I don't work there anymore ok I used to
work there I've got I've got a few my

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,320
students up front which is cool because
they respect me enough to be here which

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,190
is awesome even though i left the job
but arm

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:07,380
in the meantime the position itself
happened to lend me to a unique aspect

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,658
of looking at different types of
cultures

14
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,009
now first and foremost I am a hacker I
consider myself a hacker i don't think

15
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,759
i'm a skilled is like Ben tan or any of
those only really cool guys like david

16
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,090
kennedy and all those other people but i
will say that i do understand the

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,159
concepts and my hero is like at school
notice who is actually one of the guys

18
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,060
from sand setups and a lot of really
cool course works there with a lot of

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,590
really talented people and when I built
classes i try to model the model on this

20
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:45,060
close to sands as I could but with that
said we were working on at walsh college

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,369
since that was brought up I wasn't gonna
bring them up

22
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,979
that's ok but we were working and within
its still in process on a cyber security

23
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,229
certification the first ever in the
world that we know of or auto model

24
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,658
vehicles and that's going to happen here
in Michigan and we're hopefully

25
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,539
it was scheduled to go get some time and
the fall if you're interested in stuff

26
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,708
like that you know it's not just campus
hack and it's also wireless it's

27
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,580
everything

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:21,269
and so what we have to do is a full-time
faculty member was find out all these

29
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,230
different types of advisors in the
industry that we could talk to and some

30
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,160
of these advisors I knew before I even
took the position and some of these

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,359
advisors

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,060
i also met along the way and it was a
very unique perspective so that's what

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm going to talk about today and again
and i'm from that that that background

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,250
now for 18 years before i joined walsh
college I was actually a system at blue

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,370
team person and very fascinated with the
actual routine type of technology and

36
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,400
the red team take the technology is is
really cool because from the aspect

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,549
before i had a formalized education and
IT security I never really realized how

38
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:11,910
fascinated I was with cyber security and
security in general are you know I was

39
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,389
going through the the emulsions of
venous system admin and stuff but I was

40
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,060
also trying to push the system i was
also always trying to make it more

41
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,709
secure and I never really considered
myself more of a security person so it

42
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,269
would be in front of all of you

43
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,540
like I am today arm is like an honor to
me to be here so I I don't consider

44
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,730
myself like a huge awesome speaker on of
cybersecurity but i guess i might be I

45
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,440
mean my students may argue that arm six
years i spent teaching offensive

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,250
defensive and i taught at different
universities and colleges around Detroit

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,510
everything was done by word of mouth and
I never applied for any of those jobs

48
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,578
until they ask me to like some it's not
you get home and said okay we want to

49
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,329
hire you and we're we're looking for you
so currently looking for opportunities

50
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,700
out there and overall views in this
presentation are of my own and not of

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,470
any past or future employer

52
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,150
ok these are my observation arm
basically what we want to do is one of

53
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,660
the fine culture we want to look at the
stereotypes and differences

54
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,950
we're going to look at the similarities
between

55
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,899
the two cultures the hacker culture and
the corporate automotive culture and

56
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,010
we're also going to talk about cultural
clashes or what I call crashes tongue in

57
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,880
cheek and we're also going to you talk
about some countermeasures and things

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,719
along the way as I . did identify those
crashes and then we're going to look at

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,400
a big history fan

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,599
ok we're going to look at the history
and why it's significant today and

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,360
things that have happened along the way
and we're just high that into automotive

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,350
culture

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,990
so with that said I don't know if you
ever seen time boy have you

64
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,150
ok awesome one person so this is this is
a scene from Tommy Boy

65
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,960
and basically when I was sitting at the
table at one of them I can't name that

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,638
the automotive manufacturer that we were
at Lauren's sitting at the table

67
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,250
I immediately had this flash of this
scene and who was Tommy Boy

68
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,630
I was Tommy Boy ok and I basically I'm
talking to a corporate bigwig and uh oh

69
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,740
let us see basically what happens here

70
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:28,419
hopefully it will play for me up hold
and technical difficulty

71
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,090
that's okay we can work it out

72
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,200
our new brake pads are really cool

73
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,969
you're not going to believe it like oh
let's say you're driving along the road

74
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,530
with your family and you're driving
along I was that all of a sudden there's

75
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,780
a truck tire in the middle of the road
and you hit the brakes

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,929
whoa that was close yeah

77
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,539
now let's see what happens when you're
driving with the other guys brake pads

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,220
you're driving a lie having a lot
outside the kids are young back seat

79
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,820
I'm gonna be a daddy not now damaged
tire

80
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:29,739
I there's a clip and your family
screaming oh my god were burning alive

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,229
no I can't feel my leg meat wagon

82
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:42,040
we make it . says oh my god you guys in
the corner

83
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,360
you gonna stop stop well all because you
want to save a couple extra pennies and

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,660
to me it doesn't get out now

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,170
do you validate now

86
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,970
ok so that clip

87
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:11,260
although humorous there is some truth to
that in a way in regards to ok i'm not

88
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,280
that bad of a speaker

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,429
first of all when I'm talking to them
and the meat and actually want a lot

90
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,490
better than that which is good to say
but with that said here's the thing is

91
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,490
and the hacker culture isn't out like
that

92
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,050
however when we shut down vehicles on
roads and stop and we're not doing

93
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,140
proper testing in and the enclosed
facilities that will make guarantee that

94
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,880
people get hurt or injured that can
cause some problems and you can see

95
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,480
where corporate may see review you a
little bit different more like tommy boy

96
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,680
in a way because you're being a little
bit more careless

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,130
however there's reasons why we do those
things as well and we have to we have to

98
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,520
talk or address those

99
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,270
so culture itself now here's the thing
is i said i'm going to talk about

100
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,289
culture

101
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:01,430
well how simple is this video back in
nineteen fifty four

102
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,509
there was a group of scientists came
together and so we're going to define

103
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:10,669
culture back in nineteen ninety-two they
still figured out that after a hundred

104
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:13,669
and sixty to a hundred and sixty two
definitions

105
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,830
they could not agree on one definition
of what cultural lesson so I'm talking

106
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,930
about culture and I'm gonna have to
define that

107
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,409
just like I'm gonna have to define
hackers because it's both why did indeed

108
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:25,219
right

109
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,470
I like a cissp so cultural consists of
the derivatives of experience more or

110
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,979
less organized learned and created by
the individuals of the population

111
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,240
including those images and improvements
of their interpretations means

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,829
transmitted from the past generations
from contemporaries or perform or

113
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:46,760
individuals themselves so we see this in
the conference's that we attend we have

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,970
b-sides we have converged we have aircon
we had that kind we have all these

115
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,089
different types of power conferences we
have black hat and stuff like that we're

116
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,480
going to talk about that a little bit
more but each one of those conferences

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,459
has its own culture

118
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,349
ok so when we talk about the hacker
culture itself

119
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,270
overall we have to start at the very
essence of the definition that was a

120
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,220
part of a railroad club at a major
university a long time ago and that's

121
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,260
where the true form a hacker was termed
and that basically that term means noble

122
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,800
explore it was somebody that can extend
the capabilities of the system and I

123
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,680
always like to point that out and the
reason why is because there's culture

124
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,089
class around that ok

125
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,300
obviously there's also the visions of
those different types of hacker culture

126
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,770
is black hat type of people that like to
go there and they'll pay the extra money

127
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,250
and so they're going to duck on because
they don't want to be around the defcon

128
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,820
people

129
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,180
oh and by the way the defcon people may
not want to be around them okay

130
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,500
depending on who they are

131
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,550
there's ethical vs unethical there's a
converse versa law enforcement

132
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,170
the subject is both wide in the

133
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,250
and due to the diversity and experienced
abuse that vary at different cultures

134
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,180
and different people that are presented
and the organizers and stuff like that

135
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,019
it all plays into that culture of those
types of people so for the

136
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,630
classification the hackers for this
presentation

137
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,939
what we're really going to focus on is
we're going to use like DEFCON as one

138
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,760
form of hacker and the earth for the
term of hacker and then black hat me

139
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,649
represent more of the corporation

140
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:23,360
now those of you that are not familiar
with black hat black hat is basically a

141
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,290
less expensive

142
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,410
there's only a couple hundred bucks
instead of a couple thousand it happens

143
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,230
the week after earth

144
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:38,000
yeah def con happens a week after the
the black hat and I think basically

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,959
black hat you're going to pay a lot more
money for the sea

146
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,160
about the same presentations and over at
another conference this year that i was

147
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,660
at Huntsville Alabama where I accepted
Walsh colleges designation for

148
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,790
cybersecurity excellence

149
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,930
basically I talked to an individual is a
head of security at a company and he

150
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,390
says yeah I go to that it's a black hat
now i don't i don't really go to DEFCON

151
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,790
is a lie because they die they die their
Mohawks and stop over at at Def Con and

152
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't really get into that and I'm
like oh ok that's interesting

153
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,829
you know I'm kind of cheap I'm like a
tuner box per ticket

154
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:19,939
I really goes to the black is that it's
a duck on campus especially since it's

155
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,060
basically the same types of talks that
are given

156
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,910
so here are the corporate cultures are
clashes that I've saw observe first of

157
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,930
all one is the media versus the hacker
versus the corporation this is a very

158
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,250
real clash

159
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,390
that's out there that's the perception
it's a serial type and we can talk about

160
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,430
how to work with that huge one here also
is open source port via closed source

161
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,699
ok so we have information sharing on one
hand and we're all about information

162
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:53,420
sharing and that's where the defcon
group where the corporate group or more

163
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,490
like hey wait a minute i don't know
picture that

164
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,880
okay and I've seen that there's the
hands-on aspect

165
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,410
there's also the unbound versus the
bottom of the boundaries that are

166
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,089
limited Pete's people are limited to arm
and there's also a communication

167
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,560
response is also hacking tools that
dipper that i have served in our

168
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,359
conversations that was pretty cool

169
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,570
and one of the manufacturers we're
talking about what we're doing with with

170
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,330
different types of tools and they're
like we don't use that we use this

171
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,990
well the difference was that tools like
a couple thousand dollars three thousand

172
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,100
dollars and that's like way it does like
the same thing basically but yeah it's a

173
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,020
left right here you know and it's a lot
more efficient to but you pay for it

174
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,430
test improving concept legal concerns
and then there's also the ethics that

175
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:44,270
are the concerns so culture clash number
one media versus a hacker culture so

176
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,420
back in February i gave a convert our
conference talk about in in some of that

177
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,250
worked into this presentation

178
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,730
what this presentation of all - it's
about 15 minutes and I talked a little

179
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,079
bit about some of these different types
of stereotypes of media put out there

180
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,739
one of the things is like heck to the
future this is what it says this is how

181
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,760
care crackers and car makers are
battling for control for your ride or

182
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,260
her hackers and card makers are battling
for control and it's like wait a minute

183
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,529
you know I'm not battle on anybody for
control of your car i really don't care

184
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,490
ok i just want to go ahead and play with
it a little bit and try to figure it out

185
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,070
figure out how it works and see what I
can do with it

186
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,270
ok and that's like the hacker mentality
but what the media is actually out there

187
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,740
and in this one little added this one
little snippet of which was like the

188
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:38,240
major banner on one a major article from
a major news publication car and driver

189
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,089
on this is right up there and I actually
sort everywhere or source everything on

190
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,550
here in reference it because that's
where I was trained and I train my

191
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,939
students that way too because the
validity but anyway that in essence is

192
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,990
not true

193
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,529
ok it's nobody's really battling for
anything

194
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,920
you know the the main thing is like as a
hacker

195
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,579
we're trying to save like there's
problems with your systems and we want

196
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:10,069
to go ahead and we want to we we want to
expose them but not in a way that you

197
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,560
think we want to expose on we want to
expose them in a way we want to actually

198
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,400
fix them

199
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,170
ok we want to fix that's all we want to
do you get inside the hacker mine and

200
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,890
you understand it the true hacker in my
humble opinion is the noble explorer

201
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,079
we want to fix their fixers we are
creators were makers and that's what we

202
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,949
do

203
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:34,219
but the media has painted more like the
Grim Reaper

204
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,820
we always have to have a hood on you can
see her face that's not true I'm up here

205
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,779
I've got its got a suit I've got a nice
shirt and I had nice shirt and shit

206
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,990
Sudan for a long time you can ask my
students have a pretty good dresser

207
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:52,970
ok and on that's not always true so
anyway we want to detect failure and

208
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,290
Henry Ford said at the baths and we've
talked about different types of hackers

209
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,730
he was a hacker himself ok he took a lot
of different types of systems that he

210
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,850
knew about he put them together and you
basically formulated the car

211
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,660
the automotive repair and basically said
failure is simply the opportunity to

212
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,360
begin again this time more intelligently

213
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,079
so that means ok we found the problem
but we can move on and we can go ahead

214
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,449
and fix that and that's the whole point
of that

215
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:22,370
so when we talk about media versus the
hacker culture where is the media when

216
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,899
we actually have and I've had people
that are ex-military that are going

217
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,470
through my courses i've had people that
are police officers those types of

218
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,160
people are learning the same offensive
and defensive types of tools that we are

219
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,810
actually putting out there today

220
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,260
the engineers the people over at some of
the meter manufacturers are doing the

221
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,160
same thing

222
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:47,719
ok so there's internal hackers in our
organizations and so we have the idea of

223
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,990
a cyber ninja anybody ever heard that
term cyber ninja

224
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,699
ok cyber ninja is really a person that
works for an organization and there

225
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,689
out there they could be the Red Team
Blue Team person but they're constantly

226
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:08,980
trying to improve the actual the actual
security within that organization and

227
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,399
basically the concept of the
entrepreneur itself is similar to an

228
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,389
entrepreneur

229
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:21,759
except for its something instead instead
of actually going ahead and making your

230
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,230
your way out in the world and certain
your own business you

231
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,100
you're helping the organization from the
internal view and you're actually

232
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,499
helping that that organization from
within and from that standpoint the

233
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:42,220
entrepreneur behaves a lot like an
entrepreneur and they are they encourage

234
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,459
ideas and the work of all products the
company that you work for

235
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:49,238
they're motivated creative and able to
think outside of the box and hackers are

236
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,679
a lot like that

237
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,959
ok it's the same definition sound
familiar motivated creative and ability

238
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,099
to think outside the box

239
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,439
so a lot of these organizations and what
I've observed is that over at the

240
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:07,148
organizations that I did speak to is
that they have internal hackers they

241
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,339
have these people are like us

242
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,609
in fact some of those people might be in
our audience right now some of those

243
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,500
people actually might be in other areas
of this bill then

244
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,079
ok I a dom they are hackers in that
sense and they still attend the same

245
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,359
conferences and they might be helping
out with the media versus the hacker

246
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,500
culture resolution while stereotype that
doesn't help any of us so don't okay

247
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,970
here's the thing is i go to conferences
and the conference's that been through

248
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,970
like Kirk on and b-sides and stuff like
that

249
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,350
these you say well the car hacker
manufacturers

250
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,678
you know there is a they did this

251
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,269
well this sucks you know I don't really
like this or whatever about that what

252
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:57,399
about the about the car manufacturers
themselves will realize that when you're

253
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,559
talking about that you're talking about
those individuals that are actually

254
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,918
working in an organization and those
people that work in the organization

255
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,639
again or hackers like us they take a lot
of pride in her work that they do but

256
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:11,439
due to the fact the of legal
responsibilities and obligations they

257
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,260
can't go out there and disclose what
they're working on

258
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,799
ok they have families they have children
they have to make sure that those that

259
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,399
they're going to get their paycheck at
the end of the day and my observation is

260
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:24,610
this that they know a lot

261
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,729
ok they may not be with daily not be
able to share a lot of information and

262
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,980
because they can't share that
information

263
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,610
we're going to get onto another type of
another type of culture crash but

264
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,699
because they can't do that they it's
like the whole organization gets a bad

265
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,179
rap

266
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,049
and now let's take it back a little bit
why can't the organization's why can't

267
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:50,408
those organizations go ahead and share
that type of information

268
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:56,260
we'll talk about that ok so there are
employees that care

269
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,980
those of us that had interviews with
reporters need to continue to point out

270
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,539
that there are good people everywhere
that hackers is a good term it's

271
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:10,539
something that we can do you know for
ourselves for our community is to let

272
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:15,190
people know that there's people still
out there that are ethical now what this

273
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,789
comes back down to is something I like
to call the art of perception

274
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,139
ever since a very early ages of our
existence ever since we were born we

275
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:26,439
made up our whole world and basically
what surrounds us

276
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,269
okay and basically we form different
types of perceptions face off of the the

277
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:35,409
ideas and beliefs that we hold whether
we're corporate or whether where they

278
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:39,190
have her and the corporate people are
actually probably looking at us more

279
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,110
like irresponsible

280
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,549
ok not all of us are irresponsible we
have to remind that not all of us in the

281
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:50,620
hacker community will go out there and
go ahead and shut down cars you know on

282
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,158
a freeway and stuff like that there are
people that are

283
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,280
that are out there and they do the dew
test

284
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,580
craig smith i know for a fact open
garages

285
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,230
he actually test with in his garage and
he makes sure that nobody's going to get

286
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,690
hurt so there's there's ways to do it

287
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,419
okay and there's a lot of people that
are interested in doing that way there's

288
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,860
also different types of programs we can
utilize and different on those programs

289
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,610
will allow us through to go ahead and
pause and perform some of the different

290
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,879
types of tests is if we're doing it on a
real car and some of us do that

291
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,220
so media versus cultural resolution
there's a contribution versus a

292
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,570
measurement part of it

293
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,110
oh and now this comes into play whether
you're in the hacker community a

294
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,158
corporate community

295
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,549
remember what I said it's like it's all
made up from the beginning and from when

296
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:42,559
we first started to receive our own
beliefs and values and that whole system

297
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,379
basically are there is also something
that works with us and against us

298
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,460
there's the ID of contribution now when
you're contributing to an organization

299
00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:00,409
to an idea or and you know whether it's
that the hackers or the corporate itself

300
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:06,470
then basically you are going ahead and
add value to that to that that entity by

301
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,380
that point on the the thing we have to
get rid of is the measurement the

302
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,380
measurement is like okay I'm better than
you

303
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,070
I am measure my success based off of
yours

304
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,539
ok that's the stuff that tears us all
apart the hacker community also has to

305
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:28,549
realize just like the corporate
community that in order to signal to

306
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,629
succeed together we have to look at it
from a view of contribution not from the

307
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,580
view of measurement and that's very
important because we want to be the team

308
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,299
that works together we don't want to be
the people that are actually going out

309
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,480
there breaking up relationships and
causing a lot of strife

310
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,539
so open source

311
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,080
well open source really involves the
very epicenter trust and from trust if

312
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
you can build that trust with the
organization from a contribution

313
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,179
standpoint then basically what happens
is that you will have communication

314
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,980
innovation transparency

315
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,690
all that stuff will follow ok and some
of it is somewhat sometimes the

316
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,830
transparency again cause of it because
legal says we can't share this type of

317
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,790
information transparency may not always
be there with the corporation

318
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,350
it depends on the corporate culture
which is a subset of that you know that

319
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,620
community in which we're trying to help
out

320
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,489
so Charlie Miller he's got a couple
quotes up here he says if it says you

321
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:34,880
don't disclose what we're talking about
the GMC or the GM this culture program

322
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,429
how many people know about that for site
for cyber security vehicles ok

323
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,419
GM program basically they came out there
want the key

324
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,780
i think it was around january this year
2016

325
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,460
they came out and they said okay we
cannot forget offer a program where we

326
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,660
will make it okay for you to the
school's vulnerabilities to us by the

327
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,169
way there's no monetary reward for that
got I'm hoping that they'll actually add

328
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:04,610
that in to get some motivation for
people to actually try to make some

329
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,168
money off of this but basically what
Charlie Miller saying up there in that

330
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:14,960
suite that I saw , come across is that
all it's saying is we're not going to

331
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,130
sue you

332
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,880
as long as you don't disclose before we
actually try to fix it

333
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,410
and here's the problem this open source

334
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,980
ok we're talking about open source
here's a problem we fought in the hacker

335
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:34,040
community we find problems with the
system we report it to the vendor and

336
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,149
the vendor doesn't do anything about it
and we wait six months

337
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,510
does nothing about it we wait a year
does nothing about it and how is it ever

338
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,510
going to get fixed and that's from the
hacker community itself

339
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,429
the hacker community itself is like late
at if I don't disclose this like right

340
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,049
away then it's not going to get fixed

341
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:57,410
I don't disclose and within a reasonable
amount of time it's not going to be

342
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:05,330
fixed so armed with it said arm
basically that's culture crashing over

343
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,799
to we tend to be willing to share with
others and hold the same passions

344
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:13,920
exception is basically when money is the
motivation factor

345
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,730
and there it involves like 0 days and
different types of things like that a no

346
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,000
day out there as you know that you can
make a lot of money off of it

347
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,500
you know a lot of companies might only
give you 10,000 but again it's

348
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,530
exponentially more if you go to a black
market you try to sell something like

349
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,190
that

350
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,180
and on that depends on your ethical
alignment your financial situation and

351
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:39,060
everything but def con for example you
know Spurs willing to share that type of

352
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,669
information

353
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,230
there's parties and you know this people
you know that will stay up all night

354
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,100
work with you and share with you to
facilitate understanding for different

355
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,159
types of ways to break into systems and
how to make it work

356
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,040
now that does not work so much with a
corporate culture on open source is the

357
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,320
theme for the most part on b-sides and
cons etc all clear examples of open

358
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,159
source information those outside of our
community may not see that entirely as

359
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,790
good as power is distributed and thus
can be abused

360
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:18,480
ok so basically what I'm saying there is
that even though we're sharing this

361
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,180
information we think it's very good
thing there's a lot of people out there

362
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,660
that realize that we're by distributing
this to somebody

363
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:31,050
those people may have a negative x
negative problem intentions you know i

364
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,090
may use it for the wrong things

365
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,129
so that's where the corporate clash
comes then we're armed with the

366
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,340
exceptions of Local Motors wiki speed
and some others

367
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,620
basically they believe more in the coral
closed-source tends to be more

368
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,979
tight-lipped about what they can do and
what they're working on and a lot of

369
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,180
times this comes down to from what I
understand is the actual lawyer's advice

370
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,940
in the company's the lawyers are
basically sand

371
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,450
hey like we're not going to allow you to
say this because or give this

372
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,070
information opera publishes codes
because if you do we're enabling

373
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,740
somebody to actually cause an accident

374
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,120
ok and that's a liability in our part
and if that happens you're going to get

375
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,870
fired

376
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,500
okay because we can't because your
liability at that point so it comes

377
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,700
route very real

378
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,950
so our hackers tend to resent this as we
are wholeheartedly believe in that

379
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,240
to make systems better through community
effort codes for campus except or may

380
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,529
not be published and thus requires just
using techniques like buzzin but the

381
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,139
g-pack shows that doesn't works fine

382
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:39,120
ok so we can figure this out are so
heightened codes only slows down the

383
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,250
attack and it won't stop it

384
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,100
and there's a there's an interesting
point here at like it I was hoping

385
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,299
Frankenmuth Michigan and actually
meeting with somebody and across the

386
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,379
table the guy actually started speaking
to me and he started telling me about

387
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,380
how he works for automotive manufacturer

388
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,090
well I find out he's actually work in
like with can boss he's actually working

389
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,230
with the vehicle security and stuff like
that so I started talking to him about

390
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,389
it and his his whole conversation with
me there was very tight left

391
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:13,709
this is this is from my personal
experience he said basically was like

392
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,970
there's no way

393
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,769
hackers can I can do anything to the
cars that they don't know enough

394
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,689
this is before the g-pack ok they don't
know enough about the systems is not

395
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,409
published out there for them to learn it
because they keep it that way okay

396
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:34,408
I think it was three or four months
later we all we all seen wired magazine

397
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:35,639
we saw the video

398
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:38,760
the Jeep get shut down on the freeway
and stuff like that

399
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,250
it pushed the envelope ok and what I
don't know that's it i'm not trying to

400
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,320
take sides here and that's right to say
what Chris and and what Charlie did was

401
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,620
bad i follow them and and you know i'm
not trying to say that that what

402
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,459
automotive is doing is is great or it's
bad either

403
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm just pointing out facts ok the facts
are it got shut down

404
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,019
the facts are I wasn't able to get any
information out of this guy

405
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:11,760
fast forward another six months to a
year i was sitting across the table from

406
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,500
him in a conference room at one of the
major manufacturers and the prototype

407
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,399
lab in the lab where they test the
Securities and stuff like that

408
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:22,549
which is another paradigm shift for me
because when i walked in i thought it'd

409
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:25,039
be all glitzy and everything and it was
very doll

410
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,729
look in the seventies ish you know I
figured they have like especially like

411
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:32,389
in the security area or something like
that like hi and talk that it would look

412
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,959
like all

413
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,710
oh pretty but it didn't you know arm but
that just shows you the big hack is the

414
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,779
the the big challenge here so here's the
thing that happened like seven days ago

415
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:50,450
this stuff continues to happen ok so
this is real here now are basically BMW

416
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:56,029
had about six months and 20 days to
disclose it and the person that research

417
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:00,979
the there's a cross-site scripting
vulnerability with web page and another

418
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:05,149
one with the car entertainment system
that came out about seven days ago and

419
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:10,939
he finally disclosed it while he made it
an issue now the automotive manufacturer

420
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,080
has to fix it

421
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,509
so here's the problem ok the problem is
from the hackers mind from the hacker

422
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:18,289
standpoint

423
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,619
why are you making us do this why aren't
you fixing it

424
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:26,299
ok we disclose it to you but you have to
wait and so we have to do something

425
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,599
you're holding our feet to the fire you
think that they like to do this that

426
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,889
they like to go out

427
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:34,820
you waited six months before he release
this by the way he didn't want to go out

428
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,189
there he didn't want to have to say okay
I'm going to disclose these

429
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,099
vulnerabilities out there he just wanted
to fixed

430
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:43,369
that's the true motive of a hacker ok

431
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:48,080
and from that standpoint so how do you
curve that is it to make different types

432
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,369
of challenges and opportunities for the
actual hackers in a way that that you

433
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:57,918
say okay well you know what sign this
sign this waiver form and you know what

434
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,080
as long as you don't disclose we want to
you

435
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,619
what's the difference between doing that
and doing this it's really not given any

436
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,689
more of it at all to the hacker

437
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,440
so it's a culture clash and it's like so
there's going to be some kind of real

438
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,549
skin in the game

439
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:15,320
ok there's got to be some kind of the
hackers do things for reasons okay

440
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,678
number one is they usually want to make
a name for themselves

441
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,739
you know our number-two money is the two
biggest things so you work on those give

442
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,929
some recognition get some money

443
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,280
you know people might actually disclosed
more but again when they disclosed

444
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,879
don't expect them to sit on it some some
people won't sit on there

445
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,300
they want to fix so that's the crash

446
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,260
why open source while all technology
blue prints and patterns available

447
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,649
sounds like a fantasy with this
companies that are actually doing that

448
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,610
Tesla OS vehicle ten-thousand-dollar car
concept

449
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,770
it's already out there ok more
experimentation and creativity will take

450
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,889
place more innovation among third
parties hackers expanded capabilities

451
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,100
fix the weaknesses to be surprised what
you can do

452
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,449
ok good thing is there are smaller
alliances

453
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,080
there were major manufacturers are
working together such as open source so

454
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,409
there there's the open automotive
Alliance and I don't know if you've ever

455
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,990
heard that anybody here that here in
person

456
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,490
ok the maybe two but arm open

457
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,080
automotive Alliance is basically there
to support android devices in these

458
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,909
computations and systems and through the
connected vehicle and the major

459
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,700
manufacturers are actually collaborating
together on that

460
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,690
ok they're not out so it's not all black
and white like you see in these

461
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,490
conferences all they don't talk

462
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,400
they don't I got open some of these some
of these speeches they talk about

463
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,580
culture and they they kind of make about
black and white well they can learn open

464
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,720
source wrong

465
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,320
they can learn how to share better from
and I walk right out I'm like - there

466
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,280
they are

467
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,720
they are ok it's you don't have enough
knowledge to realize that they're not

468
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,090
you haven't done enough research and
here you are up in the kind you're

469
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,350
talking about this stuff

470
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:04,370
it doesn't make much sense ok so we also
have to be completely open to the public

471
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,709
or the world with in order to attract
the top talent as pointed out by the

472
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,370
head of tests lot and that's something
that the head of the CEO of Tesla side

473
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,040
is like we want to be open to the world
we want everybody to see what we're

474
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,730
doing

475
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,410
so that we can try to get the top talent
in here we want those hackers we want

476
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,490
those people to help us design systems
and secure them different concept

477
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,910
it's almost like flipping it upside down
the good thing is there's a lot of

478
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,250
positive motivation going on out there

479
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,610
here in the big three right in this
right right here right now and they're

480
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,540
learning this

481
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:41,300
they are armed chrysler fiat you guys
see in the last last past week you've

482
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,590
got a tweet from one of my students my
former students basically he said hey

483
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,189
you know Fiats offering up to $1,500
awesome

484
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,970
finally we have some monetary reward ok
could be better

485
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,110
hopefully but it's a good start ok

486
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:02,179
it was a great start to back in January
when GM went out and said hey we're

487
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,560
going to try to do something we're going
to try to create a program so I don't

488
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,800
want to like downplay any of these
things i think all these are positive

489
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,169
baby steps in the right direction

490
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,130
are they an end goal oh I'm sure the
companies will go ahead and improve on

491
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,510
those as they see that as they want to
meet expectations as they want to make

492
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,860
sure that the vehicle is secure for
people for future your future years

493
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,919
come packing for tools vs legality

494
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,420
what I've learned is you know this is
this is funny because I one else is

495
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,090
searching through Charlie's a news feet

496
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,990
he basically says as a professional car
hacker I don't need a tool beyond

497
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,320
vehicle spy and ecomme cat

498
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,889
we really so but i'm ready to see what
I'm missing

499
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,670
and you said a lot you know he's he's
talking about vehicle spy and stuff like

500
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,360
that

501
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,909
well does anybody know how much vehicle
spy cost in this room I looked it up

502
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,420
about twenty five hundred dollars three
thousand dollars who's got that much

503
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,780
money to spend on hacking your vehicle
now right from the get-go

504
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,260
there there isn't that much the great
thing is you know Craig Smith has a

505
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,300
great book and we're using it

506
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:14,570
we're using that kind of is the the the
roadmap arm for the formerly Walsh's

507
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,080
using it for the road map for the second
cyber security certificate program and

508
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,449
not try to push it but again he brought
it up

509
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:26,120
so what I'm trying but what I'm saying
is there's a lot of good little tools

510
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,219
that we can utilize in there if you want
to learn that stuff

511
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,810
ok arm there's there's open source tools
that Craig published he's got videos on

512
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,330
the web and how to use those different
types of tools and all that other stuff

513
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,350
and some of these tools that you that
you need

514
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,449
I mean they're pretty much free it all
you have to do is buy like the

515
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:46,739
the the equipment to plug in your camp
boss and actually start working from

516
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,178
there which it could be anywhere from
300 to 400 box by the way yeah

517
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,429
automotive manufacturers and stuff and
tools basically they've got when I went

518
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,099
there I was like okay I read correctly
you know i was reading some of craig

519
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,670
smith blocks I talked to a lot of people
before I met with the automotive

520
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,339
manufacturers I get there and they're
like telling me like all the different

521
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:09,540
types of tools that they use and there's
actually there's another one that's like

522
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,070
canoeing kayaking

523
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,980
- is actually a lot of money and save
another twenty five hundred dollars

524
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,280
three thousand dollars to recant boss
and kayak is like free

525
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,990
this is tongue-in-cheek it was it was it
was a play on and on

526
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,790
ok we know you got this really cool to
open I can make a kayak that the less

527
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,500
morning and and we can still utilize
that and yeah when we were when we got

528
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,760
there basically it was like ok they had
like basically the you know the Cadillac

529
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,300
of tools everything I mean it was just
like you

530
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:43,670
that is so cool yeah you know not
everybody can afford that so more

531
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,650
solutions to demand respect

532
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,960
we need to gain respect grants are good
in different conferences and stuff like

533
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,850
that but solutions are better

534
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,880
I mean if we could talk about some of
the things like like what I'm talking

535
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,900
about right now

536
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,960
I mean how to pick some if you have any
cyber ninjas

537
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,780
remember we talked about cyber inches
you all know what that is now right

538
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,990
those are like the hackers inside that
are really good at what they're doing

539
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,350
please don't micromanage them that's the
worst thing you can do they'll walk away

540
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:15,650
ok cyber ninjas know that okay they got
skills and stuff like that but the big

541
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,120
thing is like they're working on stock
and you know a lot of times and it takes

542
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,100
a long time to maybe fuzz or I don't
forget how many rounds and maybe hundred

543
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,569
something something like that

544
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,070
upwards around just to go ahead and try
to get codes out of a system

545
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,760
you know and try to freakin figure out
like how everything works but you know

546
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,580
if somebody's right there right there
but you know and they're sitting there

547
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,940
up all day and night working i can stop
that doesn't bode well

548
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,080
it's like you're working your butt off
or not then at the end of the day and

549
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,040
what are you getting

550
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,000
where is it where is it where is it you
know

551
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,740
well I guess I'm not fittin so I'll see
you later corporations recognize and

552
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:01,819
give those that find 0 days issues given
recognition give the hackers proper

553
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,130
money and money

554
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,360
preferably most importantly realize that
we have a common goal and that's to

555
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,230
hopefully create a safer technology and
safer environment for everybody

556
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,550
we need to break down barriers we need
to learn from each other engineers and

557
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,530
cybersecurity professionals together

558
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:24,710
ok we're both hackers in this community
in a way I mean somebody builds it

559
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,740
we go through and we look at it we try
to reverse engineer it to try to figure

560
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,549
out how it all works and then we try to
do really crazy things to it

561
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:37,370
listen without prejudice that means go
ahead and try to figure out what the

562
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,270
hacker is trying to say don't just go up
there and say okay you're careless and

563
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:47,680
throw out all his finance some people
have a very good . arm and you know what

564
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,509
sometimes you have to divorce your
feelings from it and that's something

565
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,910
that I think that engineers could
probably fine

566
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,750
it happens pretty well naturally
engineers usually are very analytical

567
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,150
and that's why they're engineers anyway
speak with commonality there is you know

568
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,450
nobody is better than anyone else
remember talking about the measurement

569
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,960
you know let's talk about like how we
can do things together how we can fix

570
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,670
things how we can make it better

571
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,569
the human mind is wonderful things so
let's go ahead and use it together

572
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:19,960
because when you and add them all
together it's gonna be a heck of a lot

573
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,740
better

574
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,540
various stereotypes won't move us ahead
but you know working in collaboration

575
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,099
well conferences are

576
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,849
hey but action Wednesday at the end

577
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:35,170
so let's go ahead and follow up the
Restless talk by talking about some

578
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,170
history so history

579
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,280
who's this guy and then who are these
guys does anybody know

580
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,359
audience interaction time i will not
move forward

581
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,808
anybody I don't know

582
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:54,730
ok are you sure anybody back there again
read you know

583
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,920
okay okay well you know who you know
Tommy Boy so I figured I pequeno

584
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,480
ok so this is Roger virtually and he's a
physical engineer and this is charlie

585
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,609
miller and Chris elastic lot

586
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:15,069
so Roger is famous for actually
consulted with NASA

587
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:20,380
back in the eighties and well you know
Chris and Charlie Miller hopefully

588
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,510
because they're the ones that actually
did the g-pack right so it's kind of

589
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,140
cool

590
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,670
what do they have in common here's a bad
thing is like a lot of people don't

591
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:36,760
think about what the engineer has in
common with the actual hackers and this

592
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,710
is why I'm trying to get to right here

593
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,750
what do you think that they have in
common anybody know nobody i'm paying

594
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,690
for this conference you tell me the
answers that

595
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,849
I'll tell you what they have in common
Roger board usually and these two

596
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,980
gentlemen right here on the side

597
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:01,000
both found flaws and vehicle systems ok
people try talking to manufacturers and

598
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,280
they tried to get them to fix those
systems

599
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,220
ok now these guys over here did not just
go out run out in the school's right

600
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,480
away either

601
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,109
ok they waited some time and then they
went disclosed to the public

602
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:19,569
Roger boys really again he tried his
best to stop the space shuttle going up

603
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,579
what was the results well Roger rodas
memo back in january nineteen

604
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:29,829
eighty-five concern in the fatal design
in a vehicle a rocket booster asking

605
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:35,859
NASA to go ahead and delay the actual
launch anybody lived through that I did

606
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,150
it was pretty mad

607
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,450
it was pretty bad there's a teacher on
there and I remember being in school at

608
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,529
the time and it was like very horrifying
especially the teachers that another

609
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,140
teacher had just blown up in a rocket

610
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,118
ok in January 2896 over a year later
okay

611
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,609
basically or maybe less than a year I
don't know the the actual month also it

612
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:00,640
was January 9500 over a year later

613
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,020
basically the Challenger exploded Roger
and his colleagues tried to stop the

614
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,470
launch

615
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:10,419
after confirmation launch date and Roger
testified found himself shun by

616
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,660
colleagues managers and eventually
resigned from his position as a physical

617
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,740
engineer

618
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,419
why because he did the ethical thing he
tried to tell people what was wrong with

619
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,470
the system

620
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,160
it's very similar what we're going
through today we try to tell people

621
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,609
what's wrong with the car and all of a
sudden we get Sean we get you know we we

622
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,740
have maybe colleagues even managers come
after us why are you doing this why are

623
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,740
you saying this why do you what do you
think this way this isn't the right way

624
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,000
to think whatever it might be and arm
basically

625
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,078
it comes down to athletics and a lot of
people think of it in a hacker community

626
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,390
that we don't have assets we do in fact
if we didn't the people on the inside of

627
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,359
your company power you have in their
mouth everybody and everybody would know

628
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,529
all your secrets

629
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,849
that's not the way it works so this is a
little short video Roger boys really

630
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:07,880
talking and I think it carries a lot
more room wait to listen to him then

631
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,049
they had me actually talk about it but
i'll let you listen to this

632
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:21,049
before I start I want purpose

633
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:25,970
the remark i'm going to show you the
NASA state video launched that was like

634
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,879
to all the contractors on the program

635
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,819
I have to tell you is the first time I
actually sorrow on my facility i didn't

636
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:44,960
even know it was available till I was
about doing business program and this is

637
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,089
the only one I actually saw my plan
before I sure what do I want to press

638
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,770
upon several things

639
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:57,259
although this may sound like a craft
state it's not meant to be but the

640
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,569
challenges story and use this case study
to help students understand what's going

641
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:07,670
to be coming up especially it's not
about the death seven national and I

642
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,869
know that sounds horrible

643
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:11,869
it's not about that was a horrible
horrible

644
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:17,780
combination on the event itself seven
exceptional people for their eyes such

645
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,300
irresponsible losses

646
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:25,040
it's also not about the loss over 2
billion dollars which part

647
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,810
what it's about this professionals in
the system

648
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:35,540
who had the authority and responsibility
and fiduciary interest to do the right

649
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,190
thing and they advocated that they
advocated that because they'll

650
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,440
oppression to do so by the agency called
NASA as you will hear it

651
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:53,750
three holes so advocating your control
that it gets kinda concerned and I guess

652
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,530
in a way when he says it like that right
now I'm not saying that people in the

653
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,620
corporate culture actually advocated
that control but i'm sure that can

654
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,609
happen

655
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:07,670
okay and I'm sure it does happen arm but
what happens when it's not just one

656
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,480
vehicle

657
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,960
we're talking about connecting multiple
vehicles two different types of systems

658
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,990
now we're talking about cloud computing
we're talking about expanded further

659
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,620
it's going to be more than just one
system eventually overall i know this

660
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,460
from a matter of fact because two years
ago I attended the U of M cybersecurity

661
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,180
summit and I heard one of the
professor's up there talking about how

662
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,419
they're trying to work on photography
that the actually go ahead and work in a

663
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,250
public key infrastructure to secure
vehicles so that people can't go ahead

664
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,970
and start to do man in the middle
effects on different types of vehicles

665
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,240
and that's great because they're working
on defenses right now before it even

666
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,810
occurs so there's a lot of there's a lot
of due diligence going on in the system

667
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:55,759
and you know hopefully do care will
follow and basically I think we owe it

668
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,980
all to ourselves from that standpoint
you know that we can actually go ahead

669
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,870
and build better systems

670
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,560
now I want to actually just take the
time here to actually talk about some of

671
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,930
the hackers of the past present and
future

672
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,529
these guys are all hackers whether
you're Henry Ford whether your dodge

673
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,020
brothers or Tesla arm

674
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,030
who is just wave recently ahead of his
time we have we have

675
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:24,580
you know Chris and charlie we have craig
smith you know and the list goes on and

676
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,750
on and on

677
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:32,140
the only difference between them and us
that I see is that there's time

678
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:37,029
the fourth dimension you know it just
goes on and on but they started over a

679
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,670
hundred years ago they had different
systems to work on and we have different

680
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,640
systems now there's integration and
there's a lot of things that we can do

681
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,920
together we collaborate so and if we do
it great that they do it through a good

682
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,270
job about it

683
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:57,100
so what are our actions basically what
will be the next actions that we take as

684
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,930
individuals as hackers in the community
are we gonna go out there are we gonna

685
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,980
shut down more cars

686
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,690
I gotta get i don't i don't want to even
think about like Chris and and Charlie

687
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,040
have you put in that position

688
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,259
I don't want to think about anybody
being put in that position that we

689
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,260
actually would feel like that like we
have to do that

690
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,360
I don't I would never do that myself
personally but I would be really really

691
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,380
impressed in a way if i disclose
something and it was never fixed

692
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:28,629
knowing that somebody could actually
find that and not fix it so I you know

693
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,690
again it comes with a collaboration it
comes with that trust and if we have

694
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,220
that trust together we can build better
relationships and it sounds really basic

695
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,899
and really simple and it's not really a
solution for all but again it goes back

696
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,130
to those concepts to listen without
prejudice and you know some of the other

697
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,440
things that we talked about it's all
made up

698
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,070
you got to realize that we we do have
positive futures together

699
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:54,190
the good thing is if you are in a car
hacking a vehicle hacking or anything

700
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:54,910
like that

701
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,750
the major automotive companies are after
those types of people they're starving

702
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:03,280
form right now they want to fix things
and you can you don't believe it

703
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,120
go out to the four GM or any of those
guys I'm doing right now I'm actually

704
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,670
looking at at the web right now and I'm
seeing and GM alone and CNR MCN a

705
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,990
different types of postings for a
vehicle hack and stuff like that because

706
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,100
they're concerned they want to do due
diligence they want to do you do things

707
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,870
to do character process

708
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,770
and that is a good positive thing I see
a great bright future

709
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:30,820
I don't see a a dark one I see one that
we can work together

710
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,880
I see a lot of positive things coming
out of this and I think if we all look

711
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,690
at it and we approach it that way that
and the automotive manufacturers i'm

712
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,890
sure it would say the same thing and I
think we we can all do things that are

713
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,450
amazing and fix things and make sure
that big pile ups don't happen you know

714
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,919
with different vehicles and stuff like
that so that's the end

715
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,150
i'm dr. zero Dave shaper I have some
real paradigm blog i probably have an

716
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,800
updated for a while put i used to write
a lot of logs I do a lot of tweets and

717
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,950
stuff like that so if you want to follow
me that's my information but that's

718
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,950
