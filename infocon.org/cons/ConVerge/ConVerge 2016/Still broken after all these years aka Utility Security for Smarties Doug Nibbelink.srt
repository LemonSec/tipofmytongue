1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:18,640
yeah

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,119
yeah

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,640
okay all right

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,790
nope

5
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,700
well thanks for sticking around I the
only one standing between you and

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,990
probably free booze

7
00:00:48,990 --> 00:01:01,650
so very kind of you my standard
disclaimer and so I work for a

8
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,060
city-owned utility i was at the
presentation by the gentleman from

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:14,700
consumers earlier and so similar similar
work but being for profit versus

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,259
city-owned obviously we also want to
stay in a black but yeah a little a

11
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,399
little bit different on

12
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:29,550
he did a great job that was really glad
to see that not all of his content

13
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,990
overlap mine but first going to talk
about a physical threat

14
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,500
squirrels oddly enough squirrels cause a
lot of power outages

15
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,760
there's also some other causes i just
got a email from work

16
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,770
we had a major three circuit outage this
morning caused by bird across i managed

17
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,548
to touch to the lines on a big
transformer blew it

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,539
so it's it's crazy there's also there's
someone media articles you'll see

19
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,850
I love this headline

20
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,329
this is what's called a hand hole
basically this is where fiber optic

21
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,360
cables are tied together

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,230
splice junction there was a incident we
had where a chipmunk found its way into

23
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,890
this box with lid on i'm not sure how to
manage that may be a vast array of

24
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,149
tunnels but multiple fiber outages

25
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,950
so one time one of our fiber guys went
out there and he found the squirrel in

26
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,018
there and i kind of made me think if
they're using nutella like flavor

27
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:52,239
the insulation why would chew I think
you could make a lot of money if you

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,540
figure out how to make insulation that
tastes terrible

29
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,750
- animals so it if you're an inventor
the my coworker headed to dispatch the

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,750
chipmunk sadly with a shovel

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,950
but so I i found some pictures

32
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,530
we've got I want to warn you in case
you're sensitive to seeing that animals

33
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:23,350
on that used to be a squirrel and the
one of the if you see those green metal

34
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,079
boxes out there like electrical boxes
that this was in a patented transformer

35
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:35,019
we got a concrete pad big refrigerator
looking box cause a lot of outages that

36
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,180
it didn't end well for this world and
it's weird to see it without hair on the

37
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,780
tail

38
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,230
you're like man let's look rat like me
but website i really like cyber school

39
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,869
1.com they they track is as much as is
made public

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,660
how did it is caused by animals and so
even have some options here for drop

41
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,340
down so this was the last six months
worth of the squirrel cause power

42
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,950
outages and there's 743 birds

43
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,899
321 raccoons and underneath that you can
see over there were snakes like 50 of

44
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,339
them because those can also get in those
patented transformers and cross two

45
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:28,929
wires and food so and this is a map of
known reported cyberattacks causing loss

46
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,800
of power

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,280
also in the last six months one ok

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,559
as far as known so so it's a little bit
different but I i love in post sack i

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,699
like security

50
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,790
I don't hate animals but they they cause
problems

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:52,360
oh yeah its side with I thought I could
make up some clothes of famous people to

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,960
see

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,169
so what are what are some natural
solutions to the scroll problem

54
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,810
birds of prey perhaps maybe Bob Katter
III telephone poles or so

55
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,909
clicker literacy training

56
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:13,990
ok this this one came to me one night
and I'm like maybe it could work

57
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,489
because if you could teach them to read
those warning stickers maybe they would

58
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,560
they would not go there

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,919
plus i love that picture so i had to use
it

60
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,758
alright so i want to cover some basics
on electricity as my disclaimer so I'm

61
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,930
not an engineer

62
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,389
so forgive me if you are new year no
more about this an idea but it just is

63
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,120
helpful to have some background while
setting voltage electrical pressure

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,800
measured in volts current your amperes
or amps the movement of the charge power

65
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,460
the rate at which the electricity does
work

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,330
that's usually kilowatts like your meter
on your on your home

67
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,679
it's going to be a lot of energy the
amount of work that can be done by the

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,180
electricity and that's that's usually
kilowatt hours for your career home

69
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,770
meter

70
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:17,049
how much does it make a lot of this is a
widely used example just 10,000 hundred

71
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:24,010
watt light bulbs would take up one
megawatt load of power also about 800

72
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,700
average home

73
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:33,159
or 250 summer in Phoenix everybody's got
their air on chris from consumers that

74
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,770
the two o'clock prezzo through this out
but basically you got four main

75
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,770
components for for the electrical grid
in the u.s. you have generation on

76
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,539
making power you have transmission which
is moving it from point a to point be

77
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,990
like from the power plant to your house

78
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,450
distribution this is where it gets a
little weird but distribution is the

79
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,710
last mile

80
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,620
so to speak so here you go here's your
house or business but what will happen

81
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,530
is the generators or the power plants
come out our comes out goes to a step up

82
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,719
transformer because electricity is more
efficiently move over long distances

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,200
when it's a higher voltage so they bump
that up

84
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,409
usually on average it's going to be
above a hundred kilovolts then like you

85
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:33,130
see the really neither cool looking but
the the huge metal holes like Alan

86
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,480
country or between cities are
occasionally you'll have a transmission

87
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,640
customer here with a higher voltage then
on step down

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,860
bring them back down as you moved it as
close as you can that last mile and then

89
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,310
it's going to come down to what we know
it on your house hundred twenty volts

90
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:59,800
240 volts or commercial customers
usually have on three phase power but I

91
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,700
don't want to go to the two phase 3
phase thing because I I won't explain it

92
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,330
ready

93
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:11,710
so power grid in the US and canada is
divided up into three sections you've

94
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:19,270
got now the west to the east and texas
which I find kind of . it Texas is huge

95
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,200
right but I kind of thought maybe it was
just in case you want to leave the u.s.

96
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,770
you know this is ced or something they
they got their own thing I don't know

97
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,599
they see a balancing read regional

98
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,700
balancing authorities this is kind of an
eye chart i also like there's no bubbles

99
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,900
thighs determined by acronym with it's
like okay so these aren't this is on a

100
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,990
scale here but we're in Michigan

101
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,210
we're in pink section and the user
though the regions that are managed

102
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,810
based on how much power generation
rights

103
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:01,890
so basically making sure that each of
these sections which are interconnected

104
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,500
on across the country

105
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,390
each of these sections has enough
generation to meet the demand and alone

106
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:15,300
and then next you have

107
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,939
okay so I talked about the four
components generation transmission and

108
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,550
distribution on the transmission the the
moving of the power that's actually

109
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,609
managed and handled by usually separate
organizations

110
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,630
so these are the different regions i
don't i don't know what happened here

111
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:39,120
it's like no man's land but but we're in
the mid continent or the Midwest iso

112
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,550
Independent System Operator region

113
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,609
so all of Michigan and connected down to
most of Indiana Illinois etc

114
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,089
that's the region wherein the
transmission and and the organization is

115
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,540
responsible for that their job is to say
we can make sure we can move power more

116
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,819
than one way to any region

117
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,900
so you might have to kind of like having
a dual internet pipe two different

118
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,280
providers coming in so that your you
know if your loss of power is going to

119
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,870
be temporary or gets cut over like gum
where I work we have we have our

120
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,870
distribution ring for the city

121
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,530
it's two paths so you have to

122
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,730
two rings that HP use if there's a
compromise in one of the others

123
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,980
so you have the transmission and the
distribution regions are different

124
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,080
see so do we have compliance in the
electric sector

125
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:45,260
yes so I look compliance because it
leads to jobs for people like me but

126
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,210
then again you know I'm not going to
talk about how compliant doesn't mean

127
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,740
secure and secure doesn't mean compliant
but it's it's well-intentioned but how

128
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,370
the nerd National Electric Regulatory
Commission and perk which is the federal

129
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:09,440
after the 2003 rolling blackout if you
on recall or heard about that it was bad

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,370
ok it was a failure on multiple levels I
love this image of satellite view here

131
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,959
as it so happens some population density
centers like New Yorker in there but

132
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,410
then i lo and behold I find out this
image isn't real

133
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,500
there is no I sad geostar 45 satellite
but and that the real images are much

134
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,820
less cool so I wanted to use this one
but it warned you that it's not legit

135
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,620
okay real quick history of automation
how did we get to where we are today

136
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,540
big generator I think early nineteen
hundreds or so you got the well-dressed

137
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,089
man pushing the button turning it on

138
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,450
there's no valves no pages obviously no
computer

139
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,930
okay fast-forward diesel generator bunch
of dials gauges you got rpm voltage etc

140
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,640
local control the generator is right
behind it then

141
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,100
this is still analog days okay so all of
these remote systems could be brought

142
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,350
into a single control room

143
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,950
i love how they got the desk sitting
right in the middle like how cool is

144
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,610
that

145
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,170
and nowadays it's going to look more
like this and i don't know about you but

146
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,610
i think i'd rather work in this room
then be matching shirt guy you know

147
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,140
they're there

148
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:32,920
this little table but that's just me but
it is cooling up a wall of monitors you

149
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,370
know it's kind of like a some of the
security operations center images you

150
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,260
see you're like wow

151
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,750
ok so for the rest of my talk I'm gonna
cover the components in an industrial

152
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,920
control system

153
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,620
i'm going to talk about some of the
challenges to security of data and

154
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,470
define skata some of the methods to
mitigate these threats and Ukraine

155
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,840
incident which I'm totally obsessed with
I apologize but so when I first started

156
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,180
about 10 years working for the utility

157
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,930
this is kind of what i thought about
when you say control system or ICS and

158
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:14,560
like and and I don't read any of the
language like this

159
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,930
besides English but um so it was all
Greek to me or japanese chinese in this

160
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,079
case but just know this is actually a
diagram of a system to deliver oxygen to

161
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,250
your farm

162
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:33,280
I'm like wow that's crazy so with ideas
acronyms

163
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,850
so does the utility world

164
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,350
ot you'll hear thrown around they're
talking about the difference between

165
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,350
like whether it's a utility power plant
etc or manufacturing you have operations

166
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,220
technology

167
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,240
those are the people you know in the
plants are on on the floor at the at the

168
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,280
manufacturing site

169
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,370
okey so that's that ICS

170
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,040
oh yeah I Louisville tea I saw this was
walking around on a college campus after

171
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,250
an event I was like man I want to use
that and then you read the fine print

172
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,450
sexually occupational therapy but you
know acronym collisions i think they

173
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,230
call those

174
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,410
skata i was at a event utility event one
time and I heard the guy pronounced at

175
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,280
scanner so i don't know if that's like
the gym gift thing but for what it's

176
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,150
worth

177
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,130
ICS industrial control system and this
this could be anything that has

178
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,550
complexity beyond you know a small space

179
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:40,479
i mean it's it's in manufacturing it's
an automotive etc food production

180
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,830
I nearly nearly everything you could
imagine that that has to involve

181
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,240
machinery

182
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,110
it's it's probably got an ICS acronym
collision number two at ICS is also the

183
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,970
International chili society

184
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,150
ok so just real quick some of the
components of a control system or ICS

185
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:07,510
our sensors this one of the better
images i could find even though I was

186
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,810
kind of lame but these are just some
different things like these

187
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,579
this might be a temperature sensor gap
pressure all the things you can measure

188
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:22,900
or or status or state if you will could
be on off then of course those sensors

189
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,910
wherever they're deployed those have to
talk back to some other equipment i'll

190
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,640
talk about next but like any other
computer networking scenario you've got

191
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,689
all the usual suspects of ways you can
make people make things talk to each

192
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:44,500
other so you'll see is another acronym
almost any industrial control system is

193
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,170
going to have a PLC really these are
just little computers

194
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:53,349
it's got a cpu it's got some memory on
some like flash memory or or

195
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,210
non-volatile what these do these are
usually program with a laptop

196
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,310
the the vendors will give you some
software that lets you write the code to

197
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,420
tell this

198
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,240
I call it a brain what to do and it does
it super reliable this happens to be a

199
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,890
seaman's on theirs

200
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,040
allen-bradley Snyder SEL there's a whole
bunch of massive vendors in the space

201
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,530
but basically what you have is your you
might have a ethernet and activity but

202
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,970
then over here and and

203
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,519
there's many varieties appeals he's but
hearing each each one of these has a

204
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,970
whole bunch of connection points for
those sensor that i showed you before so

205
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:44,569
you have usually to lead wires coming in
telling the PLC their status and then

206
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:50,899
for the computer visualization of the
control system you have what's called

207
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:56,000
HMI human-machine interface which is
which is basically the picture

208
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
representing what's going on

209
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,160
so real quick i wanted to

210
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,179
let's go over a simple example they got
it you got a tank of water

211
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,850
you have an output you have a pump input
then you have something that is going to

212
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,458
measure the sensor is going to measure
the depth of the controller which is

213
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:23,299
possible to enable or turn on or off the
palm to add more water or most likely

214
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:26,900
they're also going to have control on
the output but then when you're sitting

215
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,380
there at your operator's station looking
at what

216
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,669
what's happening in real time this is
what you would see on the computer

217
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,740
screen so that tank

218
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,490
I showed you even though wasn't a photo
but this is what the operator would see

219
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,340
and and then on the PLC code

220
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,020
you're going to have set points that if
it's an autumn automatic system versus

221
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,590
one where the the operator has to
control things that set . could be

222
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,480
whenever you get below twenty five
percent start the pump when it reaches

223
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,309
ninety to a hundred percent turn off the
ball so that that's that's a real simple

224
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:09,620
example when because the utility I work
for we also do clean water water

225
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,469
treatment and wastewater treatment

226
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,429
we have what are called pump stations
around it when you're driving around

227
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,830
sometimes you'll see a brick kind of a
nondescript building one story square

228
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,649
maybe 12 feet by 12 feet inside of a
clean water pump station

229
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:34,610
there's pulse crazy I know but then also
what you're going to see is usually a

230
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,330
cabinet on the wall inside there with
the plc and at the brain

231
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,428
and then you've got some power
transformers a lot of the deployed

232
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,380
equipment uses DC current and then a
patch panel of some sort because all

233
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,120
those sensors for each pump and each
tank underneath the palm is going to

234
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,590
have sensors that come back and are read
by the PLC usually than that pump

235
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,360
station connects back to the control
center is what they normally call it

236
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,709
like the three guys sit at the table in
front of all the screens so you've got a

237
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,860
PLC like device in your home's anyone
have a guess

238
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,269
well there's there's actually more than
one but what you got it

239
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:26,240
thermostat so controlling your furnace
and or your AC basically you're an

240
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,929
operator

241
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:31,340
you set this thing you say if it gets
below this town fire up the furnace

242
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,439
if if it gets hotter than a certain
point turn on the air and then when it

243
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,080
reaches the threshold or the set point
for cooling like it gets back down to 70

244
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,668
then kick off the air

245
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,970
so that's that's a whole simple example
on

246
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,950
here's an image of a clean water process
you've got a pump station coming into

247
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,990
holding tanks then there's clarifiers
and then they show you kind of

248
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,200
everything that's involved all the way
back to the control center

249
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,389
so that's I thought that was kind of a
cool thing on here is an example of an

250
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:09,229
HMI for that diagram that I just showed
you and what it would look like for the

251
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,130
operator

252
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,500
the interesting thing is I blocked out
which wich where this is because it was

253
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,899
on a vendor and integrator website

254
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,489
they're like look at all this great work
we did in this area and then there you

255
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:22,970
go

256
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,130
I mean so from a from a not set
perspective that's not not really so

257
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,480
much what you want

258
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,590
I understand vendors want to have
recommendations or you know customer

259
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:39,740
testimonials but I I wouldn't want our
stuff out here like that

260
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:44,960
now this is this is one of my favorite
example hmm is this is actually the

261
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,860
brewery is on a brewery tour I think it
was

262
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,049
what was that it was great lakes brewing
and in Cleveland and and there's the guy

263
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,860
the operator sitting at a desk with us
and I'm like I take a picture of that

264
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,820
he's like yeah I shared with the guys at
the plane is here like that's cool i

265
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,220
want that jet on you got the the holding
tanks and everything and I just thought

266
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,170
that was cool so what are some of the
challenges to control system ICS or

267
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,880
skate of security

268
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,470
well these systems are really important
and as you can imagine like Chris was

269
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,630
talking about earlier today

270
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,360
you want your power to work you flip on
the switch you want it want the light to

271
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,309
go on if you turn on your faucet you
want clean water to come out it

272
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:35,530
you know not nothing and not Flint water
for example but on also when you flush

273
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,690
your toilet and the things that you have
purged from your body you want that

274
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,549
stuff to go away right

275
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:47,799
ok you don't want to just sit there so
so the these systems we rely on every

276
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,910
day are pretty important on some kind of
bias but yeah

277
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,549
and the other thing is without power you
generally can't do water filtration or

278
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:04,418
wastewater treatment right so it all
comes back to that arm and operations

279
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:08,530
technology or OT they they want that
stuff on all the time

280
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,910
I mean that they've been doing the 59
stuff for like 50 years right

281
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,570
I t which which is you know my world
obviously a little different you know in

282
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,129
infosec to talk about the CIA triad some
of the jokes are the OT there there's no

283
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:24,940
triangle

284
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,860
it's just availability right and
secondarily integrity yes that's

285
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,820
important

286
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,970
confidentiality it's it's getting there
this because I love screen beans

287
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,040
you know I just had to use this again
but little characters in office but so

288
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,299
you know the two worlds the acronyms
like really hot

289
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:51,910
separation of the OT world versus IT on

290
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,960
that's changing fortunately and that's
that's leading to improve security and

291
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,390
and basically me getting along

292
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,140
with the guys at the plants and knowing
that I'm just not going to happen patch

293
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,840
their server on patch tuesday and then
suddenly the lights go dim not good

294
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,680
some shared knowledge and understanding

295
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,240
events like this can help a lot with
that just spreading the word and then

296
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,740
understanding what you're protecting and
securing talking to the operators

297
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,550
I love doing that I bring them doughnuts
that goes even better challenges again

298
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,870
24-7 security is seen as a separate
objective

299
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,070
you know they just want their stuff to
work right because the plan don't hate

300
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,580
me

301
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,210
most of the time but you know sometimes
I t we break stop right

302
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,470
I love this this is one of the first
PLC's ever made and that's the team that

303
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,960
created it before the PLC you were
talking all electric relays electronic

304
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,640
switches so one box like this and you
know and now you can fit in your pocket

305
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,110
basically he used to be a huge cabinet
full of all these relays you know

306
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,040
click clack click clack and not easy to
reconfigure right now you can do it all

307
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,170
through software pretty amazing

308
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:13,000
oh yeah and someone I can't remember who
said it that someone was talking about

309
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,410
the amount of time that we use this
stuff right we are our power plant has

310
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,660
some generators that are four years old

311
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,350
what what operating system do you think
was around then

312
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,370
right besides like the guy in mainframe
stuff i mean you're talking

313
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,190
not a lot of computerization and then .
the whole idea 0 days

314
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,780
now we have decade days right this
display laws then around as long as this

315
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,889
this crusty old box of vintage
technology you're going to see this

316
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,540
stuff deployed now 2016

317
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,170
when was the last time you any of you
touch a spark station

318
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,320
crickets that's what I thought

319
00:24:53,830 --> 00:25:00,490
um then the other thing that that's kind
of crazy so I less than 10 years ago

320
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,590
that only been in my job or at the
utility 10 years I watched a guy load

321
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,290
solaris to something from floppies after
a hard drive failure and I'm like

322
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:16,840
what happened did I get into a time
portal of some kind or art and and then

323
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,250
this is really cool

324
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,390
one of the more popular power plant
control systems is from westinghouse

325
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,250
this is their West station

326
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,580
they made it just like a spark box you
can stack them

327
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,580
it's awesome literally a month ago I
come back from a meeting and this is on

328
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,699
my chair with a post-it note that says i
need another one

329
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,210
and I'm like what

330
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:46,210
and and and so this is a 9600 baud modem
and and I mean it maybe it's not a total

331
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,950
surprise but 90 world right you're like
no this this didn't really happen yeah

332
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:57,070
it did on there are some locations for a
pump station or lift station is is what

333
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,000
is you

334
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,270
what what is called the little square
building to move the sewage so I i

335
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:09,580
always was getting that infuse my first
started working at the utility until one

336
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,830
of the the call center people said dog
you pump the water you gotta lift the

337
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,179
poop ever since then it's just been
really easy to remember on

338
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,110
so okay so i was able to

339
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,139
fortunately find an upgrade

340
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:32,380
so and you can actually buy the zoom
9600 so I mean some you

341
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,060
these these are in a location where you
can get fiber there at a cost effective

342
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:44,409
on price and and it wasn't really a good
location for something like sometimes

343
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,800
you'll see cellular modems deployed or
maybe cable connection or dsl but this

344
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,360
spot had none of these so they had this
crappy old pots line and like if you if

345
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,699
you try to pick up the phone was in that
room

346
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,750
it was all crackles because it went God
knows where like under sand dune here

347
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,630
there and everywhere but but it works

348
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:11,560
so this is a vintage picture of one of
the Westinghouse systems and it you

349
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,010
might still this was taken a while back
but here's the operator sitting at his

350
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,900
desk watching the Diff'rent HMI

351
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,850
this and the stuff works and and it's
kind of impressive to me

352
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,969
the life span you have ICS had had IOT
boar was cool i like to call the

353
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:34,450
internet of old things I don't know how
to say that like I you some more of the

354
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,060
security challenges are some distinction
has been made a design flaw vs of

355
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,639
vulnerability some of the early PLC's
didn't have passwords . to make changes

356
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,760
okay so there was progress made from
that standpoint moving up into say 10-15

357
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,500
years ago but then what would happen is
the design engineers not having a

358
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,860
background in an inn in full sack or
like wall

359
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,969
let's make the password 1234 home by the
way you can change it

360
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,000
you cannot and and some of the devices
when you would try and change the

361
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,840
password on the PLC to make programming
changes that they would they would

362
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,550
actually fail

363
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,580
not cool okay well that's that's pretty
different now

364
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,879
so that's that's a good thing
authentication and logging

365
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,700
I feel like I see a security has matured
a lot if you think back to business IT

366
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,750
and infosec that's been a long path to
maturity to where we are now

367
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,970
I guess you could argue about the
maturity part but regardless I feel like

368
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:42,280
a lot of progress has been made so I
don't wanna don't paint a bleak picture

369
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,970
Plus as chris from consumers was saying
earlier the electrical grid is is

370
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,350
complex

371
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,330
so it's very difficult for all to fail
at once and and that that actually made

372
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,980
me pretty happy

373
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,010
open it ok change management now for plc
code they have some change control our

374
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,040
version control check in and check out
so that's cool

375
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,360
there are firmware updates a lot of
modern plc is actually a web servers we

376
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,439
don't really know what

377
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,720
what code they're running or what
version of whatever embedded OS so now

378
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,790
there's there's a lot more attention to
for more updates which is good because

379
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,580
then you can secure those obviously you
want to segment them and separate them

380
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,750
but also some of the peels he's actually
literally have a key on you turn it to

381
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,310
run only mode you can make her
programmatic changes until you actually

382
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,220
physically have someone turn it to
rewrite

383
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,580
so that's that's a very simple thing but
he'll whole OS patching a better support

384
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,179
for that's increasing a lot of the
vendors will will tell you exactly which

385
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,660
patches not to apply if you were where
possible on and and honestly most of it

386
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,590
is is mature enough that that you can
you can patch you just want to be

387
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,010
careful and and test or wait for the
vendor to say it's okay

388
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,900
a week later after patch tuesday they're
like yeah you're good on the activity

389
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:12,020
versus talked earlier mentioned this air
gaps are becoming extinct one of the one

390
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,520
of the places you use still will likely
have their gaps as nuclear because the

391
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,680
NRC the nuclear rocket Regulatory
Commission is they thought that through

392
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,600
a long time ago because you don't want

393
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:31,310
as you know an attacker hacker causing a
nuclear meltdown arm but and sometimes I

394
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,629
think -

395
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,670
as I approach retirement I think man I
want to work at a new plant right

396
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,360
because you got the air gap but still
things like USB keys

397
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,840
those can move sneakernet now of course
the business users want to know

398
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,320
management wants to know what the
powerpoints doing in any given time

399
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,870
also the movement from from a flat
network to AC else and vlans which is

400
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:02,479
progress and then now two more specific
part of all implementations and there's

401
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,750
there's growing use of network security
monitoring

402
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:11,930
I love this picture i do not know what
it is but the one of the one of the guys

403
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,790
made a presentation about unicorns and
perhaps and and I wanted to use that so

404
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,780
on

405
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,990
just some some other quotes i found
helpful and inspiring

406
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:29,460
so and and network segmentation is huge

407
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,820
so it's basically applying infosec
knowledge to what you've been doing on

408
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,210
the business side to the utility side
and no wing

409
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,880
what is happening who has VPN on their
solutions that will provide a one-way

410
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,130
network path like a data diode waterfall
i think is the vendor who is doing that

411
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,180
so that's pretty cool because then you
know you're only getting a read of data

412
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,290
no one's you know going to be and
mapping your plc because some of those

413
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,260
will just fail if if you if you scan on

414
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,040
but again that's also improving with
newer products

415
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,380
there's end-to-end encryption you can
put in some of the oddball protocols

416
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,720
that that are in the ICS basic mod
busters en e and usually those are now

417
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,300
in capsulated with in tcp/ip the mp3 is
actually quite secure

418
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,149
that's the latest version wireshark and
and interpret my boss and EMP packet

419
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,530
captures and and a sound like i
mentioned before on some of the other

420
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:37,470
things you know this has long documents
that that kind of help paint a picture

421
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,090
of what you should be doing

422
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:45,090
there's also growth in specialty
consulting firms on i'm a huge sands fan

423
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:51,090
they've got two and they're working on
more ICS security classes and there's a

424
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:57,360
certification on so they have ICS pork
and i was fortunate to get approval to

425
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,760
go to that and then the cert because i
have certifications as you're probably

426
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,750
aware but there

427
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,630
there's ICS security cert so I got that
and that's pretty that's kind of

428
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,840
interesting i think there's going to be
a lot of growth in the ICS security

429
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,580
space so if you're interested in this
stuff that their jobs and and it's it's

430
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,220
a great field in my opinion

431
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,220
oh yeah standards

432
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:30,210
nervous if I talked about the also
Department of Homeland Security the cssp

433
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:36,090
group they do they do great stuff
control system security program this is

434
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,110
their mission but the thing is they do
training this free

435
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,310
they have a five day it's it's I can't
say it's as good as sands but they have

436
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:49,500
a five-day training that if you're in an
industry sector that this would apply to

437
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:55,470
you you have to get yourself there but
it it was really well done there's the

438
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,220
last day there is a Red Team Blue team
exercise of like real equipment got a

439
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,770
big water tank heal season and people
are breaking stuff left and right it was

440
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:10,199
it was really eye-opening kinda scared
me thinking about my employer but

441
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,399
ics-cert is the industrial control
systems certain they'll track

442
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,250
vulnerabilities and products and idaho
national labs in partnership with DHS

443
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,840
does vendor testing

444
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,370
so the big vendors will send them their
gear and I'll break it until now to fix

445
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,060
it it's it's so the disclosure is
happening and that's cool

446
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,560
I've only vulnerability assessments
penetration testing will even send

447
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,649
people out and the thing with the DHS
ICS are cssp group they don't

448
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:44,668
communicate with people like nerd ok so
if they come out and help you do an

449
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:48,929
assessment and how to improve security
they will take nothing with them they

450
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,409
don't document things are just there to
give advice is really cool

451
00:34:53,070 --> 00:35:00,150
some of the threats that you may have
heard of Stuxnet that was like I would

452
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,050
dream about Stuxnet and all that sounds
kind of strange but I was so obsessed on

453
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,460
a roll my master's thesis on Stuxnet and
that's how much of a nerd i am but

454
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,840
there's many other shamoun black energy
that are more utility specific

455
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,930
there's a number of skata incidents
involving attackers are hackers doing

456
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:24,419
things are not that many you get
publicized out for some obvious reasons

457
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:31,020
but the big one was Stuxnet but this
past December if if you had heard of on

458
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,069
the incident in the Ukraine the power
outage i'm going to talk about that

459
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:40,799
yeah that's just a great glamour shot of
one of my heroes role playing or he he

460
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:45,390
unpacked the Stuxnet code reverse
engineered it and he did a talk there's

461
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,430
a conference every January called s4
just for ICS security and I got to shake

462
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,578
his hand last year i felt like i was
meeting Justin Bieber

463
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:57,719
I was like twelve this like I'm never
going to wash this hand again but i did

464
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,079
just want you to know that um so they

465
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,380
yeah I don't want to talk too much about
stuck snap because i want to get done on

466
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,829
time but I want to talk a little bit
about Ukraine is it

467
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:12,749
it was it was published right around the
time the power outages were happening

468
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:19,979
and then I think for the good of the of
the global community of ICS and security

469
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:24,989
they shared a lot of information which
you know as you know it breaches when it

470
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:25,890
hits the news

471
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:31,979
that's kind of a you know a negative
thing for your corporate image your

472
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:37,890
brand but I think wisely they shared a
lot they actually worked with like sands

473
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:43,259
DHS other agencies to share information
so they could unpack this

474
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:47,069
so on newark sent out this alert and and
i love this

475
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,808
this is like government speak mitigating
ever cereal manipulation of industrial

476
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,900
control systems as evidenced by recent
international events

477
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,130
ok now now the the translated version
which is actually a much better report

478
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,630
analysis of the cyber attack on the
Ukrainian power grid thank you

479
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:10,979
it's it's like reading a lawyer lawyer
ease but ok so in five or six minutes I

480
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:17,788
want to go over how amazingly well
planned and orchestrated the Ukraine

481
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:22,380
attack was ok so then like like most
targeted attacks this is not

482
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,299
opportunistic they did a bunch of
research

483
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:27,420
well they found out which three

484
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,739
these these are three different
companies in the Ukraine and they their

485
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,809
role was just distribution

486
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:37,410
ok so they get the power to your house
three locations three companies

487
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,090
the Russian word which I don't know what
to say blowing air goes but obviously

488
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:50,610
the word of energies in there so they
discovered what kind of some of the

489
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,990
automation software and ICS hardware and
software that that was out there and

490
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:00,899
then sigh social engineering it
eventually it's going to work so they

491
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,410
they had targeted spear phishing emails
that contain a macro

492
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,799
so this is where like at work I'm always
like you see that button

493
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,960
don't ever touch that button you did you
know especially email files but anyway

494
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,920
on

495
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,750
so human factor obviously social in
hearing it

496
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,640
it usually works but we do I i am a
believer and user wearing spring we do

497
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,990
that work on a recurring basis but then
you need prevention and detection

498
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,359
ok so once one or more people on the
business network received that email

499
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,650
because it actually came from a
generating company or with spoon - so

500
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,800
it's it's kind of a no-brainer you're
like no I'm going to delete that right

501
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,100
I want to get fired once they enable the
macros the malware was a very into black

502
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,980
energy three then command and control
out

503
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,360
hold down the malware they the game
persistence because of course if if they

504
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,350
closed one door they wanted to have
multiple external entry points from the

505
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:08,970
internet then they started to pivot on
kind of typical whole incident analysis

506
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,129
you know they're they're seeing what
they can get to their mapping the

507
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,150
network they were able to harvest
credentials they found there was a VPN

508
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:19,410
into the control system Network which it

509
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,770
it happens there you know the vendor
wants to get in

510
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,370
they analyzed the software that all
three of these companies had different

511
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:32,490
softly so i mean this this is not your
your three teenagers in the basement go

512
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,529
let's remove the Poland Ukraine

513
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,910
also you know not not that the dwell
time is estimated to have been six

514
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,740
months which it isn't that terrible
obviously you want that to be more like

515
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,890
15 minutes but

516
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,368
a lot of time and effort they also
believed they had a test lab you know

517
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:55,289
and maybe not the actual equipment like
the the breakers the arm the

518
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:59,519
Transformers etc but they had the
software and they were able to look at

519
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,848
what was happening how these companies
did what they did put in some remote

520
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,380
access trojan

521
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,519
and then there's another piece of our
called hill disc which is just kind of a

522
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,348
new get kind of a thing they use but
again it wasn't about the malware was

523
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:21,329
about how well planned this was so many
pieces to it on attributions always get

524
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:25,740
a lot of attention it's it's it's
fascinating it's you know kind of spy vs

525
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,149
spy angle but i'm not sure it matters
that much but it probably wasn't rushing

526
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,920
just like Stuxnet probably was the US
and Israel but you know you you can

527
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,720
learn from it no matter what

528
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:46,109
ok so the day they press the big red
button number 23 around 3:30 p.m. most

529
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:48,930
of this information just so you know
it's from that stands report which you

530
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:54,149
even find its public and there's a
really good teams that are on article in

531
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,309
New York Times big fan of her she wrote
up on stuff that block that's excellent

532
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:04,140
on but so around three thirty the guys
getting ready to leave for the day also

533
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,769
his mouth starts moving and it starts
opening breakers

534
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:13,319
ok that means power is going out and
he's like I mean I can imagine his

535
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,660
reaction is like what is going on

536
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:21,210
he also in his screen went dark you know
and he starts trying to get his password

537
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,170
in two to undo what they're doing well
they locked the account

538
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:32,579
game over so roughly 250,000 customers
without were without power for three to

539
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,849
six hours so the outage actually didn't
last that long and that's a good thing

540
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,220
it's again not to talk too much about
attribution because it's all speculation

541
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,990
anyway unless you catch the people
involved but it's believed it was really

542
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,250
just a like a

543
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,980
hey week we could own you and we're just
going to fill power just kind of like a

544
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,839
sending a message but it

545
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,900
it's a pretty serious message also in
the winter

546
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,780
if they had wrecked a whole bunch of
stuff you think well are you going to

547
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,560
eat your home like to help our so it
could have been much much worse

548
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:11,490
sucker punch on they found networkable
network accessible ups's and they

549
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:16,529
weren't locked down like the browser
interface so they scheduled in phase

550
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,430
like 30 minutes after they cut the power
ups is one off

551
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,150
so your computer's go off in your
control center

552
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:29,850
I mean as a a guy that used to work for
you to say as a total dick move

553
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:37,020
I mean but brilliant I mean you have to
admire the the planning ok then i mean

554
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:43,230
this this blows my mind too that you see
a lot of field devices sensors are

555
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,750
serial so you convert that ethernet
right

556
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,610
serial ethernet inverters are everywhere
in ICS so they figured out how to break

557
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:56,280
them so they overrode the firmware no
columns right so you can click that

558
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,370
button all day once you finally get your
computer back up but nothing is

559
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:04,319
happening so then you have to deploy
field crews to go and actually manual

560
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,000
override and close the breakers to get
power back on and i forgot to put this

561
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,610
in here but there were there were on

562
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:18,180
I think it was something like 35
different substations that they kill and

563
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:25,379
I mean it's it's epic terrifying but and
very very advanced oh yeah

564
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,250
fortunately manual operation is still
generally possible in most systems and

565
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,760
configurations which is good right as
you want to be able to go there

566
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:40,680
you know all ever turn it on but they
had to go to each of those sites and

567
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:48,540
this is the kicker one of the three
companies at least they arranged to have

568
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,140
bogus calls flooded the call center
phones

569
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,170
so when you call to say hey I'm out of
power

570
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,830
what are you going to do about that they
couldn't even get through because they

571
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,029
had all these calls coming in like can
you tell me how much my bill is or and

572
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,330
they they probably just paid a bunch of
people to make these calls

573
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,830
I mean I mean that

574
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:13,380
and finally the manual operation
continued months and months later they

575
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,520
still haven't replaced

576
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,970
like all the all the field devices
because you know you have all these

577
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,439
brick converters

578
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,230
fortunately they could still operating
manual mode and again I I i was really

579
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,970
glad that all that information could be
brought out i mean like anything it's a

580
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,600
double-edged sword because it can
inspire other attack groups but you know

581
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,490
this was no small thing

582
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:41,370
closer to home recently Lansing's
city-owned utility got it with

583
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,430
ransomware fortunately it stayed on
their business network but it brought

584
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,839
down their payment system online and it
also took down there outage management

585
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,000
on most most utilities like like we do
or lansing that you go to a website if

586
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,410
there's a power outage will show you an
estimated where and when and how long it

587
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:04,440
will take to get back on but that was
down and i headed a very interesting

588
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,030
discussion with my boss's boss the
general manager about how their their

589
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:13,230
general manager which is like your CEO
equivalent he had to go in the media he

590
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,460
was on television

591
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,390
also nice that you started seeing this
article shared or the information shared

592
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:24,990
internationally like UK the the register
that IP news site i'm like all I was

593
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,580
like thank you God this was not me this
time but that that's like a really

594
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:35,160
really bad thing and again it reinforces
network segmentation because the rents

595
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,509
more did not get to the control system
thankfully the future I think they're

596
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,640
going to be more incidents

597
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,540
I try to remain an optimist because I I
don't like he said all the time or

598
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,640
paranoid but I think the defense is
getting better and i think the the the

599
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,069
vendors get it and they're doing a lot
like big vendors like GE and siemens

600
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:04,260
they're really paying a lot of attention
security and creating good products that

601
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,760
that are secure out of the box but
there's a lot of work to be done but but

602
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,580
it's it's a cool field on

603
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,569
hey thanks so much for coming out
appreciate it if you have any questions

604
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,110
I'm going to stick around a little bit

605
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,830
and then probably go get a beer I think
hot pad at six I think it's appliance

606
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,400
phone

607
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,470
thank you so much i'll also be here
tomorrow
