00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,200
I know for a lot of people thats their
young in the i.t field

20
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,850
stuff that you may have heard him talk
about earlier i recently got my sis p of

21
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,240
the fun one to get highly recommend if
you're ever in this in here in the IP

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,089
field as most of you are and why you're
here

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,310
personally I'm an adrenaline junkie I
just ran my first iron man i love

24
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,360
anything that gets my heart racing

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:07,000
and yeah so the preface this even before
we get into the century mba breaches we

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,030
hear about breaches every single day
every single news feed is coming

27
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,980
there's a new bridge be a small
mom-and-pop credit card emails are user

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,540
account information

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:29,109
aa-anything breaches from skimmers in
our and devices or anything just to give

30
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,930
you an idea these are some of the
biggest ones we've hit late that we've

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,209
hit probably in the past five years

32
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:39,580
tricare which is the military health
care provider five million accounts

33
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,530
compromise simply from that one

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,290
Ashley Madison ask Madison was a one of
the more recent ones 33 million accounts

35
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:55,209
compromise from that one home people
ought to be 56 million target 70 million

36
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:02,049
jpmorgan chase 76 million everyone's
favorite playstation playstation network

37
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,660
77 million

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:13,450
I anthem which is blue cross blue shield
that half was about 80 million TJ maxx

39
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,320
when the most basic ones with just
simply skimming devices and getting into

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,940
those the button and getting into the
computer system was 94 million accounts

41
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,700
compromise help land payment systems
this is the companies that basically

42
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,720
give the devices to retailers a swipe
the card whatever when that was

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,109
compromised that let out a hundred and
thirty million compromised accounts and

44
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,000
ebay everyone's favorite the biggest
hitting in the last couple years with

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,780
140 145 million accounts compromise

46
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,470
just on that screen right there just
think about the number of accounts how

47
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,170
many of you use or have swiped a credit
card I at Target or TJ maxx or have a

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,429
playstation network or utilize blue
cross blue shield or anything on there

49
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,670
how many people does that affect right
there i'd see

50
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,299
a good amount and if you've been if
you've been a victim of one of these you

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,099
know it's not just ok I gotta get a new
card its it can take time to get your

52
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,889
identity back and get time to identify
where things have been used in your name

53
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:28,000
or your credit card number has been used
some stats about breaches this is all

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,990
the fun number stop before we start
getting into the actual fun tool and it

55
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,120
will all blend together so

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,290
thirty-eight percent of global
organizations claim that they are

57
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,520
prepared for sophisticated cyber attack
only thirty-eight percent of companies

58
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,109
say that they could deal with it

59
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,110
having the right back at having the
right protection having the right people

60
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,500
in place or incident response that they
can respond

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,030
move the backups or mitigate anything
that some cyber attack might do

62
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:02,979
781 breaches of published public side
breeches with in 2015

63
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,599
now there's countless numbers I don't
fall into that area that require

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,280
companies to publicize that breathes so
mom and pop or anything like that or

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,349
that might be not even username or email
account compromise ation that they don't

66
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:24,190
even have to publicize so this is just
published side breeches with in 2015

67
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,169
now on the darknet those accounts that
are compromised that contain sensitive

68
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,820
information credit card numbers username
email password any PII personally

69
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,890
identifiable information can range from
anywhere from a hundred and fifty four

70
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,729
dollars to three hundred thirty or fifty
three dollars depending on that

71
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:49,090
information that is contained within
those those accounts over the last year

72
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,450
from 2014-2015 we saw an uptick of
thirty-eight percent of security

73
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,260
incidents

74
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,659
we're seeing that rampant increase in
the rampant security incidents

75
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,340
everywhere from the skimmers to skate
devices that we saw at target with the

76
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,659
HVAC and everything that there are
multiple ways that people are getting

77
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,990
into these environments getting these
accounts as we become more of a

78
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,580
connected device environment

79
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:26,050
and then that last 1 707 I'm going to
seven hundred and seven million think

80
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,770
about that

81
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,698
707 million records sold

82
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:39,490
here's the breakdown of that 707 million
by industry surprising to a lot of them

83
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,319
the biggest one is government we see
this because a lot of time because of

84
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,669
third-party actor

85
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:51,068
we see this a lot with a recent hack
that we saw with across multiple email

86
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,030
vendors and we saw a lot of emails
coming up with in Russia and everything

87
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,109
like that with gmail hotmail and yahoo
and everything else

88
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,520
health care which is the next biggest
one because all the pii all the records

89
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,779
within the healthcare that that have
your our home address your social

90
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,159
security number on it

91
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:17,259
your insurance information on it other
falls into categories that aren't listed

92
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,490
on here

93
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,580
don't ask me what it is because i think
this covers the majority of them

94
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,409
technology so this is industries like
that playstation network you're seeing

95
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,529
this within our investment industries or
anything like that

96
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,068
retail so that target that home depot
only accounts for six percent of that

97
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:42,940
707 million compromised accounts
education used to be the front runner

98
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:51,909
you because education was where you
would have the smallest budgetary aspect

99
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,529
for IP security

100
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,310
you didn't you you were worried too much
about IT security and some of the

101
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,599
educational fields back in the day and
that's what we saw a lot of breeches

102
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,889
with with schools online schools and
other of other areas of pulling tuition

103
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,759
information

104
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,020
home information for our contact
information just seems mean selling that

105
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,089
information off and surprisingly coming
in the last you have the financial

106
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,110
district

107
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:29,380
only one RR 1 percent of that 707
million accounts was from the financial

108
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,729
now this is just looking at accounts
with sensitive information in it this is

109
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,539
just looking at not just breaching the
account and getting the half this is

110
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,568
clear text passwords or username within
that

111
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:44,620
by the numbers

112
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,899
this is just 2016 so far you've had a
linkedin account

113
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,339
this doesn't this goes past all the
numbers that we looked at before this is

114
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,350
just what we're looking at now

115
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,800
linkedin 100 left are 17 million emails
and passwords compromise

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,790
these four big ones that we're seeing
here are just going to be focusing on

117
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,569
emails

118
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,660
username and password compromise nation
because this is where we're going to

119
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,550
start blending into the century NBA that
multiple email vendor that I talked

120
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,010
about before the gmail the hotmail yahoo
across the microsoft emails where we saw

121
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,300
over

122
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,729
Susan was it 270 million emails username
and password start surfacing up in the

123
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,699
the as you if you would

124
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:37,719
the Russian darknets the Verizon Verizon
with 1.5 emails passwords and

125
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,339
credentials and pii so this is billing
information credit card information this

126
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,300
home addresses phone numbers anything
like that that was one of the bigger

127
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,870
recent ones and another jpmorgan chase

128
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,899
this one was only 14 million in this

129
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:59,380
this was not only JP Morgan but i
believe 14 other subsidiaries of under

130
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,459
the umbrella of JPMorgan that had
compromised information of usernames

131
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,109
emails and password

132
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,740
so now we start getting into the century
mba what is century mba

133
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,170
century is a darknet tool that has just
now started to surface and more move

134
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,380
towards a more open source platform

135
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:28,160
it's easy to get now it's easy to use
very gooey and it's very module and it's

136
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,370
you can customize it you can make this
do whatever you wanted to do it was

137
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,209
meant as an automated prudential
stuffing tool where we all know about

138
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,589
brute forcing I'm just taking a username
throwing a hundred passwords added to

139
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:43,970
try to get that password

140
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,089
we know about a password spring of
taking the reverse of taking a hundred

141
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,420
usernames and throwing one password at
it and say if we can hit any of those

142
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,930
credential stuffing is taking that
breach information that I Ashley Madison

143
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,219
dump of usernames and passwords taking
that database tripping out the username

144
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,600
stripping out the password and importing
it into the tool and say hey here's your

145
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,690
list here is your user name list here is
your password list

146
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,060
what do i want to point it at YouTube
okay . are the excuse me a netflix how

147
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,209
many ppl reuse their username and
password across multiple different

148
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,709
vendors take that

149
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,800
let's throw that you two are on netflix
and see how many of those work

150
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:31,609
it's an open source framework as I
touched on before this is continuously

151
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:39,230
changing this is continuously changing
are not being modified by the users and

152
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,570
the developers you there's an open forum
on the century mba website where you can

153
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,890
say hey I want this feature on it and
I've seen within within a month a new

154
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,730
update come out for the new cents per
century to say okay well here's a new

155
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,529
module that was requested

156
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,529
here's the download for here is a
plug-in for it if you want it

157
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:03,800
the modular design is gives the users
exactly what they want only what they

158
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,709
want in a very streamlined approach it
utilizes a config and combo list so the

159
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:14,779
configs are something you can download
from as far as the breaches in combo

160
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,089
list you can import your own combo list
if you've got a a list of say you're

161
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,570
going after a in a database and you've
got a list of usernames default user

162
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,430
Samson default password you can import
it and say hey go after that that a web

163
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,069
facing database or anything like that
and pointed at it you can import proxy

164
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,370
lists into that that's one of my
favorite things with this is you've seen

165
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,870
a lot of stuff now

166
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,820
Fanning by IP where with authentication
so if you fail three times you're

167
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,370
blacklisted for 30 minutes on IP you
upload a proxy list to this as large as

168
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,330
you want

169
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,590
each individual authentication attempt
again against that portal that you're

170
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,170
going after will bounce proxy actor

171
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,130
you're no longer dealing with
blacklisting or timeouts or anything

172
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,720
like that and we're now we're starting
to see it ever since it started to

173
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,350
surface

174
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:15,640
you're starting to see this rampant in
the in the in the wild in the industry

175
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,960
I i I've had a couple different clients
with that I've dealt with that we've had

176
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,800
we've identified century being used to
some of the stuff i'll go through later

177
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,490
and then there's countless write-ups of
companies stepping in after breaches

178
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,600
that breach after breach after breach
after breaching their wondering how

179
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,460
these companies all these people are
getting in analyzing the traffic

180
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,590
analyzing the logs and they're seeing
hundreds of thousands of authentication

181
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:47,580
attempts and they're tying in fact the
century as

182
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,620
touchdown a second ago there are some
prerequisites with the century mba the

183
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,840
config file is something that you can
import you can download you can create

184
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,480
your own if you'd like the config file
basically tells century

185
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,580
what you want to go after where's the
portal it's a dub dub dub / login aw owa

186
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,660
if the custom one if it's a if it's got
custom fail fail entries if it's got

187
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,670
custom 404 errors

188
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,650
what's the validation that I've logged
in what is it looking for is it looking

189
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,990
for a keyword in the in the HTML that
says your account or anything like that

190
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,810
is it looking at arm

191
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,640
what's being replicated is it looking
what what does it want to do that config

192
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,810
file is something you can create or you
can have someone else create as I'll

193
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,819
show if you slide

194
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,760
they're everywhere no matter what you
wanted on for pokemon go for Spotify for

195
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
netflix for anything

196
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,920
they're out there the combo listen
wordless simple simple

197
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,550
username email directory lists common
user name

198
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,180
depending on what you're going after
kind of dictates what you want to import

199
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,829
into it if it's something like Netflix
that requires in a username are fueling

200
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,220
email rather than username you import a
difference

201
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,720
combo list rather than a user name which
will fail across the board and then the

202
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,640
proxy list once again this can be a list
of HTTP proxies or socks proxy that you

203
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,110
can download

204
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,270
there's how many different companies out
there they'll provide you with lists

205
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,600
there's a fun tool that I like to use a
proxy finder that'll just basically

206
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,190
reach out to the web

207
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:40,320
scrape all the proxies putting you into
an iso file that you can import century

208
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,460
mba really see that in here but century
that mba is the simple site to go to

209
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,050
with the

210
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,819
aviat that get anything off this site
you have to be authenticated within the

211
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,360
site and to create an account within
this site you have to have an invite

212
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,459
code to get the invite code you have to
basically go on and talk to people in

213
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:09,880
IRC channels dark web and either get
them from them get an invite code from

214
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,230
someone that's already got access or
there's people out there selling invite

215
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,190
codes anywhere from I've seen fifty
dollars all the way up to two hundred

216
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,550
and fifty dollars for an invite code
into the the device once you're in there

217
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,359
there's the clean download of century
NBA

218
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:35,680
there's a clean download of the terms of
the deal of config files that are

219
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:44,170
uploaded and combo lists can really see
down here 1,000 different config these

220
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,699
are just the simple configs you can see
some stuff up here there's pokemon go

221
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,529
there swag box there's path of exile

222
00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:04,059
domino's tribal CBS all different types
of groupon all different config files

223
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:09,220
that all you have to do it down will buy
these with gold which to get gold you

224
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,790
have the cash in bitcoins it's the only
thing they accept arm

225
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,010
import these configs within the century
NBA and point your list at it and go

226
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,390
here is just a sampling there's over a
thousand different combo list these are

227
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,010
just the larger ones hard to read but
here's a million combos hundred thousand

228
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,390
email combinations 5k porn combinations

229
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:41,440
I 13k 1.3 k all different list of just
list upon list of user name password

230
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,110
I email password or just known passwords
that people straight from these dumps

231
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,750
the other thing you use in within this
is all the dumps so the Ashley Madison

232
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,290
dump if you could get that off a
pastebin or anything that you see off

233
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,120
paceman you simply pull down and import
into your file it doesn't have to be a

234
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,959
combo list pulled down from from century
any combo with will work

235
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,840
now comes the fun part well this is all
theoretical

236
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:26,020
from now on this is this is things you
could do this is things that could be

237
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:33,520
done not say have been done or that
google images may I just

238
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,590
you're actually theoretical zone now yes
let's have some fun now

239
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,889
now we're past all the funds up on all
the boring stuff century

240
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,100
this is now getting into the actual tool

241
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,760
so if you were to boot up century you
wouldn't do and see firsthand

242
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,960
it's got some really weird artwork in it

243
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,240
I throughout the environment is really
kind of weird stuff kind of like this

244
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,080
you get a mermaid on one page you get
very weird things it does come with a

245
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,500
nice little disclaimer on the very first
thing that once you boot up a century

246
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,890
it's a windows based product won't work
in cali

247
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,830
ah so it has been run on windows that
machine but it does it does work very

248
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,080
easily and simply exe file that you just
load it

249
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,510
exactly if

250
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:36,990
if you were to ever install it and have
it its you should expect it to only work

251
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:45,330
on Windows but uh I i I've heard from
from from some some reddit reddit posts

252
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,520
are and twitch people were I got a lot
of stuff from twitch somewhat streaming

253
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,110
arm

254
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:59,520
so this is the image i came across when
I google image the the century mba tool

255
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,850
few things to porn out with in here

256
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:08,699
this is the landing page so heard arm of
the century and you've got a couple

257
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
different things on the side of the
general settings the headers if you want

258
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,070
to manipulate your header to basically
hide the user strings are hiding where

259
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,939
you are

260
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,150
the proxy setting if you've got a
specific property string that you want

261
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,740
to use the list down here is where your
import proxies and I'll get to that

262
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,040
later but the first thing right off the
bat you need to do is that config file

263
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,649
whether you're importing a config file
that you downloaded from the computer

264
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,680
that didn't work

265
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,350
that's the responsible again

266
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:59,800
all right whether you're downloading
this config from century or importing it

267
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,570
if you download the config file this
load snapshot is where that can figure

268
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,010
than it be loaded simply click that .
for the config file that you downloaded

269
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,900
from century or for many forms of
cracker forums or hacker form or

270
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,280
anything like that

271
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,370
they're out there just google search
century mba config and it's scary

272
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:27,610
the amount is out there already now if
you weren't gonna load config file and

273
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,540
you had a specific portal that you
wanted to point it at the citrate up

274
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,750
here is where you put that in that
specific URL of that you of that uh of

275
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,480
that authentication portal that you want
to go after

276
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,480
once you load a config file so I've
heard

277
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,820
it will populate the information already
for you so you'll see it loading Spotify

278
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,960
. com

279
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,580
spotify I've heard is it just it's a
it's a really easy one it was a recent

280
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,149
one kind of small sampling small
groupings

281
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,439
whoever did this just kind of chose it
because it was an easy one

282
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,330
now

283
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,470
x oh I like that tool to our proxy
finder

284
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,810
once I said once again I said proxies
from anywhere there is email change you

285
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,770
can subscribe to get a new proxy list
every 24 hours

286
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,850
proxy finder is a nice tool i will just
go out there scrape the the web and

287
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,409
import all the proxies

288
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:34,330
click Save and import them into the
century NBA tool so back under that

289
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,760
lists here you see proxy lists import
and it will give you all the information

290
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,650
of how many you've imported and it will
run a quick check on those proxy are

291
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,580
they active are they up and running will
they work with my with the century md a

292
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,480
tool

293
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:56,530
so you can see whoever did this imported
959 under 55 our students it's not 960

294
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,420
proxies for five more band so we've got
about nine hundred and fifty-five

295
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:09,130
proxies to work with word lists will go
down

296
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,510
ok wordless this is where those combo
lists are going to come into play

297
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,190
whether you get it from

298
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,740
ah that century the website whether you
import your own whether you have access

299
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,620
to a breach this

300
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,389
I've heard is from a breach this is
directly from a Spotify breach that has

301
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:33,400
happened and that was publicized on
pastebin and it's simple as the same

302
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,080
thing as the proxy

303
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,629
click word list click upload and upload
them now there's different things where

304
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,660
you can if you've got an actual
generated word list you can import it

305
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,290
here

306
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,430
if you've got just a list of usernames
that you like to use important here .

307
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,810
passwords it's very self-explanatory and
that's what's kind of so scary about

308
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,320
this

309
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:03,790
it's very gooey it very easy it's very
script kiddie ask of . click go back now

310
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,520
that you have everything you've got the
word list

311
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,650
you've got the proxies you've got your
your area you want to attack or go after

312
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,060
authenticated time

313
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,200
now you move down to the progression tab

314
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,190
and this is where you can kind of
customize some features within the

315
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,510
actual attempt

316
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,810
so you can list the number of the choose
the number of box that you want this

317
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:33,649
incremental amount of actual attempt
made at that that website the one

318
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,990
individual count that time all the way
up to a hundred of I want a hundred

319
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,160
attempts off of my list at a time if it
fails bounce the proxy and test another

320
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,560
email our customer password

321
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,110
the wordless position here is where if
you start something and have to end it

322
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,719
and you only get through say 15 accounts

323
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,630
you don't have to start at the very
beginning you can start that word list

324
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,710
wherever you want that you if you got
through 25 attempts

325
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,020
move it - 26 and start on that 26
account this is where you're going to

326
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,310
start seeing once you start the actual
attack of where you're going to see a

327
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,090
lot of the information you're going to
see the custom 404 that pop up

328
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,010
whether it's a 40 for 200 or any other
specific code you will get the progress

329
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,379
total number of attempts that it's made

330
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,810
remember to retries of unauthenticated
or areas and the proxy list of the

331
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:31,129
number of processes that used and then
the results you're going to get the

332
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,770
number hit you're going to get the all
the information number left to do and

333
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,300
then down here and into this information
will give you actually what's going on

334
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,639
in the environment so i will caveat this
with once again this is a theoretical if

335
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,350
someone would ever do this

336
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,590
it's hypothetical

337
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,000
this is I maybe slides and paint

338
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,740
so yeah so if we were if this was to
actually go active yes no

339
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:13,519
no that's a number of sequential 100 I'm
gonna attempt

340
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,029
it's going to open a hundred different
exactly

341
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:27,889
yeah yeah so once it goes it goes
progress sitting at thirty-one percent

342
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:31,609
right now we have 26 hits already

343
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:38,599
this is information pulled down directly
from a a breach heard this is directly

344
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:42,708
this information that you're taking that
are open source on pastebin on the

345
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:51,919
configs on our on open on the internet
this is not stuff that takes any skill

346
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,409
set to get it may take some skill set to
get the tool itself because yeah you can

347
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:03,349
download century mba from a lot of
different areas run it in sandbox and

348
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:09,110
then check yourself but uh it's not

349
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,479
- do you upload a couple of files let it
go and you can see here is a username a

350
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
test

351
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,909
here's the password attempts if it's a
if it's a user or email and password you

352
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,530
put in here and then you'll see here all
the different things that the password

353
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,460
failed

354
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,559
I can see you see source successful
keyword found your account

355
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,270
that's that config file saying this is
how it note that if you're into the

356
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,960
account

357
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,030
you're going to see in the HTML code
your account so can see your account

358
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,080
that was poetic successful successful
excuse me and it will populate it with

359
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,428
in this hits down here and they will
tell you what the user name is what the

360
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:54,950
password is where is a cat that why you
found an attack and what proxy used to

361
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,240
do it

362
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,080
he also see this it failed attempts the
keyword found incorrect username or

363
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,439
password and as you can see it's
bouncing proxy every single time it hits

364
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,490
so you're not having black are
blacklisting you're not having time out

365
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,400
or anything like that

366
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:20,929
let go a little bit longer I've heard
this only took about 10 minutes arm took

367
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:27,770
me longer to create the the actual paint
images but arm hundred percent done

368
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:37,700
275 active accounts logged into out of
519

369
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:45,860
so after that breach 275 people did not
change passwords on that account

370
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,429
that's a scary

371
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:52,580
there's a scare he could thing right
there is how many of these different

372
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,480
accounts

373
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,120
can i take like i said before and that .
that Spotify let's . that netflix but .

374
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,860
. at you baby let's . it up a pal let's
point out a bank account fifth third

375
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,409
credit union 1 our bank of america USA
eh whatever it may be

376
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,639
what else can I do with this and this is

377
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,940
a small sampling we saw some of those
other config files and some of those

378
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:31,170
other list of millions millions of user
name he millions of passwords and we're

379
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,880
seeing it involving revolving you in
just the time that I have been working

380
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,780
with this this product arm

381
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:46,740
I've seen it go through five different
iterations scene features dropped

382
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,900
features add this isn't a keyhole thing
that not meant to do just credential

383
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,550
stuffing of pulling in the password from
breaches you can make this do anything

384
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,300
you want as far as authentication
council brute-forcing if you wanted to

385
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,470
do non proxy and you want to set timers
for to do I want to do an account every

386
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,510
30 seconds

387
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,110
I want to do an attempt every 30 seconds
that can do that if you've got a custom

388
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,610
list that you wanted to put use you can
do that if you wanted a specific URL

389
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:21,510
it does - it doesn't have to be a config
file from century or so are someone

390
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:28,140
else's created you can create your own
if you know your own thing if you say

391
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,100
you wanted

392
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,110
theoretically to go after a bank I don't
know the inner workings of that website

393
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,889
I go to Joe schmo's credit union

394
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,350
open up an account but five bucks in it
I've got now access to online banking

395
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:48,629
I now have a a username password that
gets me into their banking system

396
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,090
now i know i can say what validates
within that banking system

397
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,030
what the validation of login is what's a
validation of failed attempts is I can

398
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,470
create my own config download one of
those million attempt things and pointed

399
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:11,250
at that bank can go to town and I think
it takes no more than that it's all as

400
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,260
deep as you want to get into this

401
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,600
the user influence as i said before is
is rampant throughout it

402
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,939
the forms on that century mba once you
get access to it are riddled with plus

403
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,820
ins features that people have custom
written to add into it as far as other

404
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,860
things that they wanted to do the
configs you can find anywhere on the

405
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,850
internet doesn't have to be within that
century md a website

406
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,899
they're just once I'd like I said again
google it

407
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,130
it will be scary the amount you come
back with a quick cracking forms are all

408
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,470
over the hacking forms are all over it

409
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,240
I even just open source read it forms
are all over it just as far as hey I use

410
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,900
netflix you're seeing people do the
netflix just because i don't want to pay

411
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,510
for netflix account I don't want to pay
for spotify account

412
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,400
well i got 207 book theoretically at 275
accounts

413
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:13,630
well whoever didn't it arm one of the
latest things I've seen that's getting

414
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:19,990
pretty advanced pretty little bit scary
now also is all these companies are

415
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,400
going to captures captures on their
website that beat the automated tools to

416
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:34,870
beat the arm to beat the the box out
there just of from stop people from just

417
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,889
crawling

418
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:42,670
there's now cad death by capture plugin
for this where it'll it can be capture X

419
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:50,560
in 6a successfully be the Google's API
capture which is said to be the market

420
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,629
for the the trademark of everyone to go
after that is the the best one

421
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,100
I don't know how it works but basically
you import that plug in into the device

422
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,480
and you say go if it hit the capture

423
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:13,030
it's got OCR within it that will
identify the information from it and as

424
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,460
I

425
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,730
said before we've seen it in the wild

426
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,950
not only have I seen it in the wild with
companies that I have worked for

427
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:27,020
companies that I've done assessments for
and they come back to us to say hey we

428
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,850
just got hit with a an attack there was
a abnormal amount of authentication

429
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,899
attempts

430
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:38,510
no account lockout but it just generated
an enormous amount of models within our

431
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,720
lips syslog server of the authenticated
attempts

432
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,830
this was a security company that did
this

433
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,710
did a white paper on it when it first
went public last year arm

434
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:58,520
they stepped into environment that had
had multiple accounts breached multiple

435
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,408
identity stolen multiple fraudulent
actions within the company and they were

436
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:07,820
mediate one within a week that have
another one hit for mediated with have

437
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,290
another one another one fits our another
one hit and they were to a point where

438
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,980
they didn't know what was going on so
they hired this this third party

439
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:21,320
companies step in and they looked at a
month

440
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,790
just a month of sampling data from sem
birth from december to january 2015 2016

441
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:36,500
one week in december five million login
attempts

442
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,339
I'm fortune 100 business the car
consumer sites

443
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:46,730
so these are places where credit cards
are being passed credit cards could be

444
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,168
stored personal information far as
shipping red records emails passwords

445
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:57,230
into that account anything like that are
being stored being utilized five million

446
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:04,520
in one week time period over to date
time . in january two large retailers

447
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:15,290
saw 2014 - 20,000 login attempts two
days in the odd one major vendor saw two

448
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,670
different attacks

449
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:24,980
what I was single day in January with a
large retailer saw arm 10,000 login

450
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,490
attempt

451
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,689
these are

452
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:32,839
not big you can see some of those config
files there's a list of 300,000 out

453
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,509
there there's list of a million there's
a list of anything

454
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:43,130
these are very targeted attacks and
we're starting to see them move not only

455
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:49,640
from the web based aspect into the
mobile aspect you you can run this off

456
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,240
of and pointed at mobile devices running
off an SDK and basically pointed at the

457
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:07,939
mobile authentication pages utilize not
only a web based on mobile as I

458
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,350
before that identification of century
with an environment is a big thing there

459
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,650
are default user strings that are always
present

460
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,640
no matter if you change the are the HTTP
settings within that settings tab there

461
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,450
are these 5 user strings that are always
present this is the tell-tale sign of a

462
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,810
half-century being used because the big
thing that they use off of it is an

463
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:40,960
outdated older version of Mozilla
Firefox within it

464
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,020
so it's mozilla 5 . o arm

465
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,230
these have been tied directly to the
century tax even the latest version of

466
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,730
the one put one point one point one
point four point one still has these

467
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,930
embedded in them and these are an easy
way if you see within your logs to

468
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:07,690
identify of a potential century century
attack the other thing is so awesome in

469
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:14,080
web OS is God arm the threat hand book
outlines everything you need to do to

470
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,170
set up precautions around this

471
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,570
so monitoring logs company that saw the
the Six Million attempts

472
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:29,020
where's the sysadmin monitoring those
logs where is alerting within those logs

473
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,009
say you know what

474
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,230
in a 24-hour period i've had 20,000
failed attempts

475
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:41,620
where's the alert where the email
where's the where's where's the person

476
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,910
identifying that are not identical
person but where's the alerting for that

477
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,910
wears the red flag great uh raised up

478
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:54,460
abnormal authentication levels 20,000
don't care the size of year

479
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,980
well i do , sighs your company 20,000
failed login attempts i would imagine

480
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:06,310
it's pretty pretty pretty high even for
say something like a an Amazon are not

481
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,660
in the Amazon

482
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,399
now they're there for

483
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,220
because you're going to have stuff
crawling in all the time but it's

484
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,770
something to keep an eye out for armed
increased failed authentication and

485
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:26,000
reductive were shooting our accounts
being used multiple times over and over

486
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,150
over again for different activities as
far as logins at different times if

487
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,770
there's two account active at the same
time in different areas different ip's

488
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:41,359
alerting in monitoring of that
information is the biggest thing that's

489
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,828
going to be there there's nothing that's
going to stop century NBA all together

490
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:51,440
with but there are ways to help prevent
it with complex passwords proper

491
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,329
alerting arm and maintenance of systems

492
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:00,079
hi did not start that long enough haha

493
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:17,599
I've talking about any questions if if
you theoretically wanted to buy gold

494
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:28,700
I think when someone bought gold it was
twenty dollars for free or 3,000 of our

495
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,970
twenty dollars worth of a bitcoin for
three thousand gold

496
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:39,500
so if we go back to we go back to the
actual thing give you an idea

497
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:49,460
- config so let's see pokemon goal is
one goal

498
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,789
I some of the larger ones that have
captures that have everything in in it

499
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:56,630
already

500
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,279
so that's the breach data that's the UH
the configuration the usernames and

501
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:05,539
passwords the proxy list everything like
that that comes with a capture are going

502
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,730
to be a little bit more so you see right
here

503
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,539
api amazon proxy list is 15 on that so

504
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,940
ten bucks for that config I

505
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,569
the combo lists are usually a little bit
more you see some of the larger ones who

506
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:23,220
has a 10,000 I that's 1.4 million user
names and passwords

507
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:31,470
this is loc 291,000 emails and passwords
the config files are a little bit larger

508
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,839
but once again there's other places you
can go to get this stuff paste in recon

509
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,599
ng will feed you some of this
information

510
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,270
if you've got 60 grand to spend on a
pony list API you've got the access to

511
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:50,250
every single breach database that you
that would be out there but once again

512
00:40:50,250 --> 00:41:03,390
that 60 grand to get that API and with a
two factor authentication that will get

513
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:08,700
there there's no there's no tions to it
right now as far as being able it being

514
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,379
able to utilize that so that is a great
feature or a great thing to have on

515
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,380
amazon anything like that to wear it yet

516
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:38,368
I haven't seen that but the one thing
that I don't know there is one

517
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:44,700
this guy google is huge on century oh
well that's our if you spend that you

518
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,069
use a certain amount of gold you get

519
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:53,730
what the hell do they call it not donors
it's another status but you get a gold

520
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,700
label and you get access to the back end
of it

521
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,129
so you get a lot of deb access you get a
lot more of the stuff that isn't out on

522
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,430
the public-facing yeah

523
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,060
mhm yes failed login attempts

524
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:21,980
yes in one month . after the fact that
this is this is them

525
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,680
I a third-party security company
stepping into a a large retailer large

526
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,440
parent company retailer

527
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:41,720
yeah I don't know this was going on

528
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,799
yeah oh I'd imagine a very large amount
or of it

529
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,940
I got like we all know it only takes one
to get in but if you're going for mass

530
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,040
our account compensation in a one-month
period you're hitting six billion who

531
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,040
failed our login attempts on the on the
portals

532
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,200
absolutely

533
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,589
exactly another form of it

534
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,050
yep

535
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,880
now

536
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,790
we're of right now i have seen that with
what I've heard that that's within the

537
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,470
forums of the device and I do see a lot
of people asking for being able to link

538
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:36,310
multiple instances of century together
to basically do larger scale attacks and

539
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:43,150
larger scale authentication attempts but
currently no harm Jesus

540
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:48,970
yep mhm

541
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:56,770
absolutely yeah

542
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:13,810
mhm be able to scrape those proculus
together and have the same list that

543
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:18,759
these are all I'd someone use just an
open source proxy list though that's

544
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,370
available to anyone you can tie that to
exact back to the proxy list which gives

545
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,870
you another thread that possibly could
be a century involved

546
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:33,279
anything else

547
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,080
all right thank you

548
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,430
yeah
