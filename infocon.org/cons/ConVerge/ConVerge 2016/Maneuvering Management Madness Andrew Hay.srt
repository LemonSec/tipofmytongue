1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I was expecting a lot

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,500
my mother would be very unimpressed with
that introduction

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,450
yeah do it again here

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,560
Adrian you don't want to be in here
because you've heard all these jokes

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,430
before

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,840
so my name is Andrew hey i am the sea so
at data gravity-based of national New

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,560
Hampshire

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,320
I get to work in san francisco and live
in San Francisco because i wasn't going

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,059
to move in nashua new hampshire

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,239
so a little bit about me whoo

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:44,520
so Andrew hay before this job at data
gravity I and i've only been there since

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,309
january i was the director of research
at opendns now Cisco not my fault I

13
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:51,419
swear

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,120
chief evangelist a cloud passage they're
still cloud passage and is an industry a

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,280
dirty dirty industry analyst 451
research for any three years I've also

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,180
worked in the trenches as a practitioner
for university in western canada was

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,470
interesting and banking bermuda and I
actually did live and work in Bermuda

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,869
which sounds a lot cooler than it
actually was I was also i think

19
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,030
employees 34 something at you on labs
which was acquired by IBM and all my

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,200
friends are rich

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:37,170
I am NOT I've also written four books
now that judging by my statements none

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,040
of you read

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,770
so that's awesome and I spent an awful
lot of time on planes and I'm getting to

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,429
the point now where so i flew yesterday
my butt's actually still sore from

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,439
sitting in coach yesterday

26
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,439
I'm gonna blame old age on that one

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,570
so what we're going to talk about today
is when I was coming up from in the

28
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,419
trenches to where I am now and some
would probably rightly say that I did

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,660
jump a few steps right place at the
right time so i made a lot of mistakes

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,510
and I did a lot of things really really
wrong when dealing with managers are

31
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,980
some could say that it's because I'm an
only child and i really like to get my

32
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,030
way

33
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,470
others might say that hunt just a jerk
and others might say that I'm just

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,989
insecurities so that's the way it goes

35
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,989
so what I want to do is give a
presentation

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,069
i should also say that i've recently so
I met by one more class to go towards a

37
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:46,230
leadership and management certificate at
Berkeley and it's a lot of the things

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,959
that I've learned there and have paid
for

39
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,950
I think should be common knowledge for
people in our industry without having to

40
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,290
go pay for it because I'm cheap and now
you can be too

41
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,190
so what I wanted to do is give a talk on
how to work with management how to

42
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,760
communicate with management in a way
that is going to resonate with them

43
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,980
it may feel dirty at first but trust me
it

44
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,060
it gets better the more you practice
this is going really hard now

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,930
ok get that thought out of your head
it's really more around how to

46
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,420
communicate in an effective way as
opposed to just demanding something not

47
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,790
getting it and then storming off pouting
stomping your feet and running away

48
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,720
so if you can get what you want from
your management team from your direct

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,209
superior from the executive branch

50
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,910
I'm hoping that at the end of this talk
you'll have a couple ideas that you can

51
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,720
walk away with that can help you

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,079
you know twist that knife a little bit
but in a constructive way

53
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:05,500
so I'm going to go through a couple of
things here sometimes they're thought of

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,790
as biased views towards the
practitioners and the biased views

55
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:20,769
towards the the management here i'll say
I and one thing is complaining

56
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,770
so we as security practitioners we love
to complain and say that it's

57
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,030
constructive criticism or it's the right
way to do things because you know we are

58
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,710
the people we are the boots on the
ground we are the ones who are seeing

59
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:41,260
everything as it burns to the ground so
we know what's going on

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,480
therefore we should be trusted when we
come to management to say something they

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,620
would disagree with that

62
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,420
well first are there any managers in the
room currently do you disagree with that

63
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,680
yes yes no sometimes ok

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,990
practitioners are very close to the
technology now I'm not saying that we as

65
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,760
practitioners use practitioners believe
that technology is going to solve

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,440
everything but we work with technology
on a daily basis so we know what the

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,090
capabilities are we know what can't be
done with technology what has to be done

68
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,469
with people and we we just understand
that because we deal with it every day

69
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:31,210
when we think of objectives as security
people we think all right

70
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,180
we are hired to protect the business and
all the constituents from harm

71
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,900
we want to make sure that the business
keeps running

72
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,190
and if it keeps running and is safe and
secure than we've earned our paycheck

73
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,820
hopefully if not then you probably just
don't want to be working where you're

74
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,820
working but that's the ideal view

75
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,340
so our measure success is no continuity
privacy

76
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,099
it's going to be achieved in a
continuous fashion

77
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,740
so when we hear compliance audit someone
checks the box and you get like the nice

78
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,210
little gold star that we've you know hey
we're PCI compliant like that doesn't

79
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,820
matter as a security person like now

80
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,520
not all that important because you know
that minutes after that gold star goes

81
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,960
up on the wall

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
that doesn't mean that there's an end in
sight there's no angle you haven't

83
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,000
reached it

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,290
so there's still more stuff to do ideas

85
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,530
so we are very smart we are very
intelligent people we like to

86
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,450
communicate our ideas sometimes not in
the most effective way

87
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,469
hence the talk and negotiating because
we see ourselves as the closest people

88
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,330
to the technology with the hands-on
practical experience we tend to think of

89
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,969
ourselves as the authority when we
discover something or when we report

90
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,910
something because we are the ones who
are fiddling with the knobs and actually

91
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:14,070
putting out the fires now the management
view it's not completely different but

92
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,469
it's different enough to warrant
different things to care were to

93
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,540
consider and to really worry about
complaining

94
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,400
so when your manager one of the first
things you do is learn how to compete

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,840
how to complain constructively and this
is either through like formal education

96
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,440
through workshops that when you're going
through feel like the dumbest thing

97
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,910
you've ever been through

98
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:47,010
I've been through a lot of them they are
infuriating but you are communicating on

99
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,890
behalf of the business and your your job
is to make the troops understand you're

100
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,979
passing down the word from the top of
the chain and you're trying to make them

101
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,710
understand in a way that is constructive

102
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,710
and not inflammatory

103
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,700
so technology as manager

104
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,570
you know if technology goes away
tomorrow can you still do your job can

105
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,190
you still produce the widgets

106
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,590
maybe I in all likelihood know but that
thought of

107
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,849
we just use technology to speed things
up to make things more accurate to make

108
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,890
our supply chain go faster

109
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:30,120
it's it really is a means to an end now
in terms of objectives managers or

110
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,720
leaders are brought on to like I said
communicate the business priorities down

111
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,560
to the walk the paper down to the
engineers

112
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,530
you're really your job is really to make
the business succeed and make your

113
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,120
people successful

114
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,840
so sometimes those see Matt ends and
that's i would say that's the difference

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,890
between a leader and a manager manager
is pushing stuff from point a to point

116
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:02,069
be a leader will inspire the people
under them or in another team to want to

117
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,310
move stuff from point A to point B job
well done every going goes home

118
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,939
nobody gets hurt business keeps running

119
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:20,190
so it's not about putting the fastest
net most next generation + + 2 . know

120
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,080
whatever in place

121
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,200
it's making sure that the business is
operational within the tolerance of the

122
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,650
organization and negotiating

123
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,180
it's not my way or the highway kind of
thing or at least it shouldn't be again

124
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,209
differentiation between a manager and a
leader

125
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,160
it should be a when you're negotiating
something from the management here

126
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,330
you want to arrive at the most amicable
decision for both the business and for

127
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,090
the individual and it's not always easy

128
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,300
sometimes people just want to watch the
world burn

129
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,649
so they'll be stubborn

130
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:06,910
so I i love this picture by the way I
made this

131
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:15,610
patent pending so people when they think
of how managers talk think of someone

132
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,410
fresh out of business school

133
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:25,809
what are some of the the management BS
bingo courage words that come up or come

134
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:26,529
to mind

135
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,759
they don't want to chime in roi

136
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,079
ya see it that team synergies

137
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:43,119
yeah shifting some paradigms outside of
the box to collaborate more efficiencies

138
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:47,920
yeah thats better yet

139
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,490
we're going to have a meeting to discuss
the future meetings that we need to

140
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,529
drill down

141
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:59,110
yeah and this does anyone just have like
a guttural reaction to hearing these

142
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,300
things a lot of people do some people
just kinda to note i'm at the point

143
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,040
where you know it's just language its
business language they're going to use

144
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,939
it

145
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:14,620
although i still cringe at it is what it
is

146
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,910
what what what is what is it

147
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,920
or at the end of the day oh you mean
like today I love screw with people like

148
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,120
that i mean like today today or the end
of which day specifically

149
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,870
so if you know how if your management
and typically you'll see this the higher

150
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,579
up the food chain you go there will be
certain words that they are used to

151
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,170
using with their peers

152
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,649
so if you can become a polyglot speak
you know normal human English and speak

153
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:55,600
some of the management tier-i I so don't
want to say bullshit over and over again

154
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,439
but it's not it's it's a higher level of
language

155
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,149
so if you think of programming languages
who here knows assembly

156
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,069
one person really

157
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,370
let's see that was kinda get man at one
point you assembly

158
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:21,060
I know 6800 assembly so practical this
day and age but I also you know I know

159
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,390
Ruby and Python those are higher level
scripting languages where assembly is a

160
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,230
low-level language so they're not they
are different

161
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,130
can they be used to do the same thing
with a little work yes but you can still

162
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,680
get the job done is only with either
unless you hate Ruby and then you're

163
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,430
just a jerk because sometimes I want to
use Ruby Python

164
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:52,140
so just think of it as a different
communication style

165
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,830
so here are some of my favorites that
I've heard along the way low hanging

166
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,730
fruit

167
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,770
a lot of words and whimsy to describe
something that's easy and it's true

168
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,490
like I have vulnerabilities let's get
rid of all the low-hanging fruit or

169
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,209
let's prove the tree of low-hanging
fruit first and then we'll then we'll

170
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,270
what go apple picking in a bigger
orchard

171
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:22,410
all right facetime so unless like my
mother who says facetime meaning skype

172
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,540
google whatever like any sort of
communication medium facetime usually

173
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,540
just means a face-to-face meeting but
clarify

174
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,350
let's take this conversation offline or
touch base later

175
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,320
this is a very careful way of saying I
don't want to talk to you about this

176
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,550
right now

177
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,510
it's much more polite let's take this
offline or this

178
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,170
this may not be the time to discuss this
let's let's put a pin in this circle

179
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,430
back that I think outside the box

180
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,110
there are so many thoughts out of the
box in this day and age now because of

181
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,550
this stupid phrase but it really is just
think of a different way to do something

182
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,589
so living in San Francisco

183
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,589
I can walk a block and probably hear
pivot about six times

184
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,990
it's really the best way to communicate
that

185
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,260
the first idea sucked the second idea
was kind of iffy

186
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,939
so we changed our mind and we're going
to do something else but it's made its

187
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,970
way into the business dictionary as a
proper term like I'll just you know it

188
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,420
doesn't work with pivot will pivot on
this idea and do something else

189
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:36,719
paradigm it's just it's it's ubiquitous
now paradigm

190
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,720
it's just a model to get the point
across

191
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,529
most managers use it as a model to
explain what a paradigm is so it's a

192
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,470
paradigm paradigms deep dive peel the
onion

193
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,370
I hate peel back the onion
defense-in-depth methodology

194
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,010
blah blah blah it's really just a
detailed overview or a thorough

195
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,080
examination of an issue

196
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,399
feel free to print these often with them
in your cube for your office by the way

197
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,500
boil the ocean I if you work for a
product company especially one that does

198
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,330
development this will come up a lot
especially with product managers or

199
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,920
product marketing folks because they
don't want to boil the ocean they just

200
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,839
want to simply deliver the synergy is
required in order to enable the business

201
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,930
to succeed in their hockey stick growth
so will the ocean

202
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,449
hey let's not trying to do absolutely
everything let's just pick off some of

203
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,390
the really good things to do

204
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,390
anyone playing pokemon right now by the
way

205
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:46,740
ah shit should we go outside under a
tree and have pokemon talk

206
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,899
alright so move the needle this is we
want to move the needle

207
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,279
we need to really disrupt things and I
should have put disrupt on there too but

208
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:02,310
moving if we want to make things better
make it have an impact end of the day

209
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,849
again I already told you and I probably
threw up in my mouth a little bit when I

210
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,630
said it

211
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,380
they don't mean the physical into the
work day but it is still fun to screw

212
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,529
with people if they say at the end of
the day back burner

213
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,850
let's put on the back burner meaning
again polite way of let's not talk about

214
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,660
this right now because whatever i'm
talking about is far more important what

215
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,520
you're bringing up right now

216
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,750
I d8 they won't hurt that used this is
one of the newer ones you know form an

217
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,100
idea not

218
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,220
let's discuss an idea that we should i
be eight that problem

219
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:41,220
really all right pardon me

220
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:50,790
yeah or confab obviate is another one

221
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,620
so as an analyst I read a lot of these
words are as a former analyst I brought

222
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,130
a lot of these words in other people's
reports and I just kind of shut her like

223
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,150
all the copy desk thanks your God
because you use all these great words

224
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,349
from business school

225
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:10,020
so obviate the need to obviate the need
for x we remove it

226
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,910
leverage i'll be honest i use leverage
quite a bit because you know it's just

227
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,980
enabling something and it's it's a lot
smaller word than some of the other

228
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,810
things that you could use by and we
gotta get buy-in for this project

229
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,270
well no you just have to obviate the
need for it huh

230
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:38,250
see so those were the good words you
know and I use the term loosely good i'm

231
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:44,490
gonna go over some of the bad words from
a career limiting move standpoint that

232
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,650
I've gone through and I've experienced
over the years never tell your boss that

233
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,290
you can't or won't do something

234
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,780
it's it's an emotional response and
you're just you know you're shooting

235
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,610
from the hip not can't do it

236
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,969
overworked no I don't want to do that
that's stupid that dump

237
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:11,910
it's all I used that Italian so you
don't use them together either so if you

238
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,910
are if you can't do something

239
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,350
what you and i'll show you how to
communicate a little bit better and

240
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,250
really the optimal way I find that works
because it kind of twist the minds of

241
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,860
the people that are trying to get you to
do something

242
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,149
this if you say can't or won't you're
immediately labeled as not a team player

243
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,740
and it's something that's very hard to
shake

244
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,100
it's easy to get on the shit list it's
very hard to get off the shit list

245
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,830
and if anyone is sensitive about the
language i was in the navy and I'm not

246
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,590
going to apologize for that and my CEO
swears like a sailor so she's and she

247
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,209
swears like a sailor

248
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,600
so they're stupid

249
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,080
never say an idea or someone is stupid

250
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,428
we should go by accident ability
scanning software that's stupid

251
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:07,169
we just use open source tools for a dumb
idea again an emotional response

252
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,139
it's not something that you should be
saying because you were insulting the

253
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,790
person you may not

254
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,710
it might just be something that you're
used to saying like on Twitter and just

255
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,010
so you know Twitter in real life two
different mediums

256
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,379
you can say yeah I know weird huh also
pokemon not real

257
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,990
ok

258
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,280
yeah if if you go and try and throw
balls at a dog or something

259
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,870
one you're in a punch in the face and
too little probably be me

260
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,940
so don't tell people their ideas are
stupid if you the real master way of

261
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,300
doing this is to convince them that your
idea is the better idea

262
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:01,159
the phd level way is convinced them that
your idea was their idea and is an

263
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,809
awesome idea that makes them feel like
they're geniuses and you tell them so

264
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,990
so they're telling that them that their
idea is stupid you're telling them that

265
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,250
their idea that they came up with that
you had the privilege of listening to

266
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,309
was the best idea I've ever heard

267
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:22,520
that's a good way to get back off of
that list so wrong

268
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,070
bad idea wrong idea nobody likes being
told that their thought was not the

269
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,700
right way to do something and it's just
hardwired into us so unless you are a

270
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,880
complete introverted or a sociopath

271
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,830
this usually won't really faze you too
much

272
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,600
if you are a complete sociopath there's
other problems in the business world

273
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,760
you're probably you're probably an
executive so in sales so I wouldn't

274
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,970
worry too much about that one of the
ones that i really want to communicate

275
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,340
to you is if you're if you've been asked
to explain something

276
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:11,300
never start your sentence with I feel or
I believe because that's you know

277
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:19,010
another whimsical word that doesn't have
a lot of you know there's no point to it

278
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,040
there's no impact you're not really
saying

279
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,940
hi folks I'm here

280
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,240
unfortunately we had yet another product
of a medias i am looking at something

281
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,960
else and so I'm adding a little bit of
extra commentary - and this video be

282
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,720
sitting right next to me anyway so you
can put his own and put in and what he

283
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,200
thinks that a media and various video
capture devices

284
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,730
can anybody say thanks to have a media
thanks have a media anyway video should

285
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,530
resume again at 27 minutes 48 seconds
mark sorry for inconvenience

286
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,260
not select

287
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,560
no spoiler it's probably not that
important

288
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,030
so do a cost-benefit assessment is what
you're asking going to burn political

289
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,280
capital that you want to use later

290
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,120
and should you be spending that capital

291
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:18,650
she just hang on to it you should also
you know can you go and discuss this

292
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:24,440
with your superior with whomever you're
trying to go to and can you do it in an

293
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,730
emotionless way

294
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:32,240
can you communicate facts can you
communicate really the raw data and the

295
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,840
problem without going in there like an
impetuous child

296
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,370
most of the time you can

297
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,570
so that's usually the stop by tonight
okay I'm gonna go take a walk count to

298
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,379
ten

299
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,140
whatever then I'll come back and I'll
think see if i can do it again

300
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,030
considered a management point of view

301
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:56,090
this is probably the biggest challenge
that we as practitioners and us

302
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:03,139
practitioners will have because you are
so most of the times you are so far

303
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:09,350
removed from the executive branch or the
decision makers and you feel that you're

304
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,669
just a cog

305
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,160
well you know what a whole bunch of cogs
need to turn in unison in certain ways

306
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,230
in order for the business to operate so
you need to step back and say okay is

307
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,680
what i'm asking for what am i what I'm
demanding

308
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,810
is that something that's going to
negatively or positively impact the

309
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:35,060
business is going to make me happy is it
going to make all of my peers happy is

310
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,350
it going to make our customers happy and
it's hard because if you do if you've

311
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,270
never thought that way before

312
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:48,200
it's a very it's an awkward way of
thinking of things because really it's

313
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,010
it's an insular kind of thing when
you're sitting behind the keyboard at

314
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,510
three in the morning trying to fix a
firewall rule for some reason

315
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,620
so you think okay well if I get this
firewall rule working with the business

316
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,110
case well I don't have to pay me another
hour or I don't have to take I don't get

317
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,699
vacation for another hour

318
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,100
I can go home and go to bed see my wife
and kids play with my dog no that's

319
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,309
that's not what is best for the business

320
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:23,850
sorry I'm here area and this is a big
one

321
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:32,610
decide what your boss should be doing so
I'll let you in on a little secret

322
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:39,300
the higher up the food chain you go even
though it may not look like they are

323
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,669
busy but those people are extremely busy
so just like reporters and I saw someone

324
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:52,440
I think Nick's lb put it on Twitter this
morning that journalists are not miners

325
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,370
their metal workers they will build
whatever you give them and it's the same

326
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,050
thing with management

327
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:04,919
if you give them ideas they'll start
constructing what the right course of

328
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,010
action is if you give them the course of
action

329
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,090
hey you just save them a whole bunch of
time so if you can try and figure out

330
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,919
what you want your boss to do and then
construct the paths and the argument to

331
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,270
get them to do it

332
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,150
you're making their jobs easier because
they don't have to make those decisions

333
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:28,590
and they may look to you and say okay
this person actually get it or doesn't

334
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,780
get it was a horrible idea but you know
what

335
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:37,710
think it through and take a chance so
build a business case i learned this

336
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,910
very early on

337
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:45,929
so does anyone work for a company that
just flat out refuses to send them on

338
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:50,910
training or two conferences that you
think is like that you personally think

339
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,500
is good for you to grow one person

340
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,850
two people one and a half people ok so
times have changed

341
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:06,129
apparently so I when I was a QR labs we
didn't get to go anywhere unless it was

342
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,900
local in the city because it's not
something that the company wanted to

343
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,740
invest in

344
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,270
so travel training you were hired to do
a job it was even worse in Bermuda

345
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,740
because you are hired to do that
specific job and if you went above and

346
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,890
beyond that job there was actually a
hotline that

347
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,070
bermudian locals could call to say hey
this guy's going outside of his job

348
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,270
requirements and you could have your
work permit revoked and be deported

349
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:37,690
good times good times beautiful paradise
not to work in

350
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:45,190
so what I learned is when I was a q1 was
how to create a business case and and

351
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,540
I'll go through the example in a little
bit but it helped communicate what I

352
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:55,180
wanted to do and outlined all the costs
associated with so that my manager can

353
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,760
look at it and say yeah that's in the
budget let's go

354
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,150
or that's not in the budget but it's
discretionary not a big deal

355
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,670
focus on the facts again this is where
you're disconnecting from the emotions

356
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,510
you just want to say this is the factual
information and this will all come

357
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,520
together in some examples I promise

358
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,800
look forward don't look backwards when
you're going through this if they said

359
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,080
no don't focus when you're coming back a
second time that they focused and sorry

360
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,820
that they said no the last time

361
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,919
just focus on the optimal outcome what's
what's going to come

362
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,210
what how this is going to benefit you in
the future and the company etc etc

363
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,870
don't focus on the past don't dwell on
the past

364
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,649
and the last one is that if this is a
group problem and that arguably this

365
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:50,439
could be further near the beginning but
if it's a group problem take group

366
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,429
action

367
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,120
so you don't go to the manager and say
hey I think we should do this because i

368
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,370
believe it's best for the group and
here's why I said you know we all got

369
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:05,439
together we decided that I out of the
team of five

370
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:12,159
these are the areas that we need
training in and we believe that Bob and

371
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,419
Suzanne should go

372
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,879
we don't feel we all need to go because
they'll come back and they'll share that

373
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,270
information so that we don't have to all
go out of the office and cost the

374
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,339
company a fortune

375
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:32,259
so wanting my grandmother used to say
and i'm sure i guarantee you someone in

376
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,889
this room

377
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,010
their grandmother grandfather said this
at one point

378
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,500
so as an only child I wanted a lot you
know I wanted to do toi I never got the

379
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,810
GI Joe aircraft carrier

380
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,290
I still want that to this day because I
never had it I could never get it is too

381
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:52,239
expensive so my grandmother used to look
me in the eye and say Andrew you can

382
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:58,810
want in one hand and shit in the other
and see which one fills first and to

383
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,230
this day I still I still think about
that when someone says they want

384
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,660
something because it's it's true that
you know you can say I want something I

385
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,890
want something I want something or you
can just uh huh

386
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,819
hey Angela I've got that now

387
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:19,300
so you need to really differentiate
between a need and want

388
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,440
do you need training or do you want
training you need to go to the

389
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,460
conference

390
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:33,280
you want to go to conference do you need
a vulnerability scanning tool or do you

391
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,619
just need to use what you already have

392
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:40,060
it's it's hard to distance yourself

393
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,250
from that decision because if you really
believe that it's something you need

394
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,350
it's hard to not convince yourself so
talk to some of your peers and say hey

395
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,549
do we really need this

396
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,530
I think we need it do we think we need
it or is this something that we would

397
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,810
want to make our jobs easier

398
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,810
oh my

399
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,000
so here's a little flow diagram they
wanna hear not have a sim in this day

400
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,970
and age one person

401
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:15,730
the guy who just gets going training
course in training so I need this thing

402
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,170
to do my job

403
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:22,720
I need it absolutely needed regulatory
compliance this is usually a very good

404
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,799
deciding factor

405
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,490
there's something mandate that I have to
have this yes

406
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,779
ok do we have anything that can't do
this now

407
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,480
no we have nothing I'm sorry i I'm sorry
sure that you don't have a tool that

408
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,710
already does this

409
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,420
yes then you need is him based on the
compliance right

410
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,740
do we have something that already does
it oh you just want a new sim you want a

411
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,500
new toy to make my job easier

412
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,010
so start thinking like this and
obviously you want to create flow chart

413
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,870
for every decision you make you'd never
get anything done but just start

414
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,740
thinking about you know

415
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,810
can I make do with what i have and even
in talking to management you can say you

416
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,910
know what I know we don't need a sim
right now but for the following reasons

417
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:19,029
we believe that this would help you meet
some of the business objectives that

418
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,470
you've lined out for this quarter

419
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:25,450
then a whole I do have objectives that
need to meet for this quarter

420
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,960
I'll get to that a little bit so
negotiating

421
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,230
I'm going to zip through this because
this could be an entire talk

422
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,360
I has anyone ever taken any negotiating
classes in business school or they're

423
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,670
fun and everyone uses the same business
cases when they do negotiating and most

424
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,049
of them come from

425
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:49,119
harvard business school and they just
keep using them because they're really

426
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,170
really good

427
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:59,799
so you should only go into a negotiation
when you don't have the power to bend

428
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,209
someone to your will

429
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:04,629
so if if i say to you hey I'm gonna

430
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:11,319
that laptops mine now here is no it's my
laptop so we negotiate

431
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,069
yeah I won't drag you into the parking
lot and be you and within an inch of

432
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:20,199
your life if you give me the laptop and
I kind of know how that negotiation

433
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,279
would end up

434
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:30,549
but i digress so you need to actually
follow steps in order to go through

435
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:36,788
negotiation and this becomes very
important when you are trying to bend

436
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:44,589
your manager or your team 802 what your
idea is so something

437
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:51,939
there's two types of negotiations there
is distributive where there's one winner

438
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:53,678
one loser

439
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,709
so I got a laptop you don't get a
beating

440
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:05,319
some would argue that that is win win
actually that would be integrative I'm

441
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:10,689
glad we're not doing reviews on mystics
threaten the audience so distributive is

442
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:14,890
really you know what I'm not going to
negotiate with you so that we can come

443
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:20,920
to you know a common term where we're
both happy and we hold hands and skip

444
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,809
away off for a offer beer because we're
both happy with the outcome

445
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,959
it is i'm going to win you're going to
lose and this is unfortunately what a

446
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:35,828
lot of practitioners go to their
management team with this is the way it

447
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:36,759
has to be

448
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:40,269
and they're like no that's not the way
it has to be

449
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:44,198
let me tell you the way it has to be
there is going to be one winner

450
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,050
there's going to be one loser

451
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:52,860
integrative is probably the most
beneficial negotiation

452
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:58,710
so this is so actually know what a great
example of distributive negotiation

453
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:06,660
who here has recently negotiated a
salary for themselves and you've got a

454
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,879
lot of problems

455
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,350
yeah so when you go and you say okay

456
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,029
why how much do you want and you say
well you know I want what's fair

457
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:26,730
oh well you know we're willing willing
to offer 85,000 year at school but I

458
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:31,110
asked for a hundred and fifty or hundred
seventy five thousand year

459
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,810
yeah we're only doing 85,000 that's kind
of a killer because what can you

460
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,910
negotiate they're not willing to
negotiate

461
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,660
so you have to either accept their 85
which a lot of people will do if they

462
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,149
don't have a lot of options or cfl
throwing some additional things because

463
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,260
they always have

464
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,930
there's always a wiggle room when they
say 85 that is not there it's not there

465
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,279
and that's an anchor that they said i'll
talk about that a minute here where

466
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:07,740
integrative is where you go to let's say
Chinatown in New York City and you see a

467
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,970
purse and warn you I don't do a lot of
her shopping so I can get this very

468
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,230
wrong and you go to the person and say
how much for the purse and they say ten

469
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,010
dollars

470
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:22,050
okay well you know what I think it's
only worth two are you crazy this is the

471
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,740
best person in the world you know you
ate

472
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,040
I give it to you for eight well I saw
this person around the corner

473
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,090
actually at every single store for i'll
give you four for it and then like all

474
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,030
right all right you're killin me you're
telling me six and then finally you

475
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,490
finish like 550 or something like that

476
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,350
they look upset you look upset because
it was so hard to get your price

477
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:54,119
but everyone walks away relatively happy
the store owner covered

478
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,440
what their cost was plus a little bit of
profit and you didn't have to pay the

479
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,619
full value that is an integrative
negotiation

480
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:06,058
whereas if you watch Pawn Stars

481
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:12,839
it's rarely ever integrative because
they just try and screw everybody so bat

482
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:18,420
best alternative to a negotiated
agreement if you do not have a bat

483
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,420
going into any sort of negotiation
you're ill prepared

484
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:25,200
so if you go i'll just take an example

485
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,700
vulnerability scanner we have to have a
vulnerability scanner here is the use

486
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:37,618
case we need two hundred fifty thousand
dollars in order to buy this for our

487
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:38,730
capabilities

488
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,150
so if you go in knowing that

489
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:50,339
250 is the lowest that you need to
actually get in and play then you kind

490
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:51,839
of screwed yourself on the anchor

491
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,000
because I'll get the anchors in a moment
here it's either going to be a take it

492
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,690
or leave it

493
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,250
because you put the price tags so low
that if they say no you got nowhere to

494
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:02,730
go

495
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,000
you can't just say oh you know what we
can do it for 50

496
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,829
that's why anchoring becomes actually
i'll skip is over

497
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:18,359
that's pain in the ass am I you know
what I don't think I talk about anchors

498
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:18,839
here

499
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,740
I could swear i decide to talk about
anchors

500
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,799
so this is an anchor this is an anchor

501
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:30,990
this is an anchor this is an anchor so
when you are going into a negotiation

502
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:38,400
let's say for a salary and you say i
want two hundred thousand

503
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,089
oh well so this is

504
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:45,890
well yeah you're the buyer I want two
hundred thousand dollars

505
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:52,009
they'll say well you know what we can
only we can only offer you 80 to a

506
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,329
hundred thousand dollars

507
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:59,359
ok well what I really meant was I wanted
a hundred and fifty you start

508
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,410
negotiating

509
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,819
if you go above you set your anchor this
is this is what you want

510
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:11,089
you would love to have this this anchor
is in your head your walk away price

511
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:18,529
so if 85 is still above your walk away
price

512
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:22,099
maybe you're you know this close to
living on the street you need a job any

513
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:30,349
job you might say okay okay i'll take
the 85 but if your walk away value is 90

514
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:33,349
and you know you can get a job somewhere
else for 85

515
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,009
they offer you 85 well let's blow your
walk away

516
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:44,059
he's no not going to do it sorry not
interested that's that's far too low but

517
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:51,259
it's all based on your alternatives and
if you don't have alternatives then

518
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:54,109
you're you're really handcuffed in the
way you can negotiate these kind of

519
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:54,828
things

520
00:44:54,829 --> 00:45:02,299
so I'm sure you've all heard of the
scottie principle if not most recent

521
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:06,829
times we can take around in eight weeks
out like you don't have eight weeks so I

522
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:12,440
do it funny into let's discuss and you
always multiplied your parents by a

523
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,869
factor of four seconds out

524
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:17,869
- can I keep my reputation and a medical
market

525
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:25,520
your reputation is secure Scotty so if
you think about that from a negotiation

526
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:34,640
point of view or a business need
business want the anchor was eight weeks

527
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,160
but i'll do it for you too

528
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:43,098
meaning that Scotty could probably get
it done in a week but - he's you know

529
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,900
he's buffering a little bit

530
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,410
ordinarily if it wasn't a dire situation
would be eight weeks you can take the

531
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:53,330
time to write a letter etc and the same
thing goes with any sort of negotiation

532
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,330
you should be doing for product
purchases for training

533
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,640
this will make sense in a moment here so
you in order to negotiate

534
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,510
you have to be prepared to walk away
from the good negotiation

535
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,650
sometimes that's not easy to do or not
possible

536
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:15,619
as such that means that your best
alternative is very weak

537
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:19,790
so you want a strong that net that's
alternative to a negotiated agreement

538
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:25,070
and if you quantify it even better

539
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,300
sometimes it's more of like a personal
life choice or desire

540
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:35,420
that's hard to quantify a little
intangible so now some examples

541
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:41,000
so we need to buy x tool product service
is anyone going to the management team

542
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,210
and said you know we need this before

543
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,599
yeah you got it right away right - yeah
sure

544
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,260
unlimited budget and let me shake the
money tree will get that so there's a

545
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,770
bad approach you know I need this
vulnerability scanner to find

546
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,759
vulnerabilities

547
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,420
probably not but all right

548
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,810
better approach we should look at
evaluating this tools that may provide

549
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,230
valuable information that may make the
objectives outlined in your vent

550
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,230
vulnerability management prague program
more readily achievable

551
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:19,190
so again we we meaning you and the boss
and your co-workers objectives outlined

552
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,830
in your or you can say our vulnerability
management program

553
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,069
if you say your vulnerability management
program

554
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:31,249
you're saying hey I know this is
important to you and it's one of your

555
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:32,269
objectives

556
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:35,299
it's important to all of us but it's
specifically important you I want to

557
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:38,449
help you make things better

558
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:41,869
if you say our means that you have a
vested interest that you're

559
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:45,109
communicating to them that it's
important for everyone

560
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:51,410
the better approach i find is that
initial piece plus this bottom we could

561
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,009
research this and see how it might
improve our overall security posture and

562
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:58,670
include a cost-benefit analysis to serve
as any savings that may result from its

563
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,930
implementation

564
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:04,368
you're hitting them where it matters in
the wallet hey we're going to spend some

565
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:07,489
money on this but I'm going to put
together a spreadsheet that shows you

566
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:11,299
how much we're going to save over time
and I guarantee you if you go to the

567
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:13,190
vendor and say hey I need this

568
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,279
they will have a can one that will take
just whip out so most your work is

569
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:17,119
already done

570
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,509
you just need to cutie it up a bit i
can't i'm too busy

571
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:29,239
this actually happened to me yesterday
when I ask someone for help

572
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:34,640
i can't i'm just too busy so then my CEO
message means it will why can't this

573
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,959
person do this

574
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:40,399
like they say they're busy i know that
they're working on something for one of

575
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,650
the other executives and the response
was no no that he's not too busy can

576
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,369
help with this

577
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:50,420
this is dumb go talk to it will make
this happen if you can't do it was get

578
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,549
rid of them like whoa slow down

579
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:57,799
you know it's not that important so if
you say i can't i'm too busy again

580
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:01,969
emotional response just I'm really busy
right now to even answer your question

581
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:04,099
of whether or not I can help you with
this

582
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:09,979
so based on the current workload and the
availability of resources wheel

583
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:15,529
so yeah I have to decide on what the
priorities are so collaborative

584
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:20,900
negotiation integrated we're going to
work on figuring this out

585
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:26,119
even better so to put it back in the
management sphere have any of our tasks

586
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:28,339
been reprioritized by the business

587
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:31,219
are there any time constraints are
pressing business needs that we need to

588
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:36,079
account for this is important this will
take your manager a moment the

589
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,619
sit back and think okay well is there
anything more important

590
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,130
yeah we do have all this other more
important stuff so let's do you

591
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,920
prioritize this stuff that I just asked
you to do

592
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,420
we'll focus on this you're right good
thing so I work my ass off and I deserve

593
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,549
training or whatever

594
00:49:55,549 --> 00:50:00,499
this is for you in the burgundy shirt
training raise and promotion

595
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:08,749
let me guess you have been promoted to a
later no oh alright so you told yourself

596
00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:10,669
you could come that at work

597
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,479
awesome so we've been leveraging yeah

598
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:17,569
keyword current skills of the team not
just you

599
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:23,329
of the team to complete our objectives
but there may be certain deficiencies we

600
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,999
could eliminate through formalized
training

601
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:29,328
so you're saying by learning something
new and bring it back into the

602
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,359
organization we can make the
organization better

603
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:37,609
so the sum of all the parts means the
whole is going to be that much better

604
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,779
even better so the good approach Plus
here's a recommended list of formal

605
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:46,009
training courses

606
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:51,469
that's a type of a breakdown of
associate expenses and a detailed

607
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:53,539
summary of the ROI

608
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:57,829
yeah as it maps to your 2016 security
program objectives

609
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,160
so you're putting this in their lapsing
here are the things that we should do

610
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:09,680
based on this list here's the return on
investment based on what the vendors

611
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,940
telling me what

612
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,630
whoever's telling me and why it's
important and how it's going to make the

613
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,630
security program that you are in charge
of that much better

614
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:29,330
so you should really work towards
becoming a business language polyglot

615
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,710
it's not easy like I said it does feel
dirty at first and it's not like you

616
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,610
have to go start talking to your spouse
about you know leveraging the meatloaf

617
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,760
to to synergize the potatoes

618
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,170
it's not that doesn't happen apartment

619
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,870
I you can try so has anyone ever heard
of time boxing before like thai boxing a

620
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,040
conversation so you're putting
constraints on how long a conversation

621
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,970
is going to go

622
00:51:55,970 --> 00:52:00,049
I work for the guy who learned this in
agile training and then he tried to

623
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:07,970
constrain his wife's conversations about
her day at work full-time boxes you have

624
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,009
15 minutes to tell me about your day

625
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,150
but after that we're going to move on to
something important did not go well for

626
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,440
him at all

627
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:23,840
not a good plan so use business language
like cursing and swearing

628
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:35,000
there's a proper time and sometimes a
negative impact associated when if you

629
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,520
look at that complaint methodology kind
of chart that I built

630
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:46,250
go through that obviously refine it for
your problems your issues and really

631
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,650
your own style of how to communicate
things and make sure that if you have to

632
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:56,510
negotiate because you will have to
negotiate with terrorists

633
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:03,440
that's just the way it is you know have
to know your bet your Batna best

634
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,990
alternative to a negotiated agreement

635
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,080
it just kind of rolls off the tongue

636
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,790
after a while and you need to know your
baton it because you want to make sure

637
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:19,009
that you don't get less than what you're
willing to accept and it's it takes

638
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:26,840
practice and honestly if if your local
college like Community College

639
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,070
University College whatever

640
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,430
if they offer negotiating class they're
generally not gonna be that expensive

641
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:39,030
I suggest taking it because if you want
to if you want to think of it a

642
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,020
different way

643
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,080
you're learning how to social engineer
management which sounds a lot cooler

644
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,730
than negotiating your battlenet you're
trying to bend them to your will and

645
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,850
they will give you the tips and tricks
on how to actually do that

646
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,850
it's great you can really screw with
people

647
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,110
how many met ten minutes 40

648
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:06,660
all right I tend to ignore the just let
you know these are some books that if

649
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,640
you're very very quick reading
negotiation

650
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:16,200
this is what they teach her business
school

651
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,080
you can save yourself a boatload of
money just by getting this book it's

652
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:26,400
only about that that maybe 200 pages
influenced by Geraldine e because how

653
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,090
you say his name

654
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:32,700
very good book and getting past know
this is a really good book if your boss

655
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,850
says to you know we're not going to do
that all the time

656
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:41,339
this will help you social engineer him
to get that no into a maybe

657
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:50,430
and eventually into a yes so with that
and with only 75 minutes left of time

658
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:53,520
they don't have any questions

659
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:09,150
yes

660
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:20,579
yeah but yes

661
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:26,789
so so my last class in in my certificate
program

662
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:31,140
it's predominantly focused on emotional
intelligence and I just kind of go

663
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:35,849
you know it's very touchy feely it's not
tangible

664
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:42,539
you know I i'm used to work with data
analyzing things analytically but to

665
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,289
your point

666
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:47,699
yes the methodology can be used in the
same way

667
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:52,019
it's if you think about it most of these
people that have written books and then

668
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:55,019
develop these methodologies or paradigms

669
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:59,699
we're probably all in class together at
one point or another and have read each

670
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:02,579
other's work and they just say hey you
know what

671
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:06,479
that's a cool idea I'm going to give it
a new name for this model and i'm going

672
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:08,069
to change it up a little bit

673
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:12,599
you see that a lot with the especially
emotional intelligence stuff very

674
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:13,559
similar

675
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,459
yeah you're you're right it's it's
similar

676
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:35,429
you can provided you are actually
willing to walk away so you can feign

677
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:38,939
that you're gonna walk away in the hopes
that someone's going to come back and

678
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:44,279
say hey you know what you're right let's
come back to the table that may not be

679
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:45,150
the case

680
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,959
so if you you have to be prepared to
physically walk away and never go back

681
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:53,880
and sometimes that's not easy at times
it is negotiating tactic it happens to

682
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,799
politics all the time in the enterprise
though it's a little bit harder because

683
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:03,538
usually you're walk away . is I'm going
to quit and like all right

684
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:08,339
see ya we don't know I didn't really
mean that I don't want to quit I i just

685
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:12,600
wanted to talk about this more but not
you quit see it

686
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,720
so you really have to be prepared to
walk away

687
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:23,910
you gotta log rolling ok cool so I'm
gonna be around the rest of the day and

688
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,140
all day tomorrow

689
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,830
if you have any questions please feel
free to stop me hope you enjoy this

690
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:34,950
little bit heavy after lunch but if you
had taco bell it really wasn't much but

691
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,439
it really food either so yeah right

692
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:37,650
thank you
